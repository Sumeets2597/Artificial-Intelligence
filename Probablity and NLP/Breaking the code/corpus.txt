it
did
find
that
many
of

are
outmoded

inadequate

often
ambiguous

act
to
have
these

studied

revised

the
end
of
modernizing

improving
them

said
they
realize
a

we
feel
that

staggered

the

the
medical

cannot
now

the

to
meet
the
rising
need
for

he

opposed
placing

criticized
the

who
backed
a
similar

the

there

of

even
tougher

at

however
was
the
further
complication
that
the
administration
had
very
early
concluded
that
was
ill
suited
to
be
an
ally
unlike
its
more
determined
neighbors
and

displayed
after
it
was
clear
the

not
back

the

ever
had
any

that
it
could
find
an
acceptable
alternative

it
felt

was
the
statement
of
of

a
half
ago

deeply
concerned
over
this

and
its
effect
upon

an
important
assertion
of

an
executive
order
establishing
the
committee
on

to
be
supported
and
assisted
by
a
of
recognized
authorities
on

asks
the
support
and
cooperation
of
in
his

the
enactment
of
legislation
to

for

also
called
upon
the
the
of
and
and
the
of
to
coordinate
their
efforts
in
the
development
of
a
program
of
federal
leadership
to
assist
states
and
local
communities
in
their
efforts
to
cope
with
the
problem
the
announced
the
appointment
of
a
special
assistant
to
the
as
executive
director
of
the
new
on
and
sense
of
urgency
in
this
matter
stems
from
the
fact
that
court
cases
and
juvenile
arrests
have
more
than
doubled
since
each
year
showing
an
increase
in
offenders
arrests
reported
by
the
of
in
about
half
for
burglary
and
larceny
involved
persons
under
years
of
age
should
organize
its
civil
defense
setup
and
begin
by
appointing
a
director
the
present
city
head
believes
said
yesterday
he
would
be
willing
to
go
before
the
city
council
or
anyone
else
locally
to
outline
his
proposal
at
the
earliest
possible
time
now
has
no
civil
defense
program
the
general
treasurer
has
been
a
director
in
the
city
for
the
last
nine
years
is
not
interested
in
being
named
a
director
that
has
handed
the
the
major
responsibility
for
the
civil
defense
program
said
the
federal
government
would
pay
half
the
salary
of
a
local
director
expressed
the
opinion
the
city
could
hire
a
director
for
about
a
year
and
would
only
have
to
put
up
half
that
amount
on
a
matching
fund
basis
to
defray
the
salary
costs
said
he
believed
there
are
a
number
of
qualified
city
residents
who
would
be
willing
to
take
the
job
of
these
men
is
former
he
said
with
a
director
the
city
should
provide
a
headquarters
so
that
pertinent
information
about
the
local
organization
would
be
centralized
said
advantage
that
would
come
to
the
city
in
having
a
director
he
said
is
that
would
become
eligible
to
apply
to
the
federal
government
for
financial
aid
in
purchasing
equipment
needed
for
a
sound
civil
defense
program
funds
also
can
be
obtained
for
procurement
of
such
items
as
radios
sirens
and
rescue
trucks
he
said
believes
that
could
use
two
more
rescue
trucks
similar
to
the
vehicle
obtained
several
years
ago
and
now
detailed
to
the
would
assign
one
of
the
rescue
trucks
to
the
section
of
the
city
and
the
other
to
the
area
of
the
present
status
of
civil
defense
in
the
city
said
he
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
not
more
than
one
person
in
a
hundred
would
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
in
the
event
of
an
enemy
attack
grounds
is
one
assembly
point
he
said
and
a
theater
in
would
be
another
residents
would
go
to
the
assembly
point
said
he
was
not
critical
of
city
residents
for
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
where
to
assemble
in
case
of
an
air
attack
vital
information
he
said
has
to
be
made
available
to
the
public
frequently
and
at
regular
intervals
for
residents
to
know
the
city
council
fails
to
consider
appointment
of
a
director
said
then
he
plans
to
call
a
meeting
early
in
so
that
a
civil
defense
organization
will
be
developed
locally
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
he
said
would
be
to
organize
classes
in
first
aid
steps
would
be
developed
after
information
drifts
down
to
the
local
level

the
federal

going
to
examine
its
sales
law

the
exact
manner

in
recent
weeks
been
of
the
opinion
that
a
special
town

would
be

while

that
a
special

might
be
called
instead

and
report
back
to
the

as
soon
as
possible

meet
again
to

further
strategy
in
the
charter
movement
said
that
the
group
has
no
candidates
for
the
charter
commission
in
mind
at
present
but
that
it
will
undoubtedly
endorse
candidates
when
the
time
comes
inspiring
this
think
we
should
certainly
follow
through
on
it
he
declared
has
become
our
responsibility
and
hope
that
the
will
spearhead
the
movement
said
he
would
not
be
surprised
if
some
of
the
more
than
members
of
the
group
are
interested
in
running
on
the
required
ballot
for
posts
on
the
charter
commission
most
immediate
goal
is
to
increase
public
awareness
of
the
movement
he
indicated
and
to
tell
them
what
this
will
mean
for
the
town

that
if
the
present
timetable
is
followed
a
vote
will
be
scheduled

speaking
out
against

in
favor
of
the
model
municipal
league
charter
opposition
can
be
expected
in
coming
weeks
it
was
indicated
of
the
real
meaning
of
a
home

charter
was
cited
as
a
factor
which
has
caused
the
to
obtain
signatures
under
what
were
termed
false
pretenses
signers
affixed
their
names
it
was
learned
after
being
told
that
no
tax
increase
would
be
possible
without
consent
of
the
and
that
a
provision
could
be
included
in
the
charter
to
have
the
town
take
over
the
sewer
system
on
a
new
ordinance
permitting
motorists
who
plead
guilty
to

adopt
such
an
ordinance
as
a
means
of
making

more
effective

been
done
yet
to
take
advantage
of
the
enabling
legislation
present
all
offenses
must
be
taken
to
for
disposition
police
have
hesitated
to
prosecute
them
because
of
the
heavy
court
costs
involved
even
for
the
simplest
offense
and
last
night
disagreed
on
the
value
of
using
as
a
campaign
issue
a
remark
by
gubernatorial
candidate
that
the
is
on
the
carcass
of
was
for
using
it
against
and
did
not
mention
it
when
the
three
gubernatorial

spoke
at
staggered
intervals

forum
of
the
of
said
is
the
apparent
intention
of
the
to
campaign
on
the
carcass
of
what
they
call
but
the
heart
stopped
beating
and
the
lifeblood
congealed
after
retired
gone
the
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
sell
the
tattered
remains
to
the
people
of
the
state
he
had
added
can
love
the
man
even
if
we
considered
him
a
mediocre
president
but
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
without
his
leadership
said
the
statement
should
become
a
major
issue
in
the
primary
and
the
fall

absorbed
his
philosophy
while
working
in
his
adminstration
said
the
closeness
of
the
outcome
in
last
election
did
not
mean
that
was
a
dead
issue
attack
said
he
regretted
had
made
a
personal
attack
on
a
past
president
is
wrong
to
inject
into
this
campaign
he
said
because
the
primary
is
being
waged
on
state
issues
and
will
not
be
forced
into
an
old
national
campaign
audience
last
night
did
not
respond
with
either
applause
or
boos
to
mention
of
remark
spoke
on
the
merit
of
having
an
open
primary
then
launched
into
what
the
issues
should
be
in
the
campaign

decried
the
high
rate
of
unemployment
in
the
state
and
said
the
administration
and
the
share
the
blame
for
this
that
last
year
had
lost
the
plant
he
said
industry
will
not
come
into
this
state
until
there
is
tax
reform
am
not
in
favor
of
a
sales
or
state
income
tax
at
this
time
said
unhappy
that
the
candidates
were
limited
to
eight
minutes
for
a
speech
and
no
audience
questions
saved
his
barbs
for

against
the
centralization
of

looks
to
the

aid
to
meet

and
transportation
crises
calls
for

while
saying
he
is
against

but
you
have
it
both
ways
said
state
is
now
faced
with
the
immediate
question
of
raising
new
taxes
whether
on
utilities
real

or
motor
vehicles
he
said
and
challenge
to
tell
the
people
where
he
stands
on
the
tax
issue
said
in
a
statement
think
that
all
will
resent
deeply
the
statements
made
about
by
reference
to
discredited
carcass
or
tattered
remains
of
the
leadership
is
an
insult
to
the
man
who
led
our
forces
to
victory
in
the
greatest
war
in
all
history
to
the
man
who
was
twice
elected
overwhelmingly
by
the
people
as
president
of
the
and
who
has
been
the
symbol
to
the
world
of
the
intentions
of
the
free
nations
find
it
hard
to
understand
how
anyone
seeking
a
position
in
public
life
could
demonstrate
such
poor
judgment
and
bad
taste
a
vicious
statement
can
only
have
its
origin
in
the
desire
of
a
new
political
candidate
to
try
to
make
his
name
known
by
condemning
a
man
of
world
stature

only
rebound
to

no

has
surrounded
himself
with
confusion
which
not
only
keeps
his
foes
guessing

his
friends
as
well
it
is
uncertain
after
nearly
months
in

just
which
direction
the
administration
will
take
in
the
coming

predict
the

settle
down

iron
out
the
rough
edges
which
it
has
had
thus
far
builtin
headache
of

thus
far
has

the
steady
stream
of
and
others
who
feel
they
were
given
commitments
by
at
some
stage
of
his
quest
for
the
office
are
many
who
predict
that
should
decide
to
call
the
back
into
special
session
it
will
really
throw
his
administration
into
a
scramble
nobody
will
predict
that
the
next
time
the
lawmakers
come
back
together
will
be
able
to
enjoy
a
of
the
strange
but
successful
honeymoon
he
had
in
the
legislative
session
call
a
special
session
in
it
will
be
the
first
year
in
the
last
decade
that
the

not

in

special

odds

a

in

issue
always
get
restless
for
a
special

whether
for
the
companionship
or
the
per

is
not
certain
and
if
they
start
agitating
is
not
expected
to
be
able
to
withstand
the
pressure
issue
which
may
make
it
necessary
to
have
a
session
is
the
highly
sensitive
problem
of
cutting
the
congressional
districts
from
six
to
five
to
eliminate
one
congressional
seat
eyes
focused
on
the
third
congressional
district
the
historic
district
and
as
the
one
most
likely
to
go
the
redistricting
battle
will
put
to
a
test
the
longstanding
power
which
lawmakers
from
the
have
held
in
the
relations
with
the
national
party
will
be
at
a
crossroads
during

the
first
president
in
eight
years
in
the
badly
during
the
recent
presidential
election
into
almost
equally
divided
camps
of
party
loyalists
and
independents
the
party
in
is
currently
a
wreck
there
has
been
no
effort
since
the
election
to
pull
it
back
together
clouded
as
the
titular
head
of
the
party
apparently
must
make
the
move
to
reestablish
relations
with
the
national
party
or
see
a
movement
come
from
the
loyalist
ranks
to
completely
bypass
him
as
a
party
functionary
a
administration
party
patronage
would
normally
begin
to
flow
to
if
it
had
held
its
solidarity
in
the
election
the
picture
is
clouded
and
even
and
who
remained
loyal
to
the
ticket
are
uncertain
of
their
status
are
that
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
four
congressmen
from
who
did
not
support
the
party
ticket
will
be
stripped
of
the
usual
patronage
which
flows
to
congressmen
administration
appears
to
face
a
difficult
year
in
with
the
theme
of
peace
and
harmony
subjected
to
severe
stresses
year
will
probably
start
out
with
segregation
still
the
most
troublesome
issue
it
might
give
way
shortly
to
another
vexing
issue
that
of
finances
in
state
government
transition
from
segregation
to
finances
might
already
be
in
progress
in
the
form
of
an
administration
proposal
to
hike
the
state
sales
tax
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
administration
has
said
the
sales
tax
proposal
is
merely
part
of
the
segregation
strategy
since
the
revenues
from
the
increase
would
be
dedicated
to
a
grant
in
aid
program
the
tardiness
of
the
administration
in
making
the
dedication
has
caused
legislators
to
suspect
the
tax
bill
was
related
more
directly
to
an
shortage
of
cash
than
to
segregation
weary
the
curious
position
on
the
sales
tax
was
a
major
factor
in
contributing
to
its
defeat
administration
could
not
say
why
million
was
needed
for
a
program
effectiveness
of
the
governor
in
clearing
up
some
of
the
inconsistencies
revolving
about
the
sales
tax
bill
may
play
a
part
in
determining
whether
it
can
muster
the
required
vote
tax
bill
will
be
up
for
reconsideration
in
the
when
the
reconvenes
may
use
the
tax
bill
as
a
means
to
effect
a
transition
from
special
sessions
of
the
to
normalcy
it
fails
to
pass
he
can
throw
up
his
hands
and
say
the
would
not
support
him
in
his
efforts
to
prevent
integration
could
terminate
special
sessions
of
the
would
have
to
toss
in
the
towel
soon
anyway
legislators
are
already
weary
and
frustrated
over
the
losing
battle
to
block
token
integration
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
most
politicos
would
care
to
acknowledge
publicly
would
like
to
convey
the
notion
something
is
being
done
even
though
it
is
something
they
know
to
be
ineffectual
concern
of
the
sales
tax
measure
would
also
give
the
means
to
effect
a
transition
could
tell
the
they
had
provided
the
needed
funds
to
carry
on
the
battle
he
could
tell
them
to
go
home
while
the
administration
continued
to
wage
the
battle
with
the
million
in
extra
revenues
the
sales
tax
measure
would
bring
in
over
an
eight
months
period
is
difficult
to
be
certain
how
the
administration
views
that
million
since
the
views
of
one
leader
may
not
be
the
same
as
the
views
of
another
one
if
the
administration
should
find
it
does
not
need
the
million
for
a
program
a
not
unlikely
conclusion
it
could
very
well
seek
a
way
to
use
the
money
for
other
purposes
would
be
in
perfect
consonance
with
the
underlying
concern
in
the
administration
the
shortage
of
cash
could
become
an
acute
problem
in
the
coming
fiscal
year
the
administration
does
not
succeed
in
passing
the
sales
tax
bill
or
any
other
tax
bill
it
could
very
well
be
faced
this
spring
at
the
fiscal
session
of
the
with
an
interesting
dilemma
the
constitution
forbids
introduction
of
a
tax
bill
at
a
fiscal
session
the
administration
will
either
have
to
cut
down
expenses
or
inflate
its
estimates
of
anticipated
revenues
problem
either
case
it
could
call
a
special
session
of
the
later
in
to
make
another
stab
at
raising
additional
revenues
through
a
tax
raiser
prospect
of
cutting
back
spending
is
an
unpleasant
one
for
any
governor
is
one
that
most
try
to
avoid
as
long
as
they
can
see
an
alternative
approach
to
the
problem
if
all
alternatives
should
be
clearly
blocked
off
it
can
be
expected
the
administration
will
take
steps
to
trim
spending
at
the
spring
session
of
the
state
might
be
done
to
arouse
those
who
have
been
squeezed
out
by
the
trims
to
exert
pressure
on
the
so
it
would
be
more
receptive
to
a
tax
proposal
later
in
the
year
constant
problem
confronting
on
any
proposals
for
new
taxes
will
be
the
charge
by
his
foes
that
he
has
not
tried
to
economize
tax
bill
also
will
revive
allegations
that
some
of
his
followers
have
been
using
their
administration
affiliations
imprudently
to
profit
themselves
new

might
see
some
either
genuine
or
token
depending
upon
developments
to
give
an
opportunity
to
combat
some
of
these
criticisms

the

assistant

of
state
for

affairs
told
members
of
the
night
who
has
been
in
office
in
for

spoke
at
the
annual
meeting
at
the
told
some
persons
that
the
challenge
was
to
help
countries
build
their
own
societies
their
own
ways
following
their
own
paths
must
persuade
them
to
enjoy
a
way
of
life
which
if
not
identical
is
congenial
with
ours
he
said
but
adding
that
if
they
do
not
develop
the
kind
of
society
they
themselves
want
it
will
lack
ritiuality
and
loyalty
needed
that
the
countries
have
a
freedom
of
choice
he
said
was
the
biggest
detriment
to
the
cited
where
after
years
of
rule
it
has
become
necessary
to
build
a
wall
to
keep
the
people
in
and
added
so
long
as
people
rebel
we
must
not
give
up
called
for

on

trying

we
took
a

the
gives
other
peoples
the
opportunity
to
see
us
and
to
compare
he
said
help
best
have
no
reason
to
fear
failure
but
we
must
be
extraordinarily
patient
the
assistant
secretary
said
said
the
could
best
help
foreign
countries
by
helping
them
help
themselves
business
is
more
effective
than
government
aid
he
explained
because
individuals
are
able
to
work
with
the
people
themselves
must
plan
to
absorb
the
exported
goods
of
the
country
at
what
he
termed
a
social
cost
said
the

has
been
working

establish
firmer
prices
on
primary
products
which
may
involve
the

school
board
was
asked
to
take
a
positive
stand
towards
developing
and
coordinating
with
civil
defense
more
plans
for
the
schools
in
event
of
attack
there
seemed
to
be
some
difference
of
opinion
as
to
how
far
the
board
should
go
and
whose
advice
it
should
follow
board
members
after
hearing
the
coordination
plea
from
said
they
thought
they
had
already
been
cooperating
pointed
out
that
perhaps
this
was
not
strictly
a
school
board
problem
in
case
of
atomic
attack
but
that
the
board
would
cooperate
so
far
as
possible
to
get
the
children
to
where
the
parents
wanted
them
to
go
superintendent
said
he
thought
the
schools
were
waiting
for
some
leadership
perhaps
on
the
national
level
to
make
sure
that
whatever
steps
of
planning
they
took
would
be
more
fruitful
and
that
he
had
found
that
other
school
districts
were
not
as
far
along
in
their
planning
as
this
district
has
said
they
would
send
the
children
to
their
homes
in
case
of
disaster
he
said
really
expects
to
evacuate
think
everybody
is
agreed
that
we
need
to
hear
some
voice
on
the
national
level
that
would
make
some
sense
and
in
which
we
would
have
some
confidence
in
following
who
kept
reiterating
her
request
that
they
please
take
a
stand
said
must
have
faith
in
somebody
on
the
local
level
and
it
be
possible
for
everyone
to
rush
to
a
school
to
get
their
children
said
that
there
seemed
to
be
feeling
that
evacuation
plans
even
for
a
high
school
where
there
were
lots
of
cars
might
not
be
realistic
and
would
not
work
asked
again
that
the
board
join
in
taking
a
stand
in
keeping
with
program
board
said
it
thought
it
had
gone
as
far
as
instructed
so
far
and
asked
for
more
information
to
be
brought
at
the
next
meeting
was
generally
agreed
that
the
subject
was
important
and
the

should
be
informed

some
of
them
seem

down
kind
of
like

very
often
your

gets
off

about

dead

crucified
him

nailed
it
for

short
one

two
more

before
they

it

the
greatest
collectors
of

apparently
now
has
found
a
productive

in

the
former

general
came
off
the

for
his
debut
with

directed
his

would
solve

and
out
linebackers
played
exceptionally
well
said
after
he
and
his
staff
reviewed
movies
of
the
game
fact
our
whole
defensive
unit
did
a
good
job
won
the
game
through
ball
control
with
throwing
only
passes
always
like
to
keep
the
ball
as
much
as
we
can
against
because
they
have
such
an
explosive
attack
explained
can
be
going
along
doing
little
damage
then
bang
bang
they
can
hit
a
couple
of
passes
on
you
for
touchdowns
and
put
you
in

on
those
home
courts
they

that
the

advantage
can
be

that
it
take
a
super
team
to
do
it
found
a
way
to
win
a
baseball
game
last
night
pitched
a
game
said
to
be
the
first
in
baseball
history
as
the
and
beat
at
victory
was
the
first
of
the
season
for
the
after
nine
defeats

a

was

also
had
a
big
night
at

with
four
hits
in
five
trips
including
a
double
also
was
with
two
doubles
and
had
a

run
and
a

to
be
in

again
today
with

that
contented
cows
give

why
happy
ball
players
produce
more
base
hits
two
top
talents
of
the
time
and
have
hit
the
ball
harder
and
more
successfully
so
far
this
early
season
than
at
any
period
in
careers
which
to
be
frank
about
it
never
have
quite
reached
expectations
meant
as
a
boost
not
a
knock
and
both
men
at
have
so
much
ability
that
baseball
men
agree
never
hit
the
heights
heights
that
is
the
blond

sensational
season
when

terror

would
be

the
ultimate

most
players

not
by

for
best
years
were
when
he
hit
with
homers
and
when
he
belted
home
runs
drove
in
and
stole
bases
apparently
happier
under
new
managers
and
the
perfect
players
are
behaving
as
though
going
to
pass
those
previous
peaks
relations
we
know
professionals
men
paid
to

they
care
how
handled
just
as
long
as
their
names
are
spelled
correctly
on
the
first

fifteenth
of
each
month
truth
is
though
that
men
react
differently
to
different
treatment
that
matter
is
rare
possessing
the
disposition
that
enabled
him
to
put
out
the

seven

his
opinions

not
his

resented
attempts
to
push
and
prod
him
into
the
perfection
the
veteran
manager
saw
as
a
thrilling
possibility
old
man
was
almost
too
possessive
inherited
but
he
brought

the
majors

the

much

early
days

the
hottest
thing
that
has
hit
the
investment
community
in
years
was
the
stock
issue
which
was
sold
to
the
public
during
the
past
week
many
reasons
the
demand
to
buy
shares
in
the
company
was
tremendous
was
not
a
case
of
the
investment
bankers
having
to
sell
the
stock
it
was
more
one
of
allotting
a
few
shares
to
a
number
of
customers
and
explaining
to
others
why
they
had
no
more
to
sell
who
wanted
shares
in
many
cases
ended
up
with
and
customers
who
had
put
in
a
bid
to
buy
shares
found
themselves
with
and
counted
themselves
lucky
to
get
that
many
fact
very
few
customers
anywhere
in
the
nation
were
able
to
get
more
than
shares
investment
firms
got
only
shares
for
all
of
their
customers
measure
of
how
hot
the
stock
was
can
be
found
in
what
happened
to
it
on
the
market
as
soon
as
trading
began
stock
was
sold
in
the
underwriting
at
a
price
of
a
share
first
trade
afternoon
at
the
managing
underwriter
was
at
a
share
from
that
the
stock
moved
right
on
up
until
it
was
trading
morning
at
around
a
share
the
issue
was
hot
long
before
it
was
on
the
market
from
the
moment
the
reports
of
the
coming
issue
first
started
circulating
in
last
the
inquiries
and
demand
for
the
stock
started
building
up
by
the
reams
came
in
from
investment
firms
all
over
the
nation
all
of
them
wanting
to
get
a
part
of
the
shares
that
would
be
sold
to
the
public
at
with
another
reserved
for
employes
at
a
share
was
even
a
cable
in
from
a
bank
in
that
had
somehow
learned
about
the
stock
offering
subscribe
shares
of
of
confirmation
it
said
translated
could
not
let
the
bank
have
even
shares
it
allotted
shares
to
underwriters
and
selling
group
members
from
coast
to
coast
there
were
not
many
shares
for
anyone
the
result
of
it
all
was
partner
believes
an
effective
distribution
of
the
stock
to
owners
all
over
the
nation
feel
confident
the
stock
will
qualify
for
the
national
list
he
said
meaning
its
market
price
would
be
quoted
regularly
in
newspapers
all
over
the
country
was
also
pleased
with
the
wide
distribution
because
he
thought
it
proved
again
his
argument
that
investment
men
can
do
just
as
good
a
job
as
the
big
investment
bankers
claim
only
they
can
do
what
made
the
stock
issue
such
a
hot
one
answer
is
that
it
was
a
combination
of
circumstances
the
general
stock
market
has
been
boiling
upward
for
the
last
few
months
driving
stocks
of
all
kinds
up
a
result
it
is
not
easy
to
find
a
stock
priced
as
the
issue
was
priced
at
roughly
times
earnings
to
yield
a
little
over
per
cent
on
the
anticipated
dividend
the
potato
chip
industry
has
caught
the
fancy
of
investors
lately
and
until
came
along
there
were
only
two
potato
chip
stocks
and
on
the
market
of
those
have
had
dynamic
in
price
on
the
market
in
recent
months
both
were
selling
at
higher
and
yield
bases
than
was
coming
to
market
at
and
everyone
who
knew
anything
about
it
expected
the
stock
to
have
a
fast
third
the
potato
chip
industry
has
taken
on
the
flavor
of
a
growth
industry
in
the
public
mind
of
late
which
long
had
been
considered
recession
resistant
but
hardly
dynamic
stocks
have
been
acting
like
growth
stocks
going
to
higher
ratios
potato
chip
industry
these
days
is
growing
not
only
as
a
result
of
population
increase
and
public
acceptance
of
convenience
foods
but
also
because
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
has
led
to
growth
by
merger
history
of
the
potato
chip
industry
is
that
many
of
successful
companies
got
started
during
the
deep
depression
days
that
remain
are
those
that
were
headed
by
strong
executives
men
with
the
abilities
to
last
almost
years
in
the
competitive
survival
of
the
fittest
today
many
of
those
men
are
reaching
retirement
age
and
suddenly
realizing
that
they
face
an
estate
tax
problem
with
their
closely
held
companies
and
also
that
they
have
no
management
in
their
firms
they
go
looking
for
mergers
with
other
firms
that
have
publicly
quoted
stock
and
almost
daily
they
pound
on
the
doors
of
firms
like
those
things
combined
to
make
the
stock
the
hot
issue
that
it
was
and
is
if
newest
product
a
corn
chip
known
as
turns
out
to
sell
as
well
as
its
stock
did
the
stock
may
turn
out
to
be
worth
every
cent

the

the
avid

bid
it
up
to

the

he

the

but
there
is

to

the

will
not

as
in

and
refuted
strongly
refuted
the
current
thesis
that
we

facing
a

of

declaring
that
this
pessimism
is
based
on
very
limited
and
questionable
evidence
than
viewing
the
abortive
recovery
in
as
a
reason
for
believing
we

lost

lesson
well
learned
which
will

in

the

in

may

economist

not
look
for
a
drastic
switch
in

it
even
more
unlikely
that
the
will
aggressively
tighten
monetary
policy
in
the
early
phases
of
the
upturn
as
was
the
case
in
unsatisfactory
expansion
he
said
was
not
due
to
inadequate
growth
forces
inherent
in
our
economy
but
rather
to
the
adverse
effect
of
inappropriate
economic
policies
combined
with
retrenching
decisions
resulting
from
the
steel
strike
needed
declared
see

this

never
faced
such
great
dangers
as

us
today

justify
our

an

the

collections
being
introduced
in

has
been
some
avant

indication
that
contemporary
furniture
might
go
back
to
the
boxy
look
of
the
and
two
manufacturers
chose
to
take
the
approach
of
the
sophisticated
but
warm
look
in
contemporary
two
and
chose
too
not
to
produce
the
exactly
matching
design
for
every
piece
but
a
collection
of
correlated
designs
each
of
which
could
stand
alone
collection
to
be
shown
by
and
has
perhaps
more
different
types
of
woods
and
decorations
than
any
one
manufacturer
ever
assembled
together
at
one
time
to
indicate
its
lasting
good

put
an

to
the

practicing
put
the

away

took
out
some
linen
needles
and
yarn
to
while
away
the
long
idle
days
in
her
modern
tapestries
have
been
exhibited
on
two
continents
and
at
she
feels
she
is
on
the
threshold
of
a
whole
new
life
in
days
as
an
art
student
at
the
of
came
to
a
sudden
end
during
the
uprisings
in
and
she
and
her
husband
fled
to
they
continued
their
studies
at
the
university
she
in
art
he
in
architecture
there
she
had
her
first
showing
of
tapestry
work
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
problem
of
education
in
today
most
people
seem
to
realize
if
they
tied
up
with
the
thing
as
am
is
that
of
the
problem
is
transportation
never
dreamed
of
the
logistical
difficulties
involved
until
at
long
last
both
of
my
boys
got
squeezed
into
high
school
seems
like
only
last
year
that
we
watched
them
set
out
up
the
hill
hand
in
hand
on
a
rainy
day
in
their
yellow
raincoats
to
at
the
grammar
school
to
and
from
school
was
no
problem
either
walked
or
were
driven
they
go
to
a
high
school
that
is
two
miles
away
might
think
the
problem
would
be
similar
could
walk
ride
on
a
bus
or
be
driven
much
more
complex
than
that
they
go
to
school
with
a
girl
named
who
lives
down
the
block
and
has
a
car
is
a
way
of
getting
to
school
but
understand
it
entails
a
certain
loss
of
social
status
young
man
like
to
be
driven
up
in
front
of
a
school
in
a
car
driven
by
a
girl
who
even
in
a
higher
class
than
he
is
and
is
also
a
girl
you
walk
to
school
then
suggested
father
walked
through
two
miles
of
snow
in
you
was
asked
said
happen
to
grow
up
in
explained
however
that
had
my
share
of
hardship
in
making
my
daily
pilgrimage
to
the
feet
of
wisdom
had
to
ride
a
streetcar
two
miles
the
streetcar
was
late
there
even
any
seats
had
to
stand
up
with
the
ladies
got
on
the
wrong
car
and
get
to
school
at
all
but
wound
up
at
the
ocean
or
some
other
dismal
place
and
had
to
spend
the
day
there
tried
to
compromise
by
letting
them
take
the
little
car
now
and
then
they
do
that
my
wife
has
to
drive
me
to
work
in
the
big
car
has
to
have
at
least
one
car
herself
feel
a
certain
loss
of
status
when
am
driven
up
in
front
of
work
in
a
car
driven
by
my
wife
who
is
only
a
woman
that
satisfactory
they
have
to
take
any
car
rather
take
the
big
one
say
that
when
they
take
a
car
take
her
car
but
rides
with
them
when
rides
with
them
they
also
have
to
take
the
two
girls
who
usually
ride
with
her
so
the
little
car
big
enough
logic
of
that
is
impeccable
of
course
except
that
feel
like
a
fool
being
driven
up
to
work
in
a
little
car
by
my
wife
when
everybody
knows
have
a
big
car
and
am
capable
of
driving
myself
solution
naturally
is
the
bus
a
walk
down
a
steep
hill
from
our
house
to
the
bus
and
too
hard
on
my
legs
wife
could
drive
us
down
the
hill
and
we
could
all
walk
from
there
hardly
realistic
walks
anymore
but
crackpots
and
and
already
got
an
education

using

for

bases
children
love
the
animated
puppet
faces
and
their
flexible
bodies
and
they
prefer
to
see
them
as
though
the
puppets
were
in

rather
than
put

in

as
lamps
the
puppets
delight
the

order
a

shop
the

to
determine
the
height
of

passes
is

about
three

that

the
strings
that
manipulate
the
puppet
suspend
him
from

light
fixture
by
tying

this

you

the

you

a

shade
would
be

constructive

which
opened
a
series
of
performances
night
at

is
think
the
finest
classical
ballet
company
have
ever
seen
and
the
production
of
the
with
which
it
began
the
series
is
incomparably
the
finest
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
work
is
no
favorite
of
mine
am
prepared
to
demonstrate
at
anytime
that
it
represents
the
spirit
of
in
its
most
vulgar
infantile
and
reactionary
aspect
that
its
persistent
use
by
ballet
companies
of
the
regime
indicates
that
that
old
spirit
is
just
as
stultifying
alive
today
as
it
ever
was
that
its
presentation
in
this
country
is
part
of
a
capitalist
plot
to
boobify
the
people
that
its
choreography
is
undistinguished
and
its
score
a
shapeless
assemblage
of
of
this
is
true
and
all
of
it
is
totally
meaningless
in
the
face
of
the
utterly
captivating
presentation
reasons
for
this
enchantment
are
numerous
but
most
of
them
end
in
ova
eva
or
aya
other
words
no
merely
male
creature
can
resist
that
corps
de
ballet
seems
to
have
been
chosen
exclusively
from
the
winners
of
beauty
contests
oops
skip
it
qualities
alone
however
would
not
account
for
their
success
and
it
took
me
a
while
to
discover
the
crowning
virtue
that
completes
this
collective
personality
is
a
kind
of
friendliness
and
frankness
of
address
toward
the
audience
which
we
have
been
led
to
believe
was
peculiar
to
the
ballet
that
convention
of
ballet
whereby
the
girls
convey
the
idea
that
they
are
all
the
daughters
of
impoverished
driven
to
the
stage
out
of
filial
piety
is
totally
absent
from
the
is
all
the
more
remarkable
because
the
is
to
ballet
what
is
to
politics
obviously
at
least
some
things
have
changed
for
the
better
in
so
far
as
the
ballet
is
concerned
the
of
performance
would
be
a
change
for
the
better
anywhere
at
any
time
no
matter
who
had
had
the
role
before
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
you
ever
laid
eyes
on

her

a
feminine
suavity
lightness
sparkle

which
are
simply
incomparable

getting
the

for

tomorrow
night
for
invitation
to
the

said
feel
your
performance
as
one
of
the
greatest
artists
would
lend
distinction
to
the
entertainment
of
our
guests
good
many
seasons
been
looking
at
the
naughty
stuff
on
television
so
the
other
night
thought
ought
to
see
how
immorality
is
doing
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
in
movies
all
this
movies
are
next
television
shows
went
to
see
has
been
billed
as
a
towering
monument
to
immorality
the
sins
of
ancient
are
said
to
be
collected
into
this
film
all
the
did
a
surprise
to
me
that
fell
television
seems
as
harmless
as
a
tour
of
at
night
cannot
imagine
a
single
scene
that
done
in
a
far
naughtier
manner
on
every
week
believe
watchers
will
be
bored
has
none
of
the
senseless
brutality
or
sadism
of
the
average
in
week
out
there
is
more
sex
to
be
seen
in
is
more
decadence
on
are
more
obvious
nymphomaniacs
on
any
series
another
respect
television
viewers
will
feel
right
at
home
because
most
of
the
actors
are
unknowns
the
exception
of
and
the
credits
are
as
unfamiliar
as
find
on
the
of
the
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
a
wild
party
at
a
seaside
villa
should
have
looked
at
some
of
the
old
silent
films
where
they
really
had
parties
boasted
a
strip
tease
carried
as
far
as
a
black
slip
a
lady
drunk
on
her
hands
and
knees
who
carries
the
hero
around
on
her
back
while
he
throws
pillow
feathers
in
her
face
a
frigid
beauty

in

that

two
months

the
to
reconsider
the
question
of
the
timing
were
intense
discussions
in
the
inner
councils
of
the
about
the
advisability
of
an
early
meeting
not
because
the
international
climate
was
improving
but
precisely
because
it
was
deteriorating
alarmingly
on
tests
was
especially
concerned
about
the
deadlock
in
the
nuclear
test
ban
negotiations
at
deadlock
has
been
caused
by
the
new
demand
for
a
and
neutral
directorate
and
thus
a
veto
over
the
control
machinery
the
strong
pressures
have
been
building
up
for
a
resumption
of
tests
on
grounds
that
the
may
be
secretly
testing
was
less
troubled
by
that
possibility
than
by
the
belief
that
a
breakdown
or
even
continued
stalemate
would
mean
an
unchecked
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
to
other
countries
as
well
as
a
fatal
blow
to
any
hope
for
disarmament
was
reason
to
believe
that
was
also
concerned
about
a
possible
spread
of
nuclear
weapons
particularly
to
question
arose
as
to
whether
a
frank
discussion
of
that
danger
with
the
leader
had
not
become
urgent
appeared

to
apply
the
tripartite
veto
principle
to
the
executive
organs
of
all
international
bodies
including
the

the
for

convinced
that
insistence
on
the
demand
would
make
international
agreements
or
even
negotiations
impossible
in
and
also
suggested
the
advisability
of
an
early
summit
meeting
the
reaction
was
that
the
bitter
exchanges
with
over
and
the
conflict
in
had
dampened
prospects
for
a
meeting
the
same
time
there
was
increased
reason
for
a
quick
meeting
lest
the
leader
as
a
result
of
those
episodes
come
to
a
dangerously
erroneous
conclusion
about
the
ability
and
determination
to
resist
pressure
the
had
blundered
badly
and
created
the
impression
of
impotency
against
penetration
even
on
its
own
doorstep
the
picture
was
almost
equally
bad
willingness
to
accept
a
neutral
may
have
led
to
believe
that
other
areas
could
be
neutralized
on
terms
that
disagreement
about
military
intervention
in
despite
warnings
that
they
might
do
so
allowed
to
carry
out
with
impunity
a
series
of
military
and
diplomatic
moves
that
greatly
strengthened
the
forces
a
result
the
is
in
a
poor
bargaining
position
at
the
current
negotiations
on
and
and
other
nations
in
are
under
increased
pressure
the
light
of
those
events
there
appeared
to
be
a
real
danger
that
might
overreach
himself
reported
from
that
the
mood
was
cocky
and
aggressive
has
indicated
that
he
plans
new
moves
on
before
the
year
is
out
and
his
advisers
felt
that
the
time
might
have
come
to
warn
against
a
grave
miscalculation
in
areas
such
as
or
from
which
there
would
be
no
turning
back
was
in
the
midst
of
such
deliberations
that
on
made
new
inquiries
through
the
in
about
a
meeting
with
the
in
the
near
future
told
he
would
give
his
answer
by
after
consultation
with
the
response
from
and
was
favorable
arrangements
for
the
meeting
in
were
worked
out
in
a
final
exchange
between
and
last
week
at
the
insistence
of
the
the
simultaneous
announcements
issued
in
and
last
emphasized
the
informal
nature
of
the
meeting
announcement
said
and
understand
that
this
meeting
is
not
for
the
purpose
of
negotiating
or
reaching
agreement
on
the
major
international
problems
that
involve
the
interest
of
many
other
countries
meeting
will
however
afford
a
timely
and
convenient
opportunity
for
the
first
personal
contact
between
them
and
a
general
exchange
of
views
on
the
major
issues
which
affect
the
relationships
between
the
two
countries
outlook
meeting
will
bring
together
a
seasoned
veteran
of
the
cold
war
who
in
own
words
is
shrewd
tough
vigorous
and
confident
and
a
his
birthday
is
with
a
demonstrated
capacity
for
political
battle
but
little
experience
in
international
diplomacy
announcement
last
week
of
the
forthcoming
encounter
produced
strong
reactions
in
the
of
both
approval
and
disapproval
approval
did
not
arise
from
an
expectation
of
agreements
at
inclination
was
to
accept
the
statement
that
there
would
be
no
formal
negotiations
those
who
were
in
favor
of
the
meeting
felt
that
a
frank
exchange
between
the
two
men
and
an
opportunity
to
size
one
another
up
would
prove
salutary
is
known
to
rely
heavily
on
his
instincts
about
his
adversaries
and
to
be
a
shrewd
judge
of
men
feeling
was
that
he
would
sense
an
inner
core
of
toughness
and
determination
in
the
and
that
plain
talk
by
would
give
him
pause
from
the
personal
equation
another
reason
advanced
in
favor
of
the
meeting
was
that
too
often
in
the
past
the
appeared
to
have
been
dragged
reluctantly
to
the
summit
has
made
propaganda
capital
out
of
that
fact
and
in
the
end
got
his
summit
meeting
anyway
time
the
initiative
came
in
part
at
least
from
allies
consulted
was
also
the
fact
that
by
the
time
he
meets
the
will
have
completed
conversations
with
all
the
other
principal
leaders
he
will
be
in
a
position
to
disabuse
the
leader
of
any
notions
he
may
have
about
grave
disunity
there
was
a
wide
area
of
agreement
on
the
value
of
the
making
a
final
effort
in
the
summit
spotlight
for
a
nuclear
test
accord
is
no
single
issue
that
has
aroused
stronger
feelings
throughout
the
world
tests
are
to
be
resumed
the
argument
went
it
is
vital
that
the
make
plain
that
the
onus
belongs
to
the
of
the
meeting
was
based
largely
on
the
belief
that
the
timing
could
hardly
be
worse
and
it
was
argued
will
interpret
the
consent
to
the
meeting
as
further
evidence
of
weakness
perhaps
even
panic
and
is
certain
to
try
to
exploit
the
advantage
he
now
believes
he
holds
the
is
meeting
the
leader
at
a
time
when
the
has
still
not
decided
on
the
scope
of
firm
foreign
policy
commitments
question
was
raised
for
example
as
to
what
attitude
the
would
take
if
proposes
a
broad
neutral
belt
extending
from
to
the
are
so
my
biologist
friends
tell
me
mechanisms
of
adaptation
and
defense
that
are
just
too
complete
and
too
satisfactory
are
a
case
in
point
shell
which
served
the
strain
so
well
at
a
relatively
early
stage
in
the
evolutionary
scheme
tended
to
cancel
out
the
possibility
of
future
development
this
may
or
may
not
be
good
biology
it
does
aptly
illustrate
the
strength
and
the
weakness
of
higher
education
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
accomplishment
in
the
field
of
higher
education
is
most
impressive
our
brethren
never
cease
to
marvel
at
the
number
and
the
size
of
our
colleges
and
universities
deeper
wonder
is
how
this
miracle
was
accomplished
in
decades
rather
than
in
centuries
and
by
immigrant
minorities
at
that
way
of
explanation
we
ourselves
are
prone
to
imagine
that
this
achievement
stems
from
the
same
zeal
and
generosity
which
brought
the
parochial
school
system
into
existence
is
however
one
curious
discrepancy
in
this
broad
and
flattering
picture
the
educational
achievement
in
retrospect
we
may
indeed
see
it
as
a
unified
whole
extending
from
grade
school
to
university
the
simple
truth
is
that
higher
education
has
never
really
been
an
official
project
certainly
not
in
the
same
sense
that
the
establishment
of
a
parochial
school
system
has
been
a
matter
of
official
policy
encouragement
is
one
thing
but
the
test
is
the
allocation
of
diocesan
and
parochial
funds
have
responded
generously
to
and
appeals
for
the
support
necessary
to
create
parochial
schools
but
they
have
not
contributed
in
a
similar
fashion
to
the
establishment
of
institutions
of
higher
learning
have
not
done
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
such
appeals
have
hardly
ever
been
made
authorities
generally
have
not
regarded
this
as
their
direct
responsibility
of
this
may
be
understandable
enough
it
is
however
in
fact
difficult
to
see
how
diocesan
authorities
could
have
acted
otherwise
for
better
or
for
worse
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
most
colleges
do
not
owe
their
existence
to
general
support
but
rather
to
the
initiative
resourcefulness
and
sacrifices
of
individual
religious
communities
esprit
de
corps
has
been
the
protective
shell
which
has
made
the
achievement
possible
understand
the
past
history
and
the
future
potential
of
higher
education
it
is
necessary
to
appreciate
the
special
character
of
the
esprit
de
corps
of
the
religious
community
is
something
more
than
the
arithmetical
sum
of
individual
totals
of
piety
and
detachment
religious
community
with
a
vital
sense
of
mission
achieves
a
degree
of
group
orientation
and
group
identification
seldom
found
elsewhere
fact
that
the
group
orientation
and
group
identification
are
founded
on
supernatural
principles
and
nourished
by
the
of
devotion
simply
give
them
a
deeper
and
more
satisfying
dimension
net
result
is
a
uniquely
satisfying
sense
of
comradeship
the
kind
of
comradeship
which
sparks
enthusiasm
and
blunts
the
cutting
edge
of
sacrifice
and
hardship
colleges
and
universities
are
in
a
very
real
sense
the
product
of
private
enterprise
the
private
enterprise
of
religious
communities
it
not
been
for
such
private
enterprise
diocesan
authorities
might
of
course
have
been
goaded
into
establishing
institutions
subsidized
by
diocesan
funds
and
parish
collections
and
staffed
by
religious
as
paid
employees
is
however
no
point
in
speculating
about
such
a
possibility
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
owe
their
existence
to
a
spirit
not
unlike
that
which
produces
the
family
business
spirit
is
the
real
explanation
of
the
marvel
of
our
achievement
is
this
spirit
which
explains
some
of
the
anomalies
of
higher
education
in
particular
the
wasteful
duplication
apparent
in
some
areas
think
for
example
of
three
colleges
with
pitifully
small
enrollments
clustered
within
a
few
miles
of
a
major
university
which
is
also
is
not
an
isolated
example
this
aspect
of
the
total
picture
has
been
commented
upon
often
enough
would
seem
to
represent
esprit
de
corps
run
riot
however
from
the
question
of
wasteful
duplication
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
family
business
spirit
in
higher
education
which
deserves
closer
scrutiny
while
the
past
needs
of
the
in
this
country
may
have
been
adequately
met
by
collegiate
institutions
which
in
temper
and
tone
closely
resembled
junior
colleges
and
finishing
schools
it
would
seem
that
need
is
for
the
college
which
more
closely
resembles
the
university
in
its
pursuit
of
excellence
the
earlier
excellence
stage
of
education
the
operation
could
be
conducted
on
an
community
basis
with
demand
for
professional
qualifications
and
specialized
training
the
need
for
outsiders
becomes
more
pressing
problem
is
not
merely
that
more
outside
teachers
are
needed
but
that
a
different
brand
is
called
for
on
the
earlier
stage
the
of
the
of
in
a
recent
report
on
the
question
of
faculty
participation
in
administrative
noted
that
the
term
as
opposed
to
maintenance
employee
was
a
not
inapt
description
however
the
outsider
is
likely
to
have
professional
qualifications
of
the
highest
order
otherwise
the
college
would
not
be
interested
in
hiring
him
and
to
be
acclimatized
to
the
democratic
processes
of
the
secular
or
state
university
while
no
one
expects
total
democracy
on
the
academic
scene
the
scholar
will
be
particularly
sensitive
to
a
line
between
first
and
second
class
citizenship
drawn
on
any
basis
other
than
that
of
academic
rank
or
professional
achievement
the
above
mentioned
report
of
the
of
the
of
the
basic
outlook
of
the
new
breed
of
lay
faculty
emerges
very
clearly
in
the
very
statement
of
the
problem
as
the
members
see
it
with
the
best
of
intentions
he
the
of
the
university
is
loath
to
delegate
such
authority
and
responsibility
to
a
group
the
membership
of
which
considered
as
it
must
be
by
him
in
individual
terms
is
inhomogeneous
mortal
and
of
extremely
varying
temperament
interests
and
capabilities
is
natural
that
he
should
turn
for
his
major
support
to
a
select
and
dedicated
few
from
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
and
whose
goals
are
in
their
opinion
identified
with
its
highest
good
and
to
use
that
phrase
the
attainment
of
excellence
pattern
here
pictured
is
clearly
not
peculiar
to
it
is
simply
that
the
paradox
involved
in
this
kind
of
control
of
the
institution
by
the
organization
which
actually
owns
it
becomes
more
obvious
where
there
is
a
larger
and
more
distinguished
outside
faculty
is
particularly
interesting
that
those
who
framed
the
report
should
refer
to
the
organization
which
actually
owns
the
university
this
seems
to
show
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
there
is
more
to
the
problem
than
the
ordinary
issue
of
tension
in
any
case
one
does
not
have
to
read
very
closely
between
the
lines
to
realize
that
the
situation
is
not
regarded
as
a
particularly
happy
one
faculty
members
want
to
be
considered
partners
in
the
academic
enterprise
and
not
merely
paid
employees
of
a
family
business
are
two
reasons
why
failure
to
come
to
grips
with
this
demand
could
be
fatal
to
the
future
of
the
university
the
first
place
there
is
the
obvious
problem
of
recruiting
high
caliber
personnel
spreads
rapidly
in
the
tightly
knit
academic
profession
much
given
to
attending
meetings
and
conferences
of
even
dissatisfaction
by
a
college
faculty
member
has
the
effect
of
confirming
the
already
existing
stereotype
the
academic
world
there
is
seldom
anything
so
dramatic
as
a
strike
or
a
boycott
all
that
happens
is
that
the
better
qualified
teacher
declines
to
gamble
two
or
three
years
of
his
life
on
the
chance
that
conditions
at
the
institution
will
be
as
good
as
those
elsewhere
appreciate
the
nature
of
the
gamble
it
should
be
realized
that
while
college
teaching
is
almost
a
public
symbol
of
security
that
security
does
not
come
as
quickly
or
as
automatically
as
it
does
in
an
elementary
school
system
or
in
the
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
major
institutions
now
guarantee
firm
tenure
is
a
significant
advance
but
its
import
should
not
be
exaggerated
a
man
invests
a
block
of
his
years
at
a
university
without
gaining
the
coveted
promotion
not
only
is
he
faced
with
the
problem
of
starting
over
but
there
is
also
a
certain
depreciation
in
the
market
value
of
his
services
man
does
not
make
that
kind
of
gamble
if
he
suspects
that
one
or
more
of
the
limited
number
of
tenure
positions
is
being
reserved
for
members
of
the
family
as
it
is
possible
to
exaggerate
the
drawing
power
of
the
new
tenure
practices
it
is
also
possible
to
exaggerate
the
significance
of
the
now
relatively
adequate
salaries
paid
by
major
institutions
compensation
is
indispensable
adequate
compensation
and
particularly
merely
adequate
compensation
is
no
substitute
for
those
intangibles
which
cause
a
man
to
sacrifice
part
of
his
earning
potential
by
taking
up
college
teaching
in
the
first
place
speaking
the
total
atmosphere
is
such
an
intangible
but
the
larger
demand
is
for
a
sense
of
creative
participation
and
mature
responsibility
in
the
total
work
of
the
university
who
derive
their
own
sense
of
purpose
through
identification
with
the
religious
community
rather
than
the
academic
community
are
prone
to
underestimate
both
the
reservoir
of
idealism
and
his
need
for
this
identification
is
no
need
here
to
spell
out
the
conditions
of
creative
teaching
except
to
point
out
that
at
the
college
level
the
sense
of
community
and
of
community
responsibility
is
even
more
necessary
than
it
is
at
other
levels
college
teacher
needs
the
stimulus
of
communication
with
other
faculty
members
but
he
also
needs
to
feel
that
such
communication
even
informal
debates
over
the
luncheon
table
are
a
contribution
to
the
total
good
of
the
institution
this
in
turn
means
that
decisions
are
not
merely
imposed
from
the
top
but
that
there
be
some
actual
mechanism
of
faculty
participation
second
reason
for
being
concerned
with
the
dichotomy
between
faculty
members
who
are
part
of
the
that
owns
and
operates
the
institution
and
those
who
are
merely
paid
employees
is
therefore
the
baneful
effect
on
the
caliber
of
the
teaching
itself
is
a
problem
that
goes
considerably
beyond
questions
of
salary
and
tenure
though
it
may
seem
difficult
to
envision
any
definitive
resolution
of
the
problem
of
ownership
and
control
there
are
nevertheless
certain
suggestions
which
seem
to
be
in
order
first
is
a
negative
warning
there
is
no
point
in
the
creation
of
faculty
committees
and
advisory
boards
with
titles
but
no
real
authority
the
case
of
academic
personnel
the
feeling
of
participation
can
hardly
be
faked
teachers
are
well
versed
in
the
technique
of
leading

it

by

clear
that

what

the

reference

to
the
fact
that

reduced
to

itself
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
this
form
of

the
only
difficulty
on
the

is
that
those
faculty

who
are
in
a

to
implement

members
of
the

under

more
the
fallacious
equation
is
advanced
to
argue
that
since
business
is
restricted
under
the
laws
there
must
be
a
corresponding
restriction
against
labor
unions
the
law
must
treat
everybody
equally
in

its
majestic
equality
must
forbid
the

as
the

sleeping

public
atmosphere
that
has
been
generated
which
makes
acceptance
of
this
law
a
possibility
stems
from
the
disrepute
into
which
the
labor
movement
has
fallen
as
a
result
of
hearings
into
corruption
in
relations
and
later
into
the
jurisdictional
squabbles
that
plagued
industrial
relations

of
what

provoked
his
indignation
on
behalf
of
the
taxpayer
who
was
footing
the
bill
is
now
disclosed
that
the
taxpayer
not
only
pays
for
high
wages
but
he
pays
the
strike
expenses
when
the
latter
undertakes
to
fight
a

that
the

this
problem
to
the
attention
of
the

unresponsive
has
nor
been
heard
from
on
the
matter
they
are
preoccupied
with
ending
labor
abuses
by
extending
the
laws
to
the
unions
recent
publicity
attending
the
successful
federal
prosecution
of
a
conspiracy
indictment
against
a
number
of
electrical
manufacturers
has
evoked
a
new
respect
for
the
laws
that
is
justified
neither
by
their
rationale
nor
by
the
results
they
have
obtained
laws
inform
a
business
that
it
must
compete
but
along
completely
undefined
lines
it
must
play
a
game
in
which
there
never
is
a
winner
fact
is
that
any
business
that
wants
to
operate
successfully
cannot
follow
the
law
thus
becomes
the
answer
to
a
foolish
public
policy
us
look
at
the
industry
in
which
and
a
number
of
other
manufacturers
were
recently
convicted
of
engaging
in
a
conspiracy
to
rig
prices
and
allocate
the
market
industry
is
so
structured
that
by
a
company
will
vary
with
the
way
overhead
charges
are
allocated
whether
marginal
or
average
pricing
is
applied
problem
becomes
even
more
complex
where
an
enterprise
is
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
a
wide
variety
of
other
goods
in
addition
to
the
heavy
electrical
equipment
procedures
can
be
varied
to
provide
a
rationale
for
almost
any
price
enterprises
of
the
size
of
are
in
a
position
to
structure
their
prices
in
such
a
way
that
the
relatively
small
competitors
can
be
forced
to
the
wall
in
a
very
short
time
these
giants
really
flex
their
competitive
muscles
they
would
become
the
only
survivors
in
the
industry
would
then
accuse
them
of
creating
a
monopoly
by
unfair
competition
if
they
show
they
get
the
orders
the
circumstances
the
only
protection
for
the
relatively
small
manufacturers
is
to
engage
in
exactly
the
kind
of
conspiracy
with
the
giants
for
which
the
latter
were
convicted
in
such
a
conspiracy
was
an
act
of
mercy
by
the
giants
paradox
implicit
in
the
whole
affair
is
shown
by
the
demand
of
the
government
after
the
conviction
that
sign
a
consent
decree
that
it
would
not
reduce
prices
so
low
as
to
compete
seriously
with
its
fellows
other
words
the
laws
designed
to
reduce
prices
to
the
consumer
on
and
become
a
tool
to
protect
the
marginal
manufacturer
on
and
which
theory
would
govern
the
enforcers
of
the
law
on
question
might
be
asked
the
managements
of
the
manufacturers
know
these
facts
did
they
engage
in
a
flood
of
mea
culpas
throw
a
few
scapegoats
to
the
dogs
and
promise
to
be
good
boys
thereafter
expressing
their
complete
confidence
in
the
laws
past
usefulness
of
the
laws
to
management
was
explained
by
in
of
back
in
wrote
the
laws
were
the
answer
of
a
society
which
unconsciously
felt
the
need
of
great
organizations
and
at
the
same
time
had
to
deny
them
a
place
in
the
moral
and
logical
ideology
of
the
social
structure
laws
became
the
greatest
protection
to
uncontrolled
business
dictatorship
when
corporate
abuses
were
attacked
it
was
done
on
the
theory
that
criminal
penalties
would
be
invoked
rather
than
control
this
manner
every
scheme
for
direct
control
broke
to
pieces
on
the
great
protective
rock
of
the
laws
in
any
event
it
is
obvious
that
the

did
not
prevent
the
formation
of
some
of
the
greatest
financial

some
of

most

the
fundamental

that

for
this
untrammeled
license
penalties
handed
out
in
the
electrical

which
included

were
unprecedented
in

perhaps
because
the
conspirators
had
displayed
unusual
ineptness
in
their
pricing

a

needed
for
the

of

fictitious
impersonal

quite
obviously
some
method
must

secret
conspiracy
of

is
hardly
such
a
vehicle
one
can
argue
that
no
such
control
is
necessary
as
long
as
one
pretends
that
the
laws
are
effective
and
rational
clearly
the
laws
are
neither
effective
nor
rational
and
yet
the
argument
goes
that
they
should
be
extended
to
the
labor
union
who
favor
placing
trade
unions
under
laws
imply
that
they
are
advocating
a
brand
new
reform
individuals
who
opposed
trade
unions
and
collective

said
so
in
plain
acceptance
of
collective
bargaining
as
a
national
policy
in
implicit
in
the
writing
of
of
the
has
made
it
impolitic
to
oppose
collective
bargaining
in
principle
the
and
the
all
endorse
the
principle
of
collective
bargaining
basic
purpose
of
an
effective
system
is
the
removal
of
wages
from
competition
a
union
cannot
perform
this
function
then
collective
bargaining
is
being
palmed
off
by
organizers
as
a
gigantic
fraud
tortured
reasoning
that
unions
use
to
deny
their
ambition
to
exercise
monopoly
power
over
the
supply
and
price
of
labor
is
one
of
the
things
that
create
a
legal
profession
problem
must
be
faced
squarely
laborers
are
merely
commodities
competing
against
each
other
in
a
market
place
like
so
many
bags
of
wheat
and
corn
unsupported
by
the
way
by
any
agricultural
subsidy
then
they
may
be
pardoned
for
reacting
with
complete
antagonism
to
a
system
that
imposes
such
status
upon

labor

our
common
law

outlawed

its
branches
into

no
pious
hypocrisies

about
being

against

the
opinion
of
the
employers

officious

improper

the
subject
the
price
of

be
regulated

the
demand

the
eventual
winner

in
all
his
years
he
never
spent
a
more
harrowing
afternoon
as
he
waited
for
the
victory
to
drop
in
his
lap
the
defending
champion
lost
his
title
on
the
hole
after
a
few
minutes
of
misfortune
that
left
even
his
fellow

gaping
in
disbelief

you
have
it
licked

get
up

afternoon
midway
through

just
what

on
the
last
few
holes
got
up
and
bit
both
and
was
the
first
to
feel
its
teeth
playing
a
splendid
first
nine
holes
in
two
strokes
under
par
on
this
fifth
and
final
day
of
the
tournament
fourth
round
had
been
washed
out
by
a
violent
rainstorm
when
it
was
only
half
completed
game
rapidly
fell
to
pieces
bogeyed

journey
through
woods
and

the
bogeyed

through
the
last
three
holes
without
further
mishap
for

signed
his
scorecard

walked
off

almost
in

leading
him
by
a
stroke
had
started
the
round
four
strokes
behind
and
at
one
point
in
the
afternoon
had
trailed
by
as
many
as
six
strokes
all
he
had
to
do
was
finish
in
even
par
to
collect
the
trophy
and
the
biggest
single
paycheck
in
golf
hit
a
good
straight
drive
up
the
fairway
on
the
hole
he
seemed
to
have
the
championship
won
the
shot
he
used
to
approach
the
green
strayed
into
a
bunker
and
lodged
in
a
slight
depression
trying
to
hit
it
out
with
a
sand
wedge
bounced
the
ball
over
the
green
past
spectators
and
down
the
slope
toward
a
tower
told
his
partner
that
he
simply
played
the
hole
too
fast
did
seem
hasty
on
his
second
and
third
shots
but
then
there
was
an
agonizing
wait
of
several
minutes
while
graciously
putted
out
giving
a
chance
to
recover
his
composure
which
he
had
quite
visibly
lost
the
shaken
finally
did
hit
his
fourth
shot
he
overshot
the
hole
by
feet
was
now
putting
merely
for
a
tie
and
who
was
sitting
beside
his
wife
and
watching
it
all
on
television
in
clubhouse
apartment
stared
in
amazement
when
missed
the
putt
for
the
four
rounds
at
was
a
comfortable
four
strokes
ahead
of
the
next
closest
pro
but
it
was
barely
good
enough
for
a
tie
with
lean
and
leathery
amateur
who
has
been
playing
topnotch
tournament
golf
for
many
years
refused
to
let
the
jitters
overtake
him
and
closed
the
tournament
with
his
second
straight
at
seven
late
last
afternoon
had
played
seven
consecutive
rounds
of
golf
at
the
four
last

ever
being
out

finished
his
round
with
a
disappointing
this
remarkable
record
was
still
intact
thanks
to
his
and
rounds
of

total
of

three
strokes
better
than
the
next
best
score
a
by
the
tall
and
deliberate
who
had
been
playing
very
well
all
winter
long
knew
as
did
everybody
else
at
that
his
streak
was
about
to
be
broken
an
hour
after
he
finished
his
round
holed
out
at
the
green
with
a
and
a
total
of
four
strokes
ahead
of
than
a
streak
had
ended
after
the
erratic
climate
and
the
final
round
on
have
become
meteorological
footnotes
the
will
be
remembered
as
the
scene
of
the
mano
a
mano
between
and
most
such
sports
rivalries
it
appeared
to
have
developed
almost
spontaneously
although
this
was
not
exactly
the
case
the
winter
tour
began
at
last
there
was
no
one
in
sight
to
challenge
towering
prestige
if
to
confirm
his
stature
he
quickly
won
three
of
the
first
eight
tournaments
won
only
one
as
the
tour
reached
a
month
ago
was
leading
in
official
winnings
by
a
few
hundred
dollars
and
the
rest
of
the
field
was
somewhere
off
in
nowhere
the
final
round
at
the
luck
of
the
draw
paired
and
in
the
same
threesome
and
although
it
was
far
from
obvious
at
the
time
the
gallery
was
treated
to
the
first
chapter
of
what
promises
to
be
one
of
the
most
exciting
duels
in
sport
for
a
long
time
to
come
that
final
at
neither
nor
was
leading
the
tournament
and
as
it
turned
out
neither
won
it
whichever
of
these
two
finished
ahead
of
the
other
would
be
the
undisputed
financial
leader
of
the
tour
immediately
proved
he
was
not
in
the
least
awed
by
the
dramatic
proximity
of
outplayed
all
around
the
course
and
finished
with
a
tremendous
to
until
the
gradually
increased
his
lead
over
in
winnings
and
added
one
more
tournament
victory
at
they
reached
last
week
together
they
had
won
five
of
the
tournaments
to
date
rivalry
the
first
day
of
the
the
contest
between
and
developed
instantly
was
a
dismal
drizzly
day
but
a
good
one
on
which
to
score
over
the
course
usually
skiddy
greens
were
moist
and
soft
so
the
golfers
were
able
to
strike
their
approach
shots
boldly
at
the
and
putt
firmly
toward
the
hole
without
too
much
worry
about
the
consequences
got
him
off
to
an
early
lead
which
he
shared
with
was
only
one
stroke
back
with
a
so
it
was
still
not
clear
to
many
in
the
enormous
horde
of
spectators
unquestionably
the
largest
golf
crowd
ever
that
this
tournament
was
to
be
essentially
a
match
between
and
lot
of
people
were
still
thinking
about
the
spectacular
young
amateur
who
had
a
or
who
had
a
somewhat
shaky
but
was
bound
to
do
better
or
whose
accurate
short
game
and
supersensitive
putter
can
overcome
so
many
of
treacheries
or
even
old
whose
excellent
made
one
wonder
if
he
had
solved
the
geriatric
aspects
of
golf
nobody
except
was
thinking
of
a
day
as
cloudless
and
lovely
as
had
been
gray
and
ugly
the
plot
of
the
tournament
came
clearly
into
focus
had
started
early
in
the
day
and
by
the
time
and
were
on
the
course
separated
as
they
were
destined
to
be
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
by
about
half
an
hour
they
could
see
on
the
numerous
scoreboards
spotted
around
the
course
that
who
ended
with
a
was
not
having
a
good
day
began
his
second
round
in
a
twosome
with
amateur
his
share
of
the
gallery
was
not
conspicuously
large
for
a
contender
began
with
a
birdie
on
the
first
hole
added
five
straight
pars
and
then
another
birdie
at
the
the
back
nine
he
began
to
acquire
the
tidal
wave
of
a
gallery
that
stayed
with
him
the
rest
of
the
tournament
birdied
the
the
and
the
five
birdies
one
bogey
and
pars
for
a
half
an
hour
behind
in
company
with
birdied
the
the
the
and
the
four
birdies
one
bogey
and
pars
for
a
roar
of
gallery
as
he
sank
a
thrilling
putt
would
roll
out
across
the
parklike
landscape
of
only
to
be
answered
moments
later
by
the
roar
of
gallery
for
a
similar
triumph
one
point
late
in
the
day
when
was
lining
up
a
putt
on
the
a
thunderous
cheer
from
the
direction
of
the
green
unmistakably
announced
that
had
birdied
the
final
hole
so
much
as
a
grimace
or
a
gesture
to
show
that
he
had
noticed
although
he
later
admitted
that
he
had
proceeded
to
sink
his
and
his
gallery
sent
its
explosive
vocalization
rolling
back
along
the
intervening
fairways
in
reply
boldness
of
champions
who
now
doubted
that
a
personal
duel
was
under
way
had
only
to
watch
how
these
exceptionally
gifted
golfers
were
playing
this
most
difficult
golf
course
is
almost
axiomatic
that
golfers
who
dominate
the
game
of
golf
for
any
period
of
time
attack
their
shots
with
a
vehemence
bordering
on
violence
bad
luck
that
can
so
often
mar
a
round
of
golf
is
simply
overpowered
and
obliterated
by
the
contemptuous
boldness
of
these
champions
played
that
way
did
did
last
week
at
the
and
did
the
third
round
of
the
tournament
began
on
and
the
duel
was
resumed
in
earnest
it
was
superior
aggressiveness
that
carried
him
into
the
lead
day
had
started
first
stepped
on
the
first
tee
he
knew
that
had
birdied
the
first
two
holes
and
already
was
under
par
for
the
day
immediately
proceeded
to
follow
suit
fact
he
went
on
to
birdie
the
and
as
well
to
go
under
par
for
the
first
eight
holes
real
test
came
on
the
ninth
hole
a
downhill
dogleg
to
the
left
measuring
yards
hit
a
poor
tee
shot
pulling
it
off
into
the
pine
woods
separating
the
and
first
fairways
hit
one
of
the
trees
the
ball
came
to
rest
not
more
than
yards
out
then
had
the
choice
of
punching
the
ball
safely
out
of
the
woods
to
the
fairway
and
settling
for
a
bogey
or
gambling
latter
involved
hitting
a
full
out
to
the
first
fairway
and
toward
the
clubhouse
hoping
to
slice
it
back
to
the
deeply
bunkered
green
was
hitting
the
ball
well
said
later
and
felt
strong
playing
like
that
better
attack
attacked
with
his
and
hit
a
shot
that
few
who
saw
it
will
ever
forget
struck
the
green
on
the
fly
and
stopped
just
off
the
edge
there
he
chipped
back
and
sank
his
putt
for
a
par
meanwhile
had
been
having
his
troubles
started
on
the
hole
a
this
day
the
wind
had
switched
from
the
northwest
to
the
southeast
and
nearly
every
shot
on
the
course
was
different
from
the
previous
few
days
the
tee
chose
to
hit
a
when
a
was
the
proper
club
so
he
put
the
ball
in
a
bunker
in
front
of
the
green
bogey
on
this
hole
and
subsequent
bogeys
at
and
along
with
a
birdie
at
brought
him
back
to
even
par

second
nine
was
already
four
strokes
behind

it

three
more

do
you

home
reporter
asked
recently
tell
you
the
truth
said
talk
much
is
no
surprising
trait
for
a
ballplayer
is
surprising
and
pleasant
is
that
and
under
constant
pressure
from
writers
and
photographers
are
trying
to
be
cooperative
the
two
is
by
nature
the
less
outgoing
the
more
outspoken
last
week
when
a
reporter
was
standing
near
locker
walked
up
and
volunteered
an
anecdote
that
kid
said
pointing
to
a
boy
never
forget
one
time
struck
out
three
times
dropped
a
fly
ball
and
we
lost
the
game
came
back
sitting
by
my
locker
feeling
real
low
and
the
kid
walks
over
to
me
looks
up
and
says
stunk
in
talking
to
reporters
tries
to
answer
all
questions
candidly
and
fully
but
on
rare
occasions
he
shuns
newsmen
made
a
dumb
play
he
says
want
to
talk
to
anyone
angry
his
own
confession
is
an
angry
young
man
at
in
he
told
manager
play
for
you
me
where
can
play
sent
him
to
at
in
he
told
manager
not
learning
anything
on
the
bench
me
did
and
led
the
team
to
victory
in
the
the
way
am
he
says
tell
people
what
think
a
good
ballplayer
got
to
get
mad
me
a
team
of
nine
angry
men
and
give
you
a
team
of
nine
gentlemen
and
beat
you
nine
out
of
ten
times
idols
good
indication
of
the
two
personalities
is
the
way
they
reacted
to
meeting
their
own
heroes
was
was
a
kid
told
a
sportswriter
last
week
used
to
follow
every
day
in
the
box
score
just
to
see
whether
he
got
a
hit
or
not
you
came
up
to
the
majors
did
you
seek
out
for
advice
you
kidding
afraid
to
talk
to
a
guy
you
idolize
hero
was
went
to
the
says
an
pitcher
who
sells
mutual
funds
in
still
was
playing
and
every
day
would
go
by
his
locker
just
aching
for
some
word
of
encouragement
from
this
great
man
this
hero
of
his
never
said
a
word
crushed
told
me
he
vowed
right
then
that
if
he
ever
got
to
be
a
star
this
never
would
be
said
of
him
has
kept
the
vow
all
the
he
is
the
veteran
most
friendly
to
rookies
nor
is
totally
devoted

baseball

all
else

railroading

mining
are
not
the
highest
paid
arts
and
concentrate
on
baseball

to
play
baseball
the
best
they
can
is
a
complete
ballplayer
beyond
any
question
can
do
more
things
well
of
the
reasons
they
get
along
fine
says
a
sportswriter
who
is
friendly
with
the
two
men
is
that
both
realize

an
immediate
advantage

only
both

it

other

actions
which

for

there

in

than
political
parties

approximately
eight
for

were
four
principal
ones
there
were
those
among

who
favored
splitting
the
country
into
small
independent
states
it
there
were
those
who
favored
a
loose
federalism
having
a
central
government
of
limited
authority
with
much
power
residing
in
the
states
there
were
those
notably
who
favored
a
unified
with
a
very
strong
central
government
fourth
there
were
moderates
who
were
in
no

for
independence

wished
to
wait
until
the

up
the
positions
of
all
parties
and
leaders
were
constantly
shifting
final
factor
which
contributed
greatly
to
the
fragmentation
of
the

after

was
the
provincial
structure
that
had
been
established
by
the
for
convenience
in

had
divided
the
into
six
provinces
and
unfortunately
with
little
regard
for
ethnic
groupings
some
provinces
contained
tribes
which
detested
each
other

to
them
independence
meant
an
opportunity
for
war
was
granted
its
independence
with
what
seemed
a
workable
form
of
government
there
were
to
be
a
president

a

a
bicameral
legislature
elected
by
universal
suffrage

will
try

get
agreement
among
the

countries
to
take
more
textile
imports
from
the
countries
over
the

that
developing

to
get
on

they

grow
larger
than
it
otherwise
would
is
to
let
these
countries
earn
their
way
as
much
as
possible
the
same
time
another
purpose
of
the
conference
will
be
to
get
certain
countries
to
control
textile
exports
especially
dumping
of
specific
products
to
countries
since
has
been
voluntarily
curbing
exports
of
textiles
to
the
and
have
been
limiting
exports
of
certain
types
of
textiles
to
for
several
years
under
the
of
these
countries
is
happy
with
these
arrangements
want
to
increase
exports
to
the
they
have
been
curbing
shipments
they
have
watched
step
in
and
capture
an
expanding
share
of
the
big
market
interests
loudly
protest
limiting
their
exports
to
while
and
textiles
pour
into
market
unrestrictedly
and
are
chafing
under
similar
restrictions
on
the
market
for
similar
reasons
hope
is
that
at
the
conference
or
through
bilateral
talks
the
countries
in
and
will
see
that
dumping
practices
cause
friction
all
around
and
may
result
in

expansion
of
the

trade

what

point
the
way

this

in

plight
of
a

library
is
proportionately
worse
with
this
situation
most
libraries
either
endure
the
severe
limitations
of
their
budgets
and
do
what
they
can
with
what
they
have
or
else
depend
on
the
bounty
of
patrons
and
local
governments
to
supplement
their
annual
funds
some
parts
of
the
country
however
a
movement
has
begun
to
grow
under
the
wing
of
state
governments
whereby
with
the
financial
help
of
the
state
libraries
share
their

resources

a
or
regional
basis
has
what
is
probably
the
most
advanced
of
these
systems
so
well
developed
that
it
has
become
a
model
for
others
to
follow
it
is
so
large
a
state
with
marked
contrasts
in
population
density
the
organization
of
the
offers
a
of
how
the
plan
works
one
extreme
are
the
systems
of
upper
where
libraries
in
two
or
more
counties
combine
to
serve
a
large
sparsely
populated
area
the
other
are
organizations
like
the
newly
formed
in
a
area
with
ample
resources
and
a
rapidly
growing
territory
to
serve
these
types
and
those
in
between
are
in
existence
by
reason
of
a
legislative
interest
in
libraries
that
began
at
as
early
as
with
the
creation
by
the
legislature
of
county
library
systems
financed
by
county
governments
with
matching
funds
from
the
state
was
a
step
in
the
right
direction
but
it
took
an
additional
act
passed
in
to
establish
fully
the
thriving
systems
of
today
this
law
annual
grants
are
given
to
systems
in
substantial
amounts
earlier
difficulty
was
overcome
by
making
it
clear
that
individual
libraries
in
any
area
might
join
or
not
as
they
saw
fit
library
boards
are
wary
of
the
plan
large
library
surrounded
in
a
county
by
smaller
ones
may
feel
that
the
demands
on
its
resources
are
likely
to
be
too
great
small
library
may
cherish
its
independence
and
established
ways
and
resist
joining
in
a
cooperative
movement
that
sometimes
seems
radical
to
older
members
of
the
board
a
system
however
the
autonomy
of
each
member
library
is
preserved
local
community
maintains
responsibility
for
the
financial
support
of
its
own
library
program

and

but
wider
resources
and
additional

become
available
through

in

the

the

libraries
find
too
that
the

saves
tax

that

until

wake

the

fantastically
from

it

perhaps

grounds
that

not

was
based
on

which
said
that
the
telegraphers
had
secured
an
agreement
whereby
they
were
guaranteed
pay
per

whether
they
worked

not
and
that
a
reduction
in
their
number
was
limited
to
per

comment
was
that
this
was
featherbedding
in
its
ultimate
form
and
that
sympathy
for
the
railroad
was
misplaced
since
it
had
entered
into

an

statement
was
also
made
that
undoubtedly
the
railroad
had
received
some
compensating
benefit
from
the
telegraphers

that
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
what
could
balance

job
for

supplied
to
us

that
the
railroad
gained

in

the
key
fact
emerging

only
a
little
in

but
it
was
enough
to
lose
the
absolute

it

enjoyed
since

to
form

it
must
deal
with
one
of
the
two

some

the

question
left

is
whether

could
go
either

the

before

are
a
nation
of
joiners
a
quality
which
our
friends
find
endearing
and
sometimes
amusing
it
can
be
dangerous
if
the
joiner
want
to
make
a
spectacle
of
himself
instance
conservative
organizations
some
of
them
secret
are
sprouting
in
the
garden
of
joining
where
liberal
organizations
once
took
root
specific
example
is
a
secret
fraternity
which
will
coordinate
efforts
principle
is
commendable
but
we
suspect
that
in
the
practice
somebody
is
going
to
get
gulled
to
of
has
devised
a
series
of
questions
which
the
joiner
might
well
ask
about
any
organization
seeking
his
money
and
his
name
it
assail
schools
and
churches
with
blanket
accusations
it
attack
other
traditional
institutions
with
unsupportable
and
wild
charges
it
put
the
label
of
or
subversive
on
everyone
with
whom
it
disagrees
politically
it
attempt
to
rewrite
modern
history
by
blaming
statesmen
for
wars
depression
and
other
troubles
of
the
world
it
employ
crude
pressure
tactics
with
such
means
as
anonymous
telephone
calls
and
letter
writing
campaigns
its
spokesmen
seem
more
interested
in
the
amount
of
money
they
collect
than
in
the
principles
they
purport
to
advocate
some
instances
a
seventh
question
can
be
added
the
organization
show
an
affinity
for
a
foreign
government
political
party
or
personality
in
opposition
or
preference
to
the
system
the
joiner
asks
these
questions
he
is
not
likely
to
be
duped
by
extremists
who
are
seeking
to
capitalize
on
the
confusions
and
the
patriotic
apprehensions
of
in
a
troubled
time
somewhere
in
a
category
between
theory
and
sand
fleas
difficult
to
see
but
undeniably
there
nevertheless
is
the
tropical
green
city
of
a
string
of
offshore
islands
that
has
almost
no
residents
limited
access
and
an
unlimited
future
latter
is
what
concerns
us
all
land
you
can
see
here
from
the
tip
end
of
looking
southward
belongs
to
someone
people
who
have
title
to
the
land
what
you
see
the
land
underneath
the
water
belongs
to
someone
too
public
only
real
problem
is
to
devise
a
plan
whereby
the
owners
of
the
land
can
develop
their
property
without
the
public
losing
its
underwater
land
and
the
right
to
its
development
for
public
use
and
enjoyment
the
fairly
brief
but
hectic
history
of
the
developers
of
waterfront
land
have
too
often
wound
up
with
both
their
land
and
ours
this
instance
happily
insistence
is
being
made
that
our
share
is
protected
until
this
protection
is
at
least
as
concrete
as
say
the
row
of
hotels
that
bars
us
from
our
own
sands
at
those
who
represent
us
all
should
agree
to
nothing
doors

reaction
of
certain
members
to
newest
laws
was
as
dismaying
as
it
was
disappointing
had
assumed
that
at
least
this
local
legislative
body
had
nothing
to
hide
and
therefore
had
no
objections
to
making
the
deliberations
of
its
committees
and
the
city
commissions
available
to
the
public
the
preamble
to
the
statutes
collectively
known
as
the
the
declares
that
the
public
commissions
boards
and
councils
and
other
public
agencies
in
this
state
exist
to
aid
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
is
the
intent
of
the
law
that
their
actions
be
taken
openly
and
that
their
deliberations
be
conducted
openly
people
of
this
state
do
not
yield
their
sovereignty
to
the
agencies
that
serve
them
people
in
delegating
authority
do
not
give
their
public
servants
the
right
to
decide
what
is
good
for
the
people
to
know
and
what
is
not
good
for
them
to
know
full
implementation
of
these
noble
words
however
has
taken
the
efforts
of
five
sessions
of
the
has
led
the
nation
in
enacting
guarantees
that
public
business
shall
be
publicly
conducted
but
not
until
this
year
did
the
lawmakers
in
plug
the
remaining
loopholes
in
the
the
lip
service
paid
by
local
governments
the
statutes
have
been
continuously
subverted
by
reservations
and
rationalizations
all
else
fails
it
is
argued
that
open
sessions
slow
down
governmental
operations
submit
that
this
is
a
most
desirable
effect
of
the
law
and
one
of
its
principal
aims
public
scrutiny
the
deliberations
of
public
agencies
would
no
doubt
be
conducted
more
speedily
the
citizens
would
of
course
never
be
sure
that
the
decisions
that
resulted
were
as
correct
as
they
were
expeditious
when
needed

the

the

has
faced
course
it
is
the
decision
goes
wrong
it
may
be
as
fears
the
first
step
on
the
slippery
path
downhill
to
a
without
operational
responsibilities
and
without

integrity
of

not
merely
requires
that

that

to

to
turn
the

controversy
now
revolves
mainly
around

of
the

more
particularly
around
the

of
his
relationship
with

have
been
arguing
whether
there
shall
be
four
five

the
most
important
element
in
the
situation
is
not
the
number
of
deputies
but
the
manner
in
which
these
deputies
are
to
do
their
work
any
one
of

has
any
power
to
veto
the

the

they
give
him

when
he
asks
it
or
if
they
perform

under

the
nature
of
the
will
not
of
necessity
change
must
have
subject
to
the
constitutional
direction
of

the

to
propose
action
and
to
organize

without
being
hobbled
by
advisers
and
assistants
acting
on
someone

is
the
root
issue
for
which
the

stand
should
not
become
confused
or
let
our
public
become
confused
over
irrelevant
questions
of
number
or
even
of

we
must
have
if
the

survive
is
as
nonpolitical
nonpartisan
an
organization
at
the
top
as
human

can
make
it
subject

in

this

means
a
concentration
on
the
effects
of
the
revolution
the

gradually
throttled
by
the
regime
more
and
more
publishers

correspondents
were
forced
into
exile

driven
from

into

it

in
a
situation
contrasting
sharply
with
the
script
prepared
many
months
ago
when
this
meeting
was
first
announced
to
the
original
program
expected
the
millions
looking
toward
the
this
morning
to
be
filled
with
admiration
or
rage
depending
upon
individual
or
national
politics
because
of
the
bold
program
for
building
communism
in
our
time
which
the
will
adopt
far
from
being
concerned
about
whether
or
not
will
have
achieved
by
the
world
is
watching
today
primarily
for
clues
as
to
whether
or
not
there
will
be
nuclear
in
the
immediate
future
evident
contradiction
between
the
rosy
picture
of
progress
painted
by
the
program
and
the
enormous
dangers
for
all
humanity
posed
by
policy
has
already
led
to
speculation
abroad
that
the
program
may
be
severely
altered
it
is
or
not
the
propaganda
impact
on
the
free
world
of
the
document
scheduled
to
be
adopted
at
this
meeting
will
be
far
less
than
had
been
originally
anticipated
there
must
be
many
citizens
who
know
what
is
going
on
and
who
realize
that
before
they
can
hope
to
enjoy
the
full
life
promised
for
they
and
their
children
must
first
survive
will
see
consolidating
his
power
and
laying
the
groundwork
for
an
orderly
succession
should
death
or
illness
remove
him
from
the
scene
in
the
next
few
years
widespread
purge
that
has
taken
place
the
past
twelve
months
or
so
among
leaders
in
the
provinces
gives
assurance
that
the
party
officials
who
will
dominate
the
and
the
it
will
elect
will
all
have
passed
the
tightest
possible
screening
both
for
loyalty
to
him
and
for
competence
and
performance
on
the
job
call
to
action
has
earned
a
nationwide
reputation
as
a
moderate
and
unemotional
school
reformer
earlier
reports
considered
the
public
schools
basically
sound
and
not
in
need
of
drastic
change
a
close
look
at
the
schools
in
and
around
the
ten
largest
cities
including

shattered
this
optimism
has
come
away
shocked
and
angry
new
book
entitled
calls
for
fast
and
drastic
action
to
avert
disaster
is
room
for
disagreement
concerning
some
of
specific
views
strong
opposition
to
the
transfer
of
children
to
schools
outside
their
own
neighborhood
in
the
interest
of
integration
will
be
attacked
by
leaders
who
have
fought
for
and
achieved
this
open
or
permissive
enrollment
may
underestimate
the
psychological
importance
of
even
token
equality
suggestion
that
the
prestige
colleges
be
made
the
training
institutions
for
medical
law
and
graduate
schools
will
run
into
strong
opposition
from
these
colleges
themselves
even
though
what
he
is
recommending
is
already
taking
shape
as
a
trend
these
are
side
issues
to
a
powerful
central
theme
theme
cuts
through
hypocrisies
complacency
and
labels
the
slums
especially
the
slums
as
streets
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
youngsters
villains
of
the
piece
are
those
who
deny
job
opportunities
to
these
youngsters
and
accuses
employers
and
labor
unions
alike
facts
he
adds
are
hidden
from
public
view
by
squeamish
objections
to
calling
bad
conditions
by
their
right
name
and
by
insistence
on
token
integration
rather
than
on
real
improvement
of
the
schools
regardless
of
the
color
of
their
students
call
for
action
before
it
is
too
late
has
alarming
implications
when
it
comes
from
a
man
who
in
his
previous
reports
on
the
schools
cautioned
so
strongly
against
extreme
measures
warnings
must
not
be
treated
lightly
conscientious
selfless
efforts
deserve
the
gratitude
has
served
in
positions
of
greater
glamour
both
at
home
and
abroad
but
he
may
well
be
doing
his
greatest
service
with
his
straightforward
report
on
the
state
of
the
public
schools
now
more
junk

fascinating

has
just
reached
this

from

delighted
to

now
going

this

means
an
added
burden
to
innumerable
postmen
who
already
are
complaining
of
heavy
loads
and
low

and
it
presumably
means
an
increased
postal
deficit

our
correspondent
writes
think
of
the
additional
junk

each

will
now
be
privileged
to

not

a
dying
art
letters
are
sent
by
individuals
to

another

are
written
by
companies
to

if

he
said
know
the
cannery
helps
of
us
would
be
willing
to
admit
that
forgiveness
comes
hard
a
person
has
thoughtlessly
or
deliberately
caused
us
pain
or
hardship
it
is
not
always
easy
to
say
forget
it
is
one
thing
know
a
person
will
never
have
spiritual
poise
and
inner
peace
as
long
as
the
heart
holds
a
grudge
know
a
man
who
held
resentment
against
a
neighbor
for
more
than
three
decades
years
ago
was
his
pastor
night
at
the
close
of
the
evening
service
he
came
forward
left
his
resentment
at
the
altar
and
gave
his
heart
to
almost
everyone
had
gone
he
told
me
the
simple
story
of
how
one
of
his
neighbors
had
moved
a
fence
a
few
feet
over
on
his
land
tried
to
settle
this
dispute
he
said
but
could
never
come
to
an
agreement
settled
it
tonight
he
continued
leave
this
church
with
a
feeling
that
a
great
weight
has
been
lifted
off
my
heart
have
left
my
grudge
at
the
altar
and
forgiven
my
neighbor
is
the
door
through
which
a
person
must
pass
to
enter
the
of
cannot
wear
the
banner
of
and
at
the
same
time
harbor
envy
jealousy
and
grudges
in
your
heart
said
and
forget
if
you
can
but
forgive
anyway
made
three
things
clear
about
forgiveness
must
first
of
all
be
willing
to
forgive
others
before
we
can
secure
forgiveness
if
ye
forgive
men
their
trespasses
your
heavenly
will
also
forgive
you
but
if
ye
forgive
not
men
their
trespasses
neither
will
your
forgive
your
trespasses
will
do
no
good
to
seek
forgiveness
until
we
have
forgiven
those
who
have
done
us
wrong
indicated
that
forgiveness
is
unlimited
the
prayer
taught
his
disciples
to
pray
we
find
these
words
us
our
debts
a
person
meets
requirements
for
the
experience
of
forgiveness
he
is
forgiven
mercy
and
patience
will
last
forever
implies
more
than
a
person
wanting
his
past
sins
covered
by
love
also
implies
that
a
man
wants
his
future
to
be
free
from
the
mistakes
of
the
past
want
the
past
forgiven
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
be
willing
for
to
direct
the
future
we
must
be
willing
to
forgive
others
as
many
times
as
they
sin
against
us
asked
oft
shall
my
brother
sin
against
me
and
forgive
him
seven
times
saith
unto
him
until
seventy
times
seven
not
only
taught
forgiveness
gave
us
an
example
of
it
on
the
cross
all
the
energy
of
his
broken
body
he
prayed
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
been
in
and
out
of
my
house
for
a
dozen
years
now
although
still
a
who
looks
like
a
baby
she
is
getting
married
mother
now
dead
was
my
good
friend
and
when
she
came
to
tell
us
about
her
plans
and
to
show
off
her
ring
had
a
sobering
wish
to
say
something
meaningful
to
her
something
her
mother
would
wish
said
a
while
there
was
such
shrill
girlish
commotion
have
made
myself
heard
if
had
the
equivalent
of
the
message
to
when
some
of
the
squeals
had
subsided
and
she
had
been
through
one
of
those
sessions
that
are
so
indispensable
to
the
young
female
six
girls
sprawled
on
one
bed
drinking
and
giggling
she
came
back
to
the
kitchen
to
talk
with
me
a
minute
do
you
know
you
love
somebody
enough
to
get
married
asked
was
the
oldest
and
toughest
question
young
lovers
have
ever
asked
can
you
be
sure
you
sure
asked
looking
at
her
searchingly
wanted
to
grab
her
by
the
arm
and
beg
her
to
wait
to
consider
to
know
for
certain
because
life
is
so
long
and
marriage
is
so
important
if
she
were
just
having
a
normal
case
of
jitters
such
a
question
might
frighten
her
out
of
a
really
good
marriage
in
all
honesty
know
how
you
can
be
sure
know
any
secret
recipe
for
certainty
the
fevered
intoxicating
breathless
state
of
being
in
love
the
usual
signposts
that
guide
you
to
lasting
and
satisfying
relationships
are
sometimes
obscured
knew
of
but
one
test
and
threw
it
out
to
her
for
what
it
was
worth
he
ever
bore
you
asked
me
was
shocked
so
darling
and
mean
went
on
ruthlessly
when
not
talking
about
you
or
himself
or
the
wonders
of
love
is
he
interesting
he
care
about
things
that
matter
to
you
you
visualize
being
stranded
with
him
on
a
desert
island
for
years
and
years
and
still
find
him
fascinating
honey
thought
silently
there
are
plenty
of
desert
islands
in
every
marriage
long
periods
when
hopelessly
stranded
together
if
you
bore
each
other
then
heaven
help
you
came
back
the
other
day
to
reassure
me
has
studied
and
observed
and
she
is
convinced
that
her
young
man
is
going
to
be
endlessly
enchanting
asked
if
had
other
advice
and
heady
with
success
rushed
it
in
hope
not
too
late
friends
with
your
cartoons
and
cynics
to
the
contrary
make
good
friends
do
not
know
well
was
deeply
moved
by
his
letter
of
resignation
as
rector
of
in
was
the
cry
of
not
just
one
heart
it
spoke
for
many
in
the
clergy
suspect
pulpit
is
a
lonely
place
stops
to
think
of
that
the
searching
and
the
prayer
that
lay
behind
the
letter
the
rector
wrote
after
almost
a
decade
of
service
to
this
majestic
church
a
church
needs
vigor
and
vitality
in
its
rector
and
one
man
has
only
so
much
of
these
endowments
he
told
his
members
minister
should
not
stay
beyond
the
time
that
his
leadership
should
benefit
his
church
he
wrote
for
he
becomes
ordinary
so
the
young
minister
resigned
to
go
and
study
and
pray
having
never
passed
a
day
he
told
his
parishioners
when
did
not
gain
from
you
far
more
than
ever
gave
to
you
very
honest
act
called
up
the
recent
talk
had
with
another
minister
a
modest
who
said
feel
so
deeply
blessed
by
when
can
give
a
message
of
love
and
comfort
to
other
men
and
would
have
it
no
other
way
and
it
is
unworthy
to
think
of
self
oh
how
do
sometimes
need
just
a
moment
of
rest
and
peace
in
myself
man
who
gives
himself
to
and
to
the
believers
of
his
church
takes
upon
himself
a
life
of
giving
does
not
expect
to
get
great
riches
or
he
would
not
have
chosen
to
answer
the
call
to
preach
good
ones
are
not
motivated
to
seek
vainly
nor
are
they
disposed
to
covet
comfort
or
they
would
have
been
led
to
fields
that
offer
comfort
and
feed
vanity
is
a
sacrificial
life
by
earthly
standards
we
who
lean
upon
such
a
man
and
draw
strength
from
him
and
expect
interpretation
of
the
infinite
through
him
we
who
readily
accept
his
sacrifice
as
our
due
we
of
the
congregations
are
the
first
to
tell
him
what
is
in
our
minds
instead
of
listening
to
what
is
in
his
soul
press
him
to
conform
to
our
comfortable
conceptions
and
not
to
bruise
our
satisfactions
with
his
word
and
do
not
defeat
the
good
ones
with
this
cruelty
but
we
add
to
their
burden
while
expecting
them
to
bestow
saintliness
upon
us
in
return
for
ostentatious
church
attendance
and
a
few
bucks
a
week
cash
we
break
the
minister
to
our
bit
we
are
buying
back
our
own
sins
he
break
we
add
to
the
stress
he
bears
a
minister
of
all
men
is
most
conscious
that
he
is
mere
man
prone
to
the
stresses
that
earthly
humanity
is
heir
to
expect
him
to
be
noble
and
to
make
us
so
yet
he
knows
and
tries
to
tell
us
how
very
humble
man
must
be
expect
bestowal
of
love
through
him
how
little
love
we
give
him
church
truly
is
not
a
rest
home
for
saints
but
a
hospital
for
sinners
every
we
sinners
go
to
that
emergency
room
to
receive
first
aid
and
we
leave
unmindful
that
the
man
who
ministered
to
us
is
a
human
being
who
suffers
too
always
particularly
enjoyed
the
last
night
of
each
summer
at
narrow
fringe
of
sadness
that
ran
around
it
only
emphasized
the
pleasure
evening
was
not
always
spent
in
the
same
way
year
on
a
night
cool
with
the
front
of
moving
in
but
with
plenty
of
summer
still
about
the
were
holding
a
neighborhood
gathering
in
the
little
cottage
was
bursting
with
people
of
all
ages
the
midst
of
it
all
came
out
on
the
porch
alone
had
that
day
attended
a
country
auction
and
he
had
come
back
with
a
prize
prize
was
an
woven
cloth
hammock
complete
with
pillow
fringed
side
pieces
and
hooks
for
hanging
had
obligingly
pushed
things
around
on
the
porch
to
make
room
for
it
and
there
it
was
slung
in
a
corner
the
night
breeze
rippling
its
fringe
with
a
slow
caressing
movement
sat
down
in
it
pushed
himself
back
and
forth
in
one
or
two
slow
rhythmic
motions
and
then
swung
his
feet
up
into
it
closed
his
eyes
and
let
the
unintelligible
drift
of
voices
sweep
pleasantly
over
him
one
young
voice
rose
above
the
others
it
said
do
you
always
know
when
happy
voice
sank
back
into
the
general
tangle
of
sound
but
the
question
stayed
in
mind
in
the
cool
evening
mentally
retraced
a
day
that
had
left
him
greatly
contented
and
at
peace
had
begun
with
the
blue
jay
feather
along
the
lake
before
breakfast
had
seen
the
feather
and
the
bird
that
had
lost
it
in
flight
winging
spread
of
blue
had
gone
on
calling
harshly
into
the
wood
small
shaft
of
blue
had
drifted
down
and
come
to
rest
at
his
feet
day
long
who
was
a
man
in
the
summer
had
worn
the
feather
in
the
band
of
his
sunshield
a
blue
feather
in
a
hat
make
him
happy
all
day
it
was
something
to
have
seen
it
floating
down
through
the
early
morning
sunshine
linking
the
blue
of
the
sky
with
the
blue
of
the
asters
by
the
lake
since
the
auction
was
being
held
nearby
he
had
walked
to
it
there
on
the
way
had
been
the
box
turtle
that
slow
relic
of
bent
for
reasons
best
known
to
itself
on
crossing
the
road
was
doing
very
well
too
having
reached
the
center
and
was
pursuing
its
way
with
commendable
singleness
of
purpose
when
saw
hazard
approaching
in
the
shape
of
a
flashy
little
sports
car
the
driver
see
the
turtle
he
take
pains
to
avoid
it
took
no
chances
off
his
hat
and
signaling
the
driver
with
it
stepped
into
the
road
lifted
the
surprised
turtle
and
consummated
its
with
what
must
have
been
a
suddenness
turtle
immediately
withdrew
into
its
private
council
room
to
study
the
phenomenon
and
the
driver
of
the
sports
car
waved
at
each
other
in
the
cool
darkness
could
still
feel
the
warmth
of
midday
could
still
see
the
yellow
butterflies
dancing
over
the
road
could
still
see
the
friendly
grin
on
the
young
face
as
the
driver
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
before
the
car
streaked
out
of
sight
was
the
driver
now
was
he
doing
the
turtle
smiled
a
few
brief
minutes
they
had
all
been
part
of
one
little
drama
three
would
never
meet
again
but
for
some
reason
or
other
was
sure
he
would
always
remember
the
incident
there
had
been
the
auction
itself
heard
again
at
will
the
voice
of
the
auctioneer
the
voices
of
the
bidders
and
finally
the
small
boy
who
had
been
so
interested
in
hammock
purchase
like
them
things
too
he
had
said
got
one
at
home
know
what
out
in
the
hammock
at
night
and
it
gets
kinda
cool
you
know
you
just
take
these
sides
with
the
fringe
on
see
and
wrap
right
over
you
do
it
lots
times
like
to
lie
in
a
hammock
at
night
by
myself
when
all
quiet
wind
moves
it
a
little
bit
you
know
had
thanked
him
gravely
and
now
he
made
use
of
the
advice
he
pulled
the
fringed
sides
up
and
made
himself
into
a
cocoon
saw
that
thin
attractive
freckled
little
face
again
and
hoped
that
the
boy
too
was
lying
in
a
cool
quiet
the
cat
came
by
the
hammock
rubbed
her
back
briefly
against
it
and
then
sure
of
a
welcome
hopped
up
remarked
that
she
found
the
night
wind
a
little
chilly
and
took
her
inside
the
fringe
her
purring
rivaled
the
chirping
of
the
tree
crickets
rivaled
the
hum
of
voices
from
inside
the
was
just
adding
this
to
his
pictures
of
the
day
when
the
screen
door
opened
and
burst
out
said
getting
so
chilly
lighted
a
fire
and
going
to
tell
a
round
robin
story
a
nice
scary
one
need
you
to
start
it
are
you
out
here
all
by
yourself
you
happy
opened
his
cocoon
and
emerged
tucking
under
his
arm
to
bring
her
in
by
the
fire
course
am
he
said
happier
in
my
life
just
came
out
here
to
know
it
the
begins
another
school
year
national
and
even
world
attention
is
directed
at
the
slow
progress
toward
racial
equality
in
the
public
schools
is
beginning
in
two
more
important
cities
and
each
city
civic
and
education
leaders
have
been
working
hard
to
get
public
opinion
prepared
to
accept
the
inevitability
of
equal
treatment
programs
emphasize
the
acceptance
of
biracial
classrooms
peacefully
programs
do
not
take
sides
on
the
issue
itself
point
out
simply
that
it
is
the
law
of
the
land
two
cities
have
the
examples
of
and
to
hold
up
as
warnings
against
resorting
to
violence
to
try
to
stop
the
processes
of
desegregation
better
they
have
the
examples
of
and
to
hold
up
as
peaceful
and
progressive
programs
each
case
there
was
an
initial
act
of
violence
a
school
was
dynamited
there
were
a
few
incidents
of
friction
between
whites
and
none
of
which
were
serious
each
city
quick
public
reaction
and
fast
action
by
the
city
government
halted
the
threats
of
more
serious
incidents
plan
incidentally
has
become
recognized
as
perhaps
the
most
acceptable
and
thus
the
most
practical
to
put
into
effect
in
the
troubled
is
a
plan
in
which
desegregation
begins
in
the
first
grade
year
another
grade
is
added
to
the
process
until
finally
all
grades
are
integrated
schedules
are
flexible
so
that
the
program
can
be
accelerated
as
the
public
becomes
more
tolerant
or
realizes
that
it
is
something
that
has
to
be
done
so
why
not
now
program
has
worked
well
in
both
and
met
a
serious
rebuff
in
where
the
two
schools
selected
for
the
first
moves
toward
integration
were
boycotted
by
white
parents
attempt
will
be
made
this
year
in
to
resume
the
program
throughout
the
there
is
a
growing
impatience
with
the
pattern
of
violence
with
which
every
step
of
desegregation
is
met
the
most
eloquent
move
toward
removal
of
racial
barriers
has
been
in
the
summer
began
quietly
patronizing
previously
segregated
restaurants
and
lunch
counters
in
downtown
retail
establishments
was
part
of
a
citywide
move
toward
full
integration
successful
has
been
this
program
worked
out
by
white
and
civic
leaders
that
further
extensions
are
expected
in
the
next
few
months
for
example
are
ready
to
let
down
the
bars
at
least
one
hotel
has
been
quietly
taking
reservations
on
a
nonracial
basis
conventions
have
been
held
in
recent
months
in
hotels
on
a
nonsegregated
basis
is
a
radical
change
in
attitude
from
the
conditions
which
prevailed
several
years
ago
when
a
series
of
bombings
was
directed
against
who
were
moving
into
previously
neighborhoods
of
is
also
symptomatic
of
a
change
in
attitude
which
appears
to
be
spreading
all
across
the
whites
themselves
are
realizing
that
they
had
been
wrong
in
using
violence
to
try
to
stop
from
claiming
equal
rights
insist
they
are
ashamed
of
such
violence
and
intimidation
as
occurred
in
when
the
sought
to
break
down
racial
discrimination
in
local
bus
depots
across
the
there
are
signs
that
racial
violence
is
finding
less
approval
among
whites
who
themselves
would
never
take
active
part
but
might
once
have
shown
a
tolerant
attitude
toward
it
are
many
causes
for
this
change
of
the
most
important
is
economic
leaders
are
aware
now
that
they
suffer
greatly
from
any
outbreak
of
violence
are
putting
strong
pressure
on
their
police
departments
to
keep
order
the
past
these
same
were
inclined
to
look
the
other
way
as
the
businessmen
have
begun
to
act
a
real
sense
of
has
sprung
up
has
emboldened
other
whites
to
add
their
voices
to
demands
for
peaceable
accommodation
realize
that
by
acting
in
concert
rather
than
individually
they
will
not
be
picked
out
as
objects
of
retaliation
economic
and
otherwise
moving
from
a
suburb
to
a
few
months
ago
been
introduced
to
a
new
game
called
mostly
on
the
freeways
around
it
goes
like
this
driver
cruising
easily
at
in
of
a
freeway
spies
an
incipient
traffic
jam
ahead
in
the
next
lane
appears
to
be
moving
more
smoothly
so
he
pokes
a
tentative
fender
into
which
is
heavily
populated
by
cars
also
moving
at
adjacent
driver
in
has
three
choices
open
to
him
can
point
his
car
resolutely
at
the
invading
fender
and
force
the
other
driver
back
into
slow
down
and
permit
the
ambivalent
driver
to
change
lanes
or
alternately
accelerate
and
decelerate
thus
keeping
the
first
driver
guessing
as
to
his
intentions
thereby
making
a
fascinating
sport
of
the
whole
affair
really
remarkable
thing
to
me
is
that
most
natives
unhesitatingly
elect
to
slow
down
and
permit
the
invading
car
free
access
or
not
this
is
done
out
of
enlightened
know
it
is
done
consistently
and
both
surprised
and
impressed
could
never
happen
in
my
native
such
soggy
acquiesence
would
be
looked
upon
as
a
sure
sign
of
deteriorating
manhood
the
driver
cut
out
would
likely
jam
his
gas
pedal
to
the
floor
in
an
effort
to
force
the
other
car
back
this
he
would
pull
alongside
at
the
first
opportunity
and
shake
his
fist
threateningly
negative
explanation
of
courtesy
on
the
freeways
however
does
an
injustice
to
drivers
the
risk
of
losing
my
at
and
would
like
to
challenge
an
old
and
hallowed
stereotype
three
months
of
research
can
state
unequivocally
that
drivers
are
considerably
more
courteous
and
competent
than
any
other
drivers
ever
encountered
one
recent
day
of
driving
about
there
were
actually
a
dozen
occasions
when
oncoming
drivers
stopped
an
entire
lane
of
traffic
to
permit
me
to
pull
out
of
an
impossible
side
street
writer
came
up
to
today
and
asked
the
manager
if
he
thought
his
ball
club
would
be
improved
this
year
of
course
is
known
as
a
deep
thinker
as
baseball
managers
go
can
often
make
the
complex
ridiculously
simple
and
vice
versa
happened
to
be
vice
versa
but
even
so
the
answer
was
a
masterpiece
a
whole
lot
easier
he
said
to
increase
the
population
of
than
it
is
to
increase
the
population
of
city
with
that
he
walked
off
to
give
instruction
to
a
rookie
pitcher
is
undoubtedly
a
hell
of
a
quote
said
the
writer
scratching
his
head
if
can
just
figure
out
what
talking
about
use
it
spots
open
was
just
way
of
saying
that
last
year
the
opened
spring
training
with
a
lot
of
jobs
wide
open
brilliant
rookies
nailed
them
down
so
that
this
spring
just
two
spots
left
and
right
field
are
really
up
for
grabs
should
be
easier
to
plug
two
spots
than
it
was
to
fill
the
wholesale
lots
that
were
open
last
year
but
so
far
it
worked
that
way
angle
of
just
where
the
can
look
for
improvement
this
year
is
an
interesting
one
never
guess
it
from
the
way
played
so
far
this
spring
but
there
remains
a
feeling
among
some
around
here
that
the
still
have
a
chance
to
battle
for
the
pennant
in
if
this
club
is
going
to
move
from
second
to
first
in
the
it
will
have
to
show
improvement
someplace
can
that
improvement
possibly
come
from
certainly
expect
the
infield
to
do
any
better
than
it
did
last
year
could
be
better
is
great
and
it
is
conceivable
that
do
even
better
in
than
he
did
in
expect
it
though
performance
last
year
was
tremendous
the
same
with
and
they
do
as
well
as
they
did
in
there
can
be
no
complaint
be
asked
to
carry
any
more
of
the
burden
will
be
getting
a
late
spring
training
start
which
might
very
well
set
him
back
got
off
to
an
exceptional
start
last
season
and
under
the
circumstances
probably
duplicate
it
are
some
clubs
which
claim
they
learned
something
about
pitching
to
him
last
year
expect
to
stop
him
just
slow
him
down
some
with
the
bat
still
be
a
top
player
they
concede
because
got
a
great
glove
and
the
long
ball
going
for
him
they
expect
to
reduce
his
offensive
production
might
move
up
can
hardly
do
better
than
drive
in
runs
ask
him
more
have
a
hunch
might
move
up
a
notch
even
so
he
had
a
good
year
in
and
do
too
much
better
all
in
all
the
infield
be
expected
to
supply
the
added
improvement
to
propel
the
from
second
to
first
the
pitching
will
also
have
trouble
doing
better
got
a
great
performance
out
of
his
combination
of
youth
and
experience
last
season
then
can
we
look
for
improvement
and
answers
the
ones
we
can
expect
to
do
better
man
is
right
and
at
this
time
indications
are
that
these
three
are
ready
for
better
seasons
proved
it
yet
but
he
says
convinced
his
thumb
is
all
right
jammed
it
this
spring
and
has
had
to
rest
it
but
he
says
the
old
injury
bothered
him
he
can
bounce
back
with
one
of
those
home
runs
years
the
club
will
have
to
be
better
off
offensively
still
not
convinced
though
have
to
see
more
of
him
before
predicting
that
big
year
for
him
backed
up
by
who
will
be
within
calling
distance
in
the
minors
make
up
better
second
line
catching
than
the
had
all
last
year
but
is
still
that
big
man
you
need
when
you
start
talking
pennant
me
looks
as
though
he
could
be
in
for
a
fine
year
played
too
much
because
has
been
working
on
him
furiously
in
batting
practice
hitting
the
ball
hard
in
the
batting
cage
and
his
whole
attitude
is
improved
over
this
time
last
year
he
came
to
he
was
leaving
a
team
which
was
supposed
to
win
the
pennant
and
he
was
joining
what
seemed
to
be
a
second
division
club
was
down
hard
to
talk
to
and
far
too
nonchalant
on
the
field
of
now
that
all
seems
behind
him
been
entirely
different
all
spring
looks
stronger
seems
to
be
throwing
better
than
he
did
last
year
him
bounce
back
and
he
could
really
set
up
the
staff
if
the
are
to
improve
and
will
have
to
do
it
far
the
platoons
on
left
and
right
fielders
seem
capable
of
carrying
the
load
course
this
taking
into
consideration
the
population
of
and
city
but
the
way
things
look
from
here
at
this
point
the
mother
of
an
autistic
child
at
fault
autistic
child
is
one
who
seems
to
lack
a
sense
of
self
tends
to
treat
himself
and
other
people
as
if
they
were
objects
and
sometimes
he
treats
objects
as
if
they
were
people
his
mother
make
him
this
way
people
believe
she
did
think
differently
believe
that
autism
like
so
many
other
conditions
of
defect
and
deviation
is
to
a
large
extent
inborn
mother
can
help
a
child
adapt
to
his
difficulties
she
can
to
a
large
extent
help
him
overcome
them
we
think
she
creates
them
think
she
can
make
her
child
defective
emotionally
disturbed
or
autistic
mother
of
a
difficult
child
can
do
a
great
deal
to
help
her
own
child
and
often
by
sharing
her
experiences
she
can
help
other
mothers
with
the
same
problem
little
is
known
about
autism
and
almost
nothing
has
been
written
for
the
layman
like
to
share
one
experienced
comments
wrote
total
disinterest
the
mother
of
an
autistic
child
who
is
lacking
in
interest
and
enthusiasm
about
almost
anything
have
to
manipulate
my
fingers
for
him
when
he
first
plays
with
a
new
toy
wants
me
to
do
everything
for
him
believe
that
autistic
children
become
autistic
because
of
something
that
happens
to
them
or
because
of
the
way
their
mother
treats
them
do
and
my
psychiatrist
does
too
know
that
my
son
wants
control
and
direction
but
being
autistic
myself
cannot
give
full
control
or
direction
thing
notice
which
have
seldom
heard
mentioned
is
that
autistic
people
enjoy
physical
contact
with
others
for
instance
my
children
and
hold
my
son
he
stiffens
his
whole
body
in
my
arms
until
he
is
as
straight
and
stiff
as
a
board
pushes
and
straightens
himself
as
if
he
stand
the
feeling
of
being
held
contact
is
uncomfortable
for
him
mother
is
quite
correct
a
rule
the
autistic
child
enjoy
physical
contact
with
others
have
to
find
other
ways
of
comforting
him
the
young
child
this
may
be
no
more
than
providing
food
light
or
movement
he
grows
older
it
may
be
a
matter
of
providing
some
accustomed
object
his
magic
thing
certain
words
or
rituals
that
child
and
adult
go
through
may
do
the
trick
answer
is
different
for
each
autistic
child
but
for
most
there
is
an
answer
ingenuity
will
uncover
it
future
holds
learned
this
year
that
our
older
son
is
autistic
did
not
accept
the
diagnosis
at
once
but
gradually
we
are
coming
to
there
is
a
nursery
school
which
he
has
been
able
to
attend
with
a
group
of
normal
children
try
to
treat
as
if
he
were
normal
though
of
course
realize
he
is
far
from
that
at
present
do
is
to
try
to
bring
him
into
contact
with
reality
as
much
as
possible
try
to
give
him
as
many
normal
experiences
as
possible
is
your
experience
with
autistic
children
do
they
turn
out
later
autistic
children
grow
up
to
lead
relatively
normal
lives
most
continue
to
lack
a
certain
warmth
in
communication
with
other
people
but
many
adjust
to
school
even
college
to
jobs
and
even
to
marriage
and
parenthood
use
question
first
grader
colors
pictures
one
solid
color
everything
sky
grass
boy
wagon
different
colors
are
used
she
is
just
as
likely
to
color
trees
purple
hair
green
other
children
in
the
class
use
this
same
coloring
book
and
do
a
fairly
good
job
with
things
their
proper
color
show
my
daughter
how
things
should
be
colored
is
an
aggressive
nervous
child
a
relaxed
home
atmosphere
enough
to
help
her
outgrow
these
traits
choice
of
one
color
means
she
is
simply
enjoying
the
motor
act
of
coloring
without
having
reached
the
point
of
selecting
suitable
colors
for
different
objects
immature
use
of
crayons
may
suggest
that
she
is
a
little
immature
for
the
first
grade
coloring
exactly
something
you
teach
a
child
sometimes
give
them
a
little
demonstration
a
little
guidance
and
suggestions
about
staying
inside
the
lines
most
learn
to
color
and
paint
as
and
when
they
are
ready
with
only
a
very
little
demonstration
in
decorating
circles
of
late
is
a
renewed
interest
in
an
old
art
embroidery
responsible
for
this
is
the
incoming
trend
toward
multicolor
schemes
in
rooms
which
seems
slated
to
replace
the
look
to
which
we
have
been
accustomed
as
a
varitinted
rug
may
suggest
the
starting
point
for
a
room
scheme
so
may
some
of
the
newest
versions
of
embroidery
such
in
fact
is
a
rug
not
actually
crewel
embroidery
it
has
that
look
with
its
raised
pattern
in
blue
pink
bronze
and
gold
and
a
sauterne
background
twirled
stylized
design
of
winding
stems
and
floral
forms
strongly
suggests
the
embroidered
patterns
used
so
extensively
for
upholstery
during
the
period
in
crewel
embroidery
which
seems
to
be
appearing
more
frequently
this
fall
than
in
the
past
few
years
is
still
available
in
this
country
work
is
executed
in
by
hand
and
can
be
worked
in
any
desired
design
and
color
some
recent
imports
were
seat
covers
for
one
series
of
dining
room
chairs
on
which
were
depicted

plates
overflowing
with
tomatoes
and
greens
and
another
set

with

revered
period
the
work

only

it
is
said
is
that
of
human
conception
embroidered
panels
framed

meant
to
be
hung
on

are
another
aspect
of
this
trend
have
never
gone
out
of
style
in
homes
and
now
seem
to
be
reappearing
here
and
there
in

the

out
into

array
of

leaders
and
standing
committees
and
thence
into
its
component

groups

so
of
its

from
the
comfortable
knowledge
that

consequence

to
the
the
entire
state
hierarchy

down

in
this
huge
operation

their

thus
far
have
given
no
indication
that
be
willing
to
join
forces
under
a
single
directorate

in
the
most
fashion
believes
that
reapportionment
which
left
many

to

is
impressed
with
the
dignity
clarity
and
beauty
of
this
new
translation
into

and
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
meaning
of
the
is
more
easily
understandable
to
the
general
reader
in
contemporary
language
in
the
frequently
archaic
words
and
phrases
of
the
example
in
the
third
chapter
of
verses
describing
the
baptism
of
the
version
reads
cometh
from
to
unto
to
be
baptized
of
him
forbad
him
saying
have
need
to
be
baptized
of
thee
and
comest
thou
to
me
answering
said
unto
him
it
to
be
so
now
for
thus
it
becometh
us
to
fulfill
all
righteousness
he
suffered
him
when
he
was
baptized
went
up
straightway
out
of
the
water
and
lo
the
heavens
were
opened
unto
him
and
he
saw
the
of
descending
like
a
dove
and
lighting
upon
him
meaning
the
meaning
is
clearer
to
one
who
is
not
familiar
with
teachings
in
the
which
reads
arrived
at
from
and
he
came
to
to
be
baptized
by
him
tried
to
dissuade
him
you
come
to
me
said
need
rather
to
be
baptized
by
you
replied
let
it
be
so
for
the
present
we
do
well
to
conform
this
way
with
all
that
requires
then
allowed
him
to
come

up
out
of
the
water
at
once
and
at
that
moment

opened

the
of
descending
like

to
alight
upon
him

the
most
frequently
quoted
sentences
are
the
and
yet
so
few
persons
other
than

really
understand
the
true
meaning
of
these
eight
blessings

that
they

the
kingdom

theirs
of
the
poetic
cadence
of
the
older
version
certainly
is
lost
in
the
newer
one
but
almost
anyone
with
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
language
can
understand
the
meaning
without
the
necessity
of
interpretation
by
a
scholar
a
novice
that
is
significant
the
second
and
third
chapters
of
the
new
version

however
the
old
phrase

of
the
church
which
scholars
have
previously
interpreted
as
meaning
bishop

not
contemporary
contemporary
the
most
part
however
the
new
version

as
such
should

for
many
to

clearer
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of

hundreds
of
years
ago

homecomings
are
usually
rather
cruel
and
sad

only
the
perpetually
ebullient
and
the
continually
optimistic
are
made
happy
by
them
often
than
not
as
the
wanders
along
the
old
paths
his
memory
of
happy
days
when
he
strolled
one
of
the
paths
with
a
coed
beside
him
becomes
an
ache
and
a
pain
can
smell
again
the
perfume
she
wore
and
recall
the
lilting
sound
of
laughter
and
can
smell
again
the
aroma
of
autumn
fallen
leaves
the
wine
of
cool
air
and
the
nostalgia
of
woodsmoke
which
blows
through
all
the
winds
of
fall
is
at
precisely
such
moments
that
he
encounters
a
couple
of
undergraduates
faces
alight
holding
hands
and
talking
happily
as
they
come
along
oblivious
of
him
or
throwing
him
the
most
fleeting
and
casual
of
glances
such
as
they
would
give
a
tethered
goat
they
titter
loudly
after
they
have
passed
by

goes
feels
suddenly
the
weight
of
the
fat
that
is
on
him
bridgework
or
his
plates
feel
loose
and
monstrous
bifocals
blur
legs
suddenly
feel
heavy
and
unaccountably
weary
as
if
he
had
walked
for
miles
instead
of
strolling
a
few
hundred
yards
along
the
old
campus
paths
comes
over
him
and
the
taste
of
time
is
like
unripe
persimmons
in
his
mouth
is
not
much
better
if
he
meets
with
old
classmates
often
unless
he
hails
them
they
pass
him
by
recalls
with
a
wry
smile
the
wit
who
said
on
returning
from
a
homecoming
reunion
that
he
would
never
go
again
because
all
his
class
had
changed
so
much
they
even
recognize
him
they
do
meet
and
recognize
one
another
slap
backs
and
embrace
the
moment
soon
is
done
all
when
one
has
asked
whatever
became
of
old
and
when
one
has
inquired
who
it
was
married
and
where
it
is
they
now
live
when
questions
are
asked
and
answered
about
families
and
children
and
old
professors
when
the
game
and
its
probable
outcome
has
been
exhausted
that
does
it
spread
then
one
begins
to
notice
the
spread
the
gray
hairs
the
eyeglasses
bodies
that
are
too
thin
or
too
heavy
the
fading
signs
of
old
beauty
the
athlete
of
years
who
wears
a

suit
and
puffs
when
he
has
finished
a
sentence
of
any
length

it

to
break
it
up

anything
worse

there
on

him
never

a

feels
he
is
a

the

next
to
him
the
stands
he
is
lonely
and
lost
no

how
many
are
about
him
sits
there
remembering
the
tense
moment
before
the
ball
was
snapped
the
churning
of
straining
feet
the
rasp
of
the
canvas
pants
the
smell
and
feel

hot

across
his

the
desperate
panting
breath
the
long
runs
on

the
hard
jolting

the

the
desperate
agony
of

so
he
squirms
with

how

goes
back

this
error
it
is
in
the
process
of
so
doing
because
it
apparently
gives
priority
to
trying
to
downgrade
this
is
not
good
politics
is
underscored
by
the
latest
poll
figures
which
show
that
per
cent
of
the
people
like
the
way
in
which
the
new
is
conducting
the
business
most
articulate
are
those
who
in
their
desire
to
get
back
at
already
have
created
the
image
of
a
leadership
which
is
reluctant
to
assist
the
distressed
and
the
unemployed
and
which
is
even
more
unwilling
to
help
old
people
who
need
medical
care
they
also
defeat
the
school
bill
the
task
force
have
much
research
to
do
will
early
know
why
the
party
win
back
city
votes
has
important
business
to
consider
tragedy
is
that
it
will
not
be
able
to
transact
that
business
in
any
responsible
manner
the
political
troup
has
completed
the
circuit
in
in
the
name
of
a
this
is
going
to
be
the
most
politically
oriented
in
history
legislator
from
to
is
going
to
have
his
every
vote
subjected
to
the
closest
scrutiny
as
a
test
of
his
political
allegiances
not
his
convictions
legislative
action
on
adjustment
of
the
county
unit
system
stands
less
chance
than
ever
just
how
far
can
the
go
toward
setting
up
a
system
for
the
state
in
the
midst
of
a
race
unpartisan
will
be
the
recommendations
of
on
situation
already
was
bad
because
the
moved
the
race
forward
a
few
months
causing
the
campaigning
to
get
started
earlier
than
usual
when
former
and
accepted
the
invitations
of
the
of
to
join
the
tour
next
the
situation
was
aggravated
had
a
choice
other
than
to
accept
the
invitation
have
refused
would
have
been
political
suicide
it
may
be
that
one
or
both
men
actually
welcomed
the
opportunity
when
the
bravado
comments
are
cast
aside
of
tried
to
guard
against
the
danger
of
eliminating
potential
candidates
wanted
the
to
pick
the
serious
candidates
of
said
no
and
he
mince
any
words
are
just
asking
too
much
he
said
think
of
anyone
else
who
would
want
to
separate
serious
candidates
from
other
candidates
either
are
other
dangers
is
an
accelerating
game
an
opponent
accuses
you
of
lying
deny
it
he
is
a
horse
thief
runs
an
old
adage
men
are
spenders
either
one
ever
started
making
promises
there
is
no
telling
where
the
promises
would
end
and
miles
of
county
contracts
would
look
like
oaths
trouble
is
that
at
first
glance
the
idea
looks
like
such
a
good
one
not
have
them
travel
the
state
in
debating
would
present
a
forum
for
them
in
almost
every
community
further
thought
brings
the
shuddery
visions
of
a
race
being
run
in
the
next
the
spectre
of
big
spending
programs
the
ooze
of
mudslinging
before
the
campaign
should
even
begin
is
a
way
out
of
this
has
not
arranged
a
forum
has
arranged
a
campaign
for
governor
it
will
simply
delay
the
debates
until
the
qualifications
are
closed
next
spring
and
then
carry
all
the
candidates
on
a
tour
of
debates
it
can
provide
a
service
to
the

the
should
be
granted

complete
its
work

their

praying
editorial
entitled
points
to
a
dilemma
that
faces
communities
such
as
ours
suggested
solution
it
seems
to
me
is
grossly
oversimplified
and
is
inconsistent
with
your
generally
realistic
attitude
toward
and
endorsement
of
sound
planning
of
all
there
is
ample
area
in
already
zoned
in
the
classification
similar
to
that
which
petitioner
requested
land
is
in
various
stages
of
development
in
several
locations
throughout
the
town
demand
for
these
lots
can
be
met
for
some
time
to
come
would
seem
to
indicate
that
we
are
trying
neither
to
halt
an
influx
of
migrants
nor
are
we
setting
up
such
standards
for
development
that
only
the
could
afford
to
buy
land
and
build
in
the
new
sites
we
are
attempting
to
do
is
achieve
and
maintain
a
balance
between
medium
density
and
low
density
residential
areas
and
industrial
and
commercial
development
is
in
fact
entirely
consistent
with
your
suggestion
of
modest
industrial
development
to
help
pay
governmental
costs
is
approximately
half
way
through
a
exemption
of
their
real
estate
tax
wisdom
of
granting
such
tax
exemptions
is
another
matter
but
this
particular
instance
is
in
my
opinion
completely
satisfactory
tax
book
for
indicates
a
valuation
for
this
property
in
excess
of
two
million
dollars
our
current
per
hundred
tax
rate
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
this
will
qualify
when
you
suggest
a
community
should
try
to
develop
a
modest
industrial
plant
as
the
best
way
to
meet
these
problems
order
to
attract
additional
industry
that
is
compatible
with
this
community
it
is
all
the
more
important
to
present
to
the
industrial
prospect
an
orderly
balance
in
the
tax
structure
this
tax
base
grows
so
then
can
your
medium
and
low
density
residential
areas
grow
executive
director
of
the
and
in
his
remarks
to
the
on
at
on
warned
against
the
fallacy
of
attempting
to
attract
industry
solely
to
reduce
the
tax
rate
or
to
underwrite
municipal
services
such
as
schools
when
he
said
this
is
the
fundamental
reason
for
a
interest
or
if
this
is
the
basic
approach
success
if
any
will
be
difficult
to
obtain
went
on
to
say
the
first
place
industry
per
se
is
not
dedicated
to
the
role
of
savior
of
foundering
municipalities
is
not
in
business
for
the
purpose
of
absorbing
increased
municipal
costs
no
matter
how
high
a
purpose
that
may
be
cited
the
anticipated
increase
in
school
costs
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
from
a
taxpayer
the
impact
upon
a
school
system
does
not
have
to
be
measured
only
in
increased
taxes
to
find
alarm
in
uncontrolled
growth
in

the
example
of
two
neighboring
communities
one
currently
utilizing
double
sessions
in
their
schools

the
other
facing
this
prospect

already
been
reported
in

one
elementary

the
high
school

insure
future
accommodations
for
a
school
population
that
we
know
will
increase
they
are
to
be
commended
for
foresight
in
their
planning
what
then
is
the
judgment
of
a
town
council
that
compounds
this
problem
during
the
planning
stage
then
is
the
sound
planning
and
cooperation
between
agencies
within
the
community
that
you
have
called
for
in
other
editorials
submit
that
it
cannot
be
dismissed
simply
by
saying
we
are
not

the
facts

am
greatly
concerned
with
the

the
relation
between
types

as
believe
it

an
area
in
which
professional
planners
have
failed
to
set
adequate
guide
posts
and
yet
they
cannot
ignore
this
problem
because
it
concerns
the
implementation
of
nearly
all
the
planning
programs
they
have
devised
programs
are
volumes
of
waste
paper
and
lost
hours
if
the
citizens
of
a

must
stand
aside

land
developers
tell
them

and
in
what
manner
the
community
shall
grow

far
less
to
fear
in
the
migrant
family
than
we
have
in

these
conditions
professional
planners
meet
this
situation
squarely
and
update

concepts
of
zoning
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
the

we
in
can
continue
to
shape
our
own

like
very
much
on

of
my

myself
to
send
our
eternal
thanks
to
all
the

indeed
true
as
stated
in
the
famous
novel
of
our
day
that
no

is
an
island
entirely
of
itself
every
man
is
a
piece

a

of

to
regional
director

who
asked
them
to
serve

is
through
them
that
we
have
become
aware
of
the
divine
humanity
in

therefore
that
most

are
noble
helpful

good

that
brotherhood
becomes

having

very
interested
in

few
weeks
ago
read
in
the
that
there
were
to
be
given
classes
in
article
also
said
that
a
person
had
to
be
years
old
or
over
and
must
not
be
going
to
high
school
to
attend
these
classes
following
week
read
in
the
paper
that
the
students
of
begin
and
languages
in
the
seventh
grade
wish
you
could
see
the
situation
as
see
it
pupils
have
to
take
these
languages
how
come
students
have
a
choice
whether
or
not
to
take
a
language
but
have
to
face
so
many
exceptions
do
not
think
that
is
like
not
in
the

am
proud
of
my
country
the
small
city
live
in
my
wonderful
parents
my
friends
and
my
school
but
am
also
a
young
able
and
willing
girl
who
wants
to
study
the
language
but
is
not
old
enough
people
wonder
why
pupils
are
more
advanced
than
students
there
lies
your
answer
the
height
of
the
first
snowstorm
we
had
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
get
medical
attention
needed
during
an
emergency
the
made
its
way
through
to
my
home
in
time
of
desperation
cannot
tell
of
the
undivided
attention
and
comfort
their
service
gave
to
me
concern
they
felt
for
me
was
such
as
shall
never
forget
and
for
which
will
always
be
grateful
rescue
squad
is
to
be
praised
immensely
for
the
fine
work
they
do
in
all
kinds
of
weather
they
not
gotten
me
to
the
hospital
when
they
did
perhaps
would
not
be
here
to
commend
them
at
this
time
thanks
for
a
job
well
done
article
asking
whether
taxpayers
are
being
victimized
by
a
gigantic
giveaway
to
pay
for
the
care
of
war
veterans
who
have
disabilities
sounds
as
though
is
desperate
for
news
a
veteran
has
to
hang
himself
to
get
space
on
the
front
page
the
question
of
admission
to
hospitals
of
and
disabled
veterans
it
must
be
recognized
that
there
are
many
men
who
are
greatly
affected
by
war
service
can
manifest
itself
before
discharge
from
service
or
it
can
come
out
years
later
is
one
other
point
we
should
never
lose
sight
of
veterans
who
enter
hospitals
as
cases
later
qualify
as
psychiatrist
could
tell
me
that
the
experience
in
a
war
can
not
have
its
effect
in
the
ensuing
years
arguments
advanced
by
those
individuals

groups
who
oppose
the
system
in
force
and
who
would
drastically
curtail
or
do
away
entirely
with
hospital
care
for
the
case
seem
to
be
coldly
impractical
and
with
the
wishes
of
the
general
public
believe
in
priority
for
disabled
veterans
in
admission
to
hospitals
believe
we
should
close
the
door
on
patients
matter
is
of
great
importance
and
the
outcome
may
mean
the
difference
between
life
or
death
or
at
least
serious
injuries
for
many
veterans
critics
say
that
the
length
of
stay
in
a
hospital
is
too
long
a
reason
for
this
length
of
stay
of
all
the
admitting
physician
in
the
hospital
gets
the
patient
as
a
new
patient
has
no
experience
with
this
previous
medical
record
the
doctor
is
conscientious
he
wants
to
study
the
patient
a
result
it
takes
a
little
longer
than
it
would
on
the
outside
where
the
family
physician
knows
about
the
patient
the
physician
knows
that
when
the
patient
leaves
the
hospital
he
is
no
longer
going
to
have
a
chance
to
visit
his
patient
he
keeps
the
veteran
in
until
he
can
observe
the
effects
of
treatment
or
surgery
public
must
be
presented
with
the
facts
concerning
hospitalization
public
should
understand
that
whether
they
support
a
state
hospital
or
a
hospital
the
tax
dollar
has
to
be
paid
one
way
or
the
other
responsibility
is
still
going
to
be
there
whether
they
pay
for
a
hospital
or
the
tax
dollar
is
spent
for
the
state
hospital
adequate
system
of
hospitals
is
better
equipped
to
care
for
the
veterans
than
any
state
hospitals
seems
that
open

upon
hospitalization
is
once
more
upon
us
is
once
again
grinding
out
its
propaganda
based
upon
the
high
cost
of
the
medical
program
to
the
taxpayer
they
the
offer
any
solution
other
than
outright
abolition
of
a
medical
system
unsurpassed
anywhere
in
the
world
veterans
acknowledge
the
fact
that
as
time
passes
the
demand
for
medical
care
at
hospitals
will
grow
proportionately
as

fosters
illness

approximately
five
million

matched
incidentally
by

there
have
been
moments
during

vitriolic
about

does
he

like
this

does
to

the

he
won

shorts
on
the
campus
seems
college
what
it
should
be
refer
to
the
attire
worn
by
the
students
a
visit
to
a
local
junior
college
last
week
was
shocked
to
see
the
young
ladies
wearing
short
shorts
and
the
young
men
wearing
shorts
this
what
our
children
are
to
come
face
to
face
with
when
they
are
ready
for
college
in
a
few
years
should
be
uppermost
in
their
minds
but
with
this
attire
how
can
anyone
think
it
is
so
looks
more
like
they
are
going
to
play
at
the
beach

further
asked
that

was
my
desire
to
advise
the

of

the
majority
of
polling
places
are
on
private
property
and
without
an
amendment
to

we
could
not
enforce
this

with

to
the

was
that
we
should
commend
those

who
serve
as
judges
of

and
who
properly
discharge
their
duty
and
polling
place
proprietors
who
make
available
their

not

criticize

no

the

reference
to
a
recent
suggestion
made
to
the
staff
of
the
of
registered
professional
nurses
with
college
background
and
varying
experiences
day
before
to
which
we
are
entitled
as
a
legal
holiday
we
were
informed
to
report
to
our
respective
polls
to
work
as
workers
of
the
party
ethical
and
professional
people
interested
in
community
health
and
we
felt
this
a
function
of
our
position
tactics
reek
of
totalitarianism
we
understand
this
directive
was
given
to
all
city
and
county
employes
our
knowledge
no
nurse
in
our
agency
has
been
employed
because
of
political
affiliation
therefore
considered
the
suggestion
an
insult
to
our
intelligence
ethics
of
only
obligation
for
this
day
is
to
vote
free
of
persuasion
for
the
person
we
feel
is
capable
in
directing
the
public
is
our
duty
not
as
nurses
or
city
employes
but
as
citizens
of
the
shelters
to
the
editor
read
of
a
man
who
felt
he
should
not
build
a
fallout
shelter
in
his
home
because
it
would
be
selfish
for
him
to
sit
secure
while
his
neighbors
had
no
shelters
this
man
live
in
a
neighborhood
where
all
are
free
loaders
unwilling
to
help
themselves
but
ready
to
demand
that
the
community
help
and
protect
them
shelters
are
of
course
necessary
for
those
having
no
space
for
shelter
in
a
town
of
private
homes
half
of
them
have
shelters
the
need
for
the
community
shelters
will
be
reduced
to
that
extent
designing
his
home
fallout
shelter
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
man
from
planning
to
shelter
that
occupants
so
he
will
be
able
to
take
in
a
stranger
hope
the
man
who
plans
to
sit
on
his
hands
until
the
emergency
comes
will
have
a
change
of
heart
will
get
busy
and
be
the
first
member
of
our
shelter
club
to
the

continue
to
inquire
the
reason
for
the
race
for
outer
space
simple
enough
from
my
point
of
view
am
for
it
is
the
only
method
left
for
a
man
to
escape
from
a
world
to
the

the
colonies

upon
freedom
from

insisted
through
the
of
that
the
nations
of
the
world
recognize
us
as
a
separate
political
entity
is
high
time
the
began
to
realize
that
the
rights
of
men
set
forth
in
that
document
are
applicable
today
to
the
the
right
of

also
an
essential
principle
again
applies
to
people
of
had
fought
for

obtained
their
freedom
from
the
yoke
of

his
cohorts
political
economic
geographic
and
natural
standards
they
were
justified
in
doing
so
and
the
denounce
their
own
principles
when
they
defend
the
oppressors
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
of
the
college
costs
to
the
editor
me
to
commend
your
editorial
in
which
you
stress
the
fact
that
a
program
of
county
colleges
will
substantially
increase
local
tax
burdens
and
that
taxpayers
have
a
right
to
a
clear
idea
of
what
such
a
program
would
commit
them
to
bill
which
passed
the
last
and
is
now
pending
in
the
should
be
given
careful
scrutiny
procedure
for
determining
the
amounts
of
money
to
be
spent
by
county
colleges
and
raised
by
taxation
will
certainly
startle
many
taxpayers
the
proposal
the
members
of
the
board
of
trustees
of
a
county
college
will
be
appointed
none
will
be
elected
trustees
will
prepare
an
annual
budget
for
the
college
and
submit
it
to
the
board
of
school
estimate
board
will
consist
of
two
of
the
trustees
of
the
college
and
the
director
and
two
members
of
the
board
of
freeholders
will
determine
the
amount
of
money
to
be
spent
by
the
college
and
will
certify
this
amount
to
the
board
of
freeholders
which
shall
appropriate
in
the
same
manner
as
other
appropriations
are
made
by
it
the
amount
so
certified
and
the
amount
shall
be
assessed
levied
and
collected
in
the
same
manner
as
moneys
appropriated
for
other
purposes
approval
of
only
three
members
of
the
board
of
school
estimate
is
required
to
certify
the
amount
of
money
to
be
allotted
to
the
college
two
of
these
could
be
trustees
of
the
college
actually
it
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
consent
of
only
one
elected
official
to
impose
a
levy
of
millions
of
dollars
of
tax
revenue
is
taxation
without
representation
improvements
to
the
editor
editorial
is
certainly
not
the
answer
to
our
slum
problems
very
rules
and
regulations
in
every
city
are
the
primary
case
of
slum
conditions
our
taxing
law
so
that
no
tax
shall
be
charged
to
any
owner
for
additions
or
improvements
to
his
properties
see
what
a
boom
in
all
trades
as
well
as
slum
clearance
at
no
cost
to
taxpayers
will
happen
entire
economy
will
have
a
terrific

that
that

up

hasten
to
join
in
praise
of
the
men
in
the
toll
booths
on

the
parkway
from

found
the
most
courteous
group
of
men
you
will
find
anywhere
even
gave
my
little
dog
a
biscuit
was
very
refreshing
viewers
of
the
at
and
have
an
added
attraction
the
view
of
a
fossilized
cypress
swamp
feet
below
the
street
level
in
the
excavation
of
the
new
motel
to
be
constructed
on
this
site
a
black
deposit
has
been
encountered
is
a
black
swamp
clay
in
which
about
one
hundred
million
years
ago
trees
were
growing
fossilized
remains
of
many
of
these
trees
are
found
embedded
in
the
clay
of
the
stumps
are
as
much
as
three
feet
long
but
most
of
them
have
been
flattened
by
the
pressure
of
the
overlying
sediments
the
wood
has
been
changed
to
coal
much
of
it
still
retains
its
original
cell
structure
the
clay
are
entombed
millions
of
pollen
grains
and
spores
which
came
from
plants
growing
in
the
region
at
the
time
microfossils
indicate
the
swamp
was
formed
during
the
period
when
dinosaurs
were
at
their
heyday
and
when
the
first
flowering
plants
were
just
appearing
deposit
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
nearby
famous
cypress
swamp
on
reported
in
which
was
probably
formed
during
the
second
interglacial
period
and
is
therefore
much
younger
for
peace
the
secretary
of
the
on
was
interviewed
on
the
air
respect
his
sincere
concern
for
peace
he
made
four
points
that
would
like
to
question
said
work
for
peace
instead
of
protection
from
aggression
would
ask
not
do
both
power
does
not
cause
war
war
is
the
result
of
mistrust
and
lack
of
understanding
between
people
we
not
late
especially
those
of
us
who
call
ourselves
in
doing
enough
about
this
lack
of
understanding
to
protection
the
speaker
disapproved
of
shelters
pointing
out
that
fallout
shelters
would
not
save
everyone
this
a
reason
for
saving
no
one
the
man
with
an
empty
life
boat
row
away
from
a
shipwreck
because
his
boat
could
not
pick
up
everyone
speaker
suggested
that
the
desolation
of
a
world
would
be
too
awful
to
face
the
world
comes
to
this
it
be
the
very
time
when
courage
and
would
be
needed
to
help
survivors
rebuild
of
our
young
people
think
it
would
the
speaker
decried
our
organized
program
of
emergency
help
calling
it
created
different
from
of
a
responsibility
of
the
at
all
levels
to
help
reduce
loss
of
life
and
property
in
disaster
natural
or
manmade
from
creating
fear
as
the
speaker
suggests
preparedness
knowing
what
to
do
in
an
emergency
gives
people
confidence
has
far
to
go
and
many
problems
to
solve
but
is
it
not
in
the
best
spirit
of
our
pioneer
tradition
to
be
not
only
willing
but
prepared
to
care
for
our
own
families
and
help
our
neighbors
in
any
disaster
storm
flood
accident
or
even
war
in
apartments
seems
rather
peculiar
that
residents
of
apartments
are
denied
the
right
of
providing
themselves
with
the
protection
and
companionship
of
dogs
feel
that
few
burglars
would
be
prone
to
break
and
enter
into
apartment
if
they
were
met
with
a
good
hardy
growl
that
a
dog
would
provide
addition
would
not
the
young
female
public
of
be
afforded
a
greater
degree
of
protection
at
night
when
they
are
on
the
streets
if
they
were
accompanied
by
a
dog
on
a
leash
grant
that
the
dog
may
not
be
really
protective
based
on
his
training
but
if
you
were
roaming
the
streets
looking
for
a
purse
to
snatch
or
a
young
lady
to
molest
how
quick
would
you
be
to
attack
a
person
strolling
with
a
dog
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
landlords
and
get
together
and
consider
liberalizing
the
practice
of
prohibiting
dogs
in
apartments

the
terraces
of

a
sidewalk
cafe
be
serious
in
his
proposal
nothing
in
this
country
more
sacred
than
the
comfort
the
idea
of
sidewalk
cafes
could
be
extended
and
are
rather
bleak
not
put
a
cafe
in
each
so
the
tourists
would
not
have
to
travel
too
far
to
eat
the
cafes
might
not
make
enough
money
to
support
themselves
during

obviously
a

most
of
us

to
be
able
to
sit
to
contemplate

be

more

fewer

the
first
time
in

the

is
dominated
by
two
large
powerful
nations
armed
with
murderous
nuclear

that
make
conventional
warfare
of
the
past
a
nullity
and
have
enough
nuclear

to
destroy
all

statements
by

regarding
the
destructive
power
of
the
newest
nuclear

and
the
deadly
should
be
sufficient
to
still
the
voices
of
those
who
advocate
nuclear

instead
of
negotiations
was
right
when
he
said
shall
never

out
of

and
we
never

have
just
returned

to

the
is
quite
evident
that
the
people
of

overwhelmingly
opposed
to

fact
is
that
the

know
that
they

no

as
they

that

sixteen

pray

not

one

with
many
thousands
killed
on
both

people
will
admit
that
bombs

rockets
of
destruction
are
frightening
whether
they
fall
on
or
is
why
the
was
formed
so
that
intelligent
men
with
good
intentions
from
all
countries
could
meet
and
solve
problems
without
resorting
to
war
has
showed
its
intentions
by
exploding
bombs
in
peace
time
to
try
to
frighten
the
world
the
expelled
from
the
tribute
to
the
editor
of
the
better
late
than
never
may
have
certain
merits
the
posthumous
award
of
the
for
to
the
late
strikes
me
as
less
than
a
satisfactory
expression
of
appreciation
it
been
bestowed
while
the
of
the
was
living
unquestionably
he
would
have
been
greatly
encouraged
in
pursuing
a
difficult
and
in
many
ways
thankless
task
to
one
report
however
was
considered
too
controversial
a
figure
to
warrant
bestowal
of
the
coveted
honor
last
spring
of
course
that
label
controversial
applied
only
because
he
was
carrying
out
the
mandate
given
him
by
the
world
organization
he
headed
rather
than
following
the
dictates
of
the
door
therefore
can
be
placed
the
primary
blame
but
also
at
fault
are
those
who
permitted
themselves
to
be
intimidated

one
of

to

a

today
to
bemoan
the
fact
that

those
who
would

seek
to
do
so
with
calisthenics
are
working
on
the
wrong
part
of
our

is
not
our

our
hearts
and
heads
that
have
grown
too
soft
of
our
wealth
and
power
afraid
of
world
opinion
and
addicted
to

we
have
allowed
our

we
become
firm
enough
to
stand
for
those
ideals
which
we
know
to
be
right
when
we
become
hard
enough
to
refuse
to
aid
nations
which
do
not
permit
when
we
become
strong
enough
to
resist
any
more
drifts
towards
socialism
in
our
own
when
we
recognize
that
our
enemy
is
not

and
when
we
realize
that

to

not
insure

his

some

he

unequivocally
the

less
significant

the

sweetheart

augmented

far
more

augmented
the

of

it

his

a

of

the
appropriate

as
a
symbolical
reminder
of
the
article
of
faith
that
governments
are
instituted
among
men
to
secure
to
them
certain
inalienable
rights
the
first
of
which
is
life
and
when
any
government
becomes
subversive
of
that
end
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
abolish
it
highway
system
is
an
agency
of
government
and
when
it
grinds
up
every
year
the
government
is
destroying
its
own
taxpayers
which
is
obviously
a
silly
thing
for
any
government
to
do
the
responsible
officials
would
not
abolish
the
government
but
would
emphasize
its
accountability
for
the
lives
of
its
individual
citizens
which
would
certainly
alter
it
and
definitely
for
the
better
the
salubrious
effects
would
not
be
exclusively
political
but
at
least
partially
and
perhaps
primarily
social
would
challenge
sharply
not
the
cult
of
the
motor
car
itself
but
some
of
its
ancillary
beliefs
and
practices
for
instance
the
doctrine
that
the
fulfillment
of
life
consists
in
proceeding
from
hither
to
yon
not
for
any
advantage
to
be
gained
by
arrival
but
merely
to
avoid
the
cardinal
sin
of
stasis
or
as
it
is
generally
termed
staying
put
the
adherents
of
staying
put
are
now
reduced
to
a
minor
even
a
miniscule
sect
and
their
credo
hearts
are
happiest
is
as
disreputable
as
although
few
in
number
they
are
a
stubborn
crew
as
tenacious
of
life
as
the
which
suggests
that
there
is
some
kind
of
vital
principle
embodied
in
their
faith
there
is
more
truth
than
we
are
wont
to
admit
in
the
conviction
of
that
ornament
of
grandfather
who
was
persuaded
that
the
great
curse
of
the
modern
world
is
all
this
any
event
the
yearly
sacrifice
of
victims
is
a
hecatomb
too
large
to
be
justified
by
the
most
ardent
faith
our
contemporary
must
be
induced
to
see
reason
appeals
to
morality
to
humanity
and
to
sanity
have
had
such
small
effect
perhaps
our
last
recourse
is
the
deterrent
example
we
make
it
established
custom
that
whenever
butchery
on
the
highways
grows
excessive
say
beyond
per
annum
then
somebody
is
going
to
hang
it
follows
that
the
more
eminent
the
victim
the
more
impressive
the
lesson
hang
might
be
preferable
except
that
they
are
not
directly
related
to
the

scientists
in

do
not

on
some
of
the
most
vital
points
at
least
publicly
the
one
hand
the
declared
as
recently
as
that
present
radiation
levels
resulting
from
the
shots
do
not
warrant
undue
public
concern
or
any
action
to
limit
the
intake
of
radioactive
substances
by
individuals
or
large
population
groups
anywhere
in
the
the
conceded
that
the
new
radioactive
particles
will
add
to
the
risk
of
genetic

in
succeeding
generations
and
possibly
to
the
risk
of
health
damage
to
some
people
in
the
it
added

not
possible
to
determine
how
extensive
these

how

its
bets
in
this
way
apparently
decided
it
would
be
possible
to
make
some
sort
of
determination
after
all
present
radiation
levels
and
even
at
somewhat
higher
levels
the
additional
risk
is
slight
and
very
few
people
will
be
affected
to
conclude
on
an
indeterminate
note
if
fallout
increased
substantially
or
remained
high
for
a
long
time
it
would
become
far
more
important
as
a
potential
health
hazard
in
this
country
and
throughout
the
world
a
winner
in
chemistry
has
been
less
ambiguous
whether
you
choose
to
agree
with
him
or
not
declaring
in
an
article
last
month
in
that
the
testing
carries
with
it
the
possibility
of
the
most
tragic
consequences
of
any
action
in
the
history
of
the
world
he
gave
this
estimate
of
the
biologic
and
genetic
consequences
if
the
new
shots
totaled
megatons
damage
to
human
germ
plasm
would
be
such
that
in
the
next
few
generations
children
around
the
world
would
be
born
with
gross
physical
or
mental
defects
from
the
fusion
process
would
cause
four
million
embryonic
neonatal
or
childhood
deaths
and
stillbirths
over
the
next
generations
and
between
and
one
million
human
beings
now
living
would
have
their
lives
cut
short
by
diseases
such
as
leukemia
of
these
would
be
in
the
where
the
fallout
is
concentrating
estimate
of
megatons
yield
from
the
present
series
of
tests
will
probably
turn
out
to
be
too
high
but
a
total
of
megatons
is
a
distinct
possibility
lack
of
scientific
unanimity
on
the
effects
of
radiation
is
due
in
part
to
insufficient
data
covering
large
population
groups
from
which
generalizations
could
be
drawn
more
than
one
conscientious
researcher
has
been
inhibited
from
completely
frank
discussion
of
the
available
evidence
by
the
less
excusable
fact
that
fallout
has
been
made
a
political
issue
as
well
as
a
scientific
problem
dangerous
effects
have
been
downgraded
to
the
public
by
some
who
believe
national
security
requires
further
testing
illustration
of
this
attitude
is
found
in
letter
to
reported
in
a
note
elsewhere
in
this
issue
of
this
day
the
shies
away
from
discussing
the
health
aspects
of
fallout
recent
study
on
radiation
exposure
by
the
division
of
biology
and
medicine
stated
question
of
the
biological
effect
of
radiation
doses
is
not
considered
herein
course
the
is
in
a
bind
now
it
comes
down
too
hard
on
the
potential
dangers
of
fallout
it
will
box
the
on
resuming
atmospheric
tests
the
announcements
of
the
new
shots
have
been
confined
to
one
or
two
bleak
sentences
with
the
fission
yield
usually
left
vague
of
course
that
the
are
the
nuclear
villains
radiation
is
a
nastier
word
than
it
was
in
the
mid
when
the
was
testing
in
the
atmosphere
prevailing
official
attitude
then
seemed
to
be
that
fallout
if
not
exactly
good
for
you
might
not
be
much
worse
than
a
bad
cold
a
nuclear
blast
one
bureaucrat
suggested
in
those
halcyon
days
about
all
you
had
to
do
was
haul
out
the
broom
and
sweep
off
your
sidewalks
and
roof
that
simple
anymore
if
gets
too
indignant
about
fallout
it
will
have
to
do
a
lot
of
fast
footwork
if
decides
it
too
must
start
pushing
up
the
radiation
count
much
fallout
will
we
get
of
the
had
reported
shots
in
the
new
series
of
them
in
a
megaton
range
including
a
super
bomb
with
a
yield
of
to
megatons
the
equivalent
of
million
to
million
tons
of
and
indicated
there
were
one
or
two
more
than
those
reported
the
lower
figure
for
the
big
blast
and
one
shot
estimated
by
the
at
megatons
a
conservative
computation
is
that
the
announced
tests
produced
a
total
yield
of
at
least
megatons
government
scientists
say
privately
that
the
figure
probably
is
closer
to
megatons
and
that
the
full
bomb
that
mentioned
may
still
be
detonated
the
new
series
has
followed
the
general
pattern
of
previous
tests
the
shots
were
roughly
half
fission
and
half
fusion
meaning
a
fission
yield
of
to
megatons
thus
far
this
must
be
added
the
to
megatons
of
fission
yield
produced
between
the
dawn
of
the
atomic
age
in
and
the
informal
test
moratorium
that
began
in
atmospheric
tests
of
the
inescapable
realities
of
the
is
that
it
has
thrust
upon
the
a
wholly
new
and
historically
unique
set
of
moral
dilemmas
first
dilemma
was
the
morality
of
nuclear
warfare
itself
dilemma
is
as
much
with
us
as
ever
second
great
dilemma
has
been
the
morality
of
nuclear
testing
a
dilemma
which
has
suddenly
become
acute
because
of
the
present
series
of
tests
this
second
dilemma
first
became
obvious
during
the
mid
to
late
the
appeared
to
have
three
choices
could
have
unilaterally
abandoned
further
testing
on
the
grounds
of
the
radiation
hazard
to
future
generations
could
have
continued
testing
to
the
full
on
the
grounds
that
the
radiation
danger
was
far
less
than
the
danger
of
world
domination
it
could
have
chosen
to
find
by
negotiation
some
way
of
stopping
the
tests
without
loss
to
national
security
third
choice
was
in
fact
made
the
resumption
of
testing
and
their
intransigence
at
the
talks
however
the
hope
that
this
third
choice
would
prove
viable
has
been
shaken
again
the
must
choose
once
again
the
choices
are
much
the
same
this
time
around
the
conditions
are
different
and
the
choice
is
far
harder
first
choice
abandoning
tests
entirely
would
not
only
be
unpopular
domestically
but
would
surely
be
exploited
by
the
second
choice
full
testing
has
become
even
more
risky
just
because
the
current
tests
have
already
dangerously
contaminated
the
atmosphere
third
choice
negotiation
presupposes
as
behavior
demonstrates
a
great
deal
of
wishful
thinking
to
make
it
appear
reasonable
take
the
position
however
that
the
third
choice
still
remains
the
only
sane
one
open
to
us
is
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
happy
choice
and
the
arguments
against
it
as
a
practical
strategy
are
formidable
primary
advantage
is
that
it
is
a
moral
choice
one
which
should
it
fail
will
not
have
contaminated
the
conscience
is
the
contamination
we
most
fear
aside
the
choice
of
unilateral
cessation
of
tests
as
neither
sane
nor
clearly
moral
the
question
must
arise
as
to
why
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
on
our
part
would
not
be
a
good
choice
that
is
the
one
an
increasingly
large
number
of
prominent
are
now
proposing
particular
has
expressed
as
cogently
and
clearly
as
anyone
the
case
for
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
recently
in
said
that
to
assure
the
sufficiency
of
our
own
weapons
in
the
face
of
the
recent
tests
we
are
now
clearly
compelled
to
conduct
our
own
nuclear
tests
account
of
the
fact
that
such
a
move
on
our
part
would
be
unpopular
in
world
opinion
he
argued
that
the
responsibility
of
the
is
to
do
confidently
and
firmly
not
what
is
popular
but
what
is
right
was
missing
in
the
argument
as
in
so
many
similar
arguments
was
a
premise
which
would
enable
one
to
make
the
ethical
leap
from
what
might
be
militarily
desirable
to
what
is
right
possibility
as
he
asserted
that
the
may
get
ahead
of
us
or
come
closer
to
us
because
of
their
tests
does
not
supply
the
needed
ethical
premise
unless
of
course
we
have
unwittingly
become
so
brutalized
that
nuclear
superiority
is
now
taken
as
a
moral
demand
the
lack
of
an
adequate
ethical
dimension
to
the
case
one
can
ask
seriously
whether
our
lead
over
the
in
quality
and
quantity
of
nuclear
weapons
is
so
slight
as
to
make
the
tests
absolutely
necessary
statements
by
the
and
spokesmen
have
to
the
contrary
assured
us
that
our
lead
is
very
great
the
and
the
have
been
deceiving
us
the
facts
do
not
support
the
assertion
that
we
are
compelled
to
resume
atmospheric
testing
is
perfectly
conceivable
that
a
resumption
of
atmospheric
tests
may
at
some
point
in
the
future
be
necessary
and
even
justifiable
a
resumption
does
not
seem
justifiable
now
we
need
to
realize
is
that
the
increasingly
great
contamination
of
the
atmosphere
by
the
tests
had
radically
increased
our
own
moral
obligations
now
have
to
think
not
only
of
our
national
security
but
also
of
the
future
generations
who
will
suffer
from
any
tests
we
might
undertake
is
an
ethical
demand
which
cannot
be
evaded
or
glossed
over
by
talking
exclusively
of
weapon
superiority
or
even
of
the
evil
of
often
in
the
past
tactics
have
been
used
to
justify
like
tactics
on
our
part
ought
to
be
a
point
beyond
which
we
will
not
allow
ourselves
to
go
regardless
of
what
does
refusal
to
resume
atmospheric
testing
would
be
a
good
start
hopes
when
his
first
called
for
an
and
at
the
same
time
voiced
his
yearning
for
unity
the
enthusiasm
among
and
ecumenicists
was
immediate
good
reason
it
appeared
that
a
new
day
was
upon
divided
as
the
more
concrete
plans
for
the
work
of
the
gradually
became
known
there
was
a
rather
sharp
and
abrupt
disappointment
on
all
sides
we
now
know
will
concern
itself
directly
only
with
the
internal
affairs
of
the
it
has
turned
out
however
the
excessive
enthusiasm
in
the
first
instance
and
the
loss
of
hope
in
the
second
were
both
wrong
responses
things
have
happened
in
recent
months
to
bring
the
into
perspective

a
basis
for
renewed
hope
and
joy
of
all
it

now
known
that
sees
the
renewal
and
purification
of

an
absolutely
necessary
step
toward

being
irrelevant

ecumenical
task

that
the
whole

may
see
in
the
best
possible
light

said
that
themselves
bear
some
responsibility
for
disunity
major
aim
of
the
will
be
to
remove
as
far
as
possible
whatever
in
the
today
stands
in
the
way
of
unity
a
whole
series
of
addresses
and
actions
by
the
and
by
others
show
that
concern
for
unity
is
still
very
much
alive
and
growing
within
the
establishment

the
of

permanent

the
most
dramatic
mark
of

of

more
dismaying
than

place
a
large
part
of
the
discrepancy
between

surplus
for

period
and
the

estimate
of
an
almost
seven

the
result
of
the
outgoing

to

budget

complaint
is
that
in
many
crucial
areas
the
programs
are
not
too
large
but
too
small

seriously
in

to
the

in
trying

introduction
of

principle
proved
strikingly
effective
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
for
in
the
last
weekend
in
of
the
principal
addresses
were
delivered
by
prominent
and
when
the
speaker
was
a
one
discussant
on
the

tended
to
be
of

persuasion
effects
were
immediately
evident
devoted

and
in
the

related
subjects
proved
to
be
much
livelier
under
this
procedure
than
if
were
merely
talking
to
themselves
questions
from
the
floor
were
directed
to
the
speaker
or
discussion
leader
the
earlier
sessions
there
was
plentiful
discussion
on
the
natural
law
which
of
advanced
as
the
basis
for
widely
acceptable
ethical
judgments
on
foreign
policy
principle
experienced
a
thorough
from
a
number
of
the
participants
but
in
the
end
the
concept
came
to
reassert
itself
declared
that
often
make
use
of
it
if
perhaps
by
some
other
name
told
about
its
existence
and
application
in
the
tradition
as
the
divine
law
while
a
member
who
has
been
working
in
close
association
with
delegates
of
the
new
nations
told
of
its
widespread
recognition
on
the
continent
impression
was
unmistakable
that
whatever
one
may
choose
to
call
it
natural
law
is
a
functioning
generality
with
a
certain
objective
existence
question
that
arose
was
the
nature
of
the
dialogue
itself
stimulus
from
the
confrontation
of
philosophical
systems
involving
certain
differences
was
undeniable
was
expected
that
the
comparison
of
different
approaches
to
ethics
would
produce
a
better
grasp
of
each
positions
and
better
comprehension
of
own
a
realization
that
each
group
has
much
of
substance
to
learn
from
the
other
also
developed
and
a
strong
conviction
grew
that
each
had
insights
and
dimensions
to
contribute
to
ethically
acceptable
solutions
of
urgent
political
issues
effect
of
the
spirited
of
these
discussions
was
to
focus
attention
on
practical
applications
and
the
necessity
of
being
armed
with
the
facts
knowledge
of
the
destructive
force
of
even
the
tiniest
tactical
atomic
weapon
would
have
a
bearing
on
judgments
as
to
the
advisability
of
its
use
to
defend
for
example
the
pervasive
influence
of
ideology
on
our
political
judgments
needs
to
be
recognized
and
taken
into
due
account
it
is
necessary
to
perceive
the
extent
of
foreign
aid
demanded
by
the
imperative
went
in
asked
the
same
question
was
searching
for
an
accent
of
or
even
of
hypocrisy
never
found
it
among
any
of
the
with
whom
spoke
though
granted
they
were
almost
all
members
of
the
official
family
who
presumably
harbor
official
thoughts
questioned
also
professional
soldiers
who
would
not
easily
be
hypnotized
by
a
dreamy
irredentism
answer
was
it
can
be
done
and
we
will
do
it
then
put
the
question
as
pointedly
as
could
directly
to
said
practically
no
one
believes
that
you
subjectively
intend
to
the
evidence
is
there
of
an
objective
kind
that
in
fact
your
government
proposes
to
do
just
that
and
that
it
can
be
done

always

at

at
visitors

smiled
also
at
a
bloke
seated
next
to
me
who
asked
the
most
asinine
questions
recalled
sympathetically
the
complaint
in

and
said
a
word
or
two
to
the
interpreter
who
turned
to
me
wonders
where
you
are
going
after
you
leave
smarted
is
a
royal
rebuff
if
ever
there
was
one
answered
the
routine
question
about
my
itinerary
rather
coolly
spoke
again
this
time
at
greater
length
says
the
translator
came
in
that
the
reason
he
asked
you
where
you
were
going
is
because
he
hoped
you
would
be
visiting
other
areas
in
and
that
everywhere
you
went
you
would
seek
the
answer
to
your
question
says
that
if
he
were
to
express
to
you
once
again
his
own
profound
determination
to
go
to
the
and
his
faith
that
that
return
is
feasible
he
would
merely
sound
redundant
you
yourself
must
seek
these
objective
data
and
come
to
your
own
conclusions
information
we
have
here
in
is
at
your
disposal
enough
are
the
relevant
data
every
person
on
there
are
sixty
in
the
raw
population
figures
are
crucially
relevant
then
it
is
idle
to
think
of
liberation
as
idle
as
to
suppose
that
might
liberate
military
manpower
than
but
at
least
estimates
vary
widely
on
the
strength
of
the
army
four
million
armed
forces
of
are
at
a
working
strength
of
about
though
a
reserve
potential
twice
that
high
is
contemplated
is
generally
conceded
that
the
air
force
is
the
best
by
far
in
and
the
army
the
best
trained
morale
is
very
high
so
it
adds
up
to
impossible
odds
except
that
the
question
arises
whose
side
would
the
army
fight
miserable
people
of
the
largest
cast
ever
conscripted
to
enact
an
ideological
passion
play
cannot
themselves
resist
overtly
think
perforce
of
physical
survival
everything
else
is
secondary
the
army
which
continues
to
feed
well
where
are
its
sympathies
psychological
strategists
in
stress
the
great
sense
of
family
cultivated
in
over
thousands
of
years
has
not
been
extirpated
by
ten
years
of
depersonalization
soldier
in
the
army
has
somewhere
relatives
who
are
close
to
starvation
soldiers
themselves
cannot
stage
a
successful
rebellion
it
is
assumed
but
will
their
discontent
spread
to
the
officer
class
immediate
families
of
the
generals

the
admirals
are
well
fed
a
despot
does
not
economize
on
his

there
are

most
definitely
there
there
must
be
a
catalytic
pressure
military
in
believe
that
the
have
made
two
mistakes
which
together
may
prove
fatal
first
was
the
commune
program
which
will
ensure
agricultural
poverty
for
years
family
is
largely
broken
up
and
where
it
is
not
it
is
left
with
no
residue
and
the
social
meaning
of
this
is
enormous
it
is
the
family
that
in
has
always
provided
social
security
for
the
indigent
the
sick
the
members
of
the
clan
the
government
must
do
that
but
the
government
is
left
with
no
reserve
granary
under
the
agricultural
system
it
has
ordained
the
government
simultaneously
undertook
the
vast
burden
of
social
security
which
had
traditionally
been
privately
discharged
and
created
a
national
scarcity
which
has
engendered
calamitous
problems
of
social
security
second
mistake
is
has
historically
served
as
a
buffer
state
friendly
state
sometimes
only
but
never
hostile
never
tried
to
integrate
by
extirpating
the
religion
and
institutions
is
trying
to
do
this
and
she
is
not
likely
ever
to
succeed
is
too
vast
the
terrain
is
too
difficult
may
bleed
as
is
bleeding
continuing
pressures
social
economic
and
military
are
doing
much
to
keep
in
a
heightening
state
of
tension
imposition
of
yet
another
pressure
a
strong
one
from
the
outside
might
cause
it
to
snap
planners
in
struck
me
as
realistic
men
know
that
they
must
depend
heavily
on
factors
outside
their
own
control
and
foremost
they
depend
on
the
inhuman
idiocies
of
the
regime
these
they
feel
they
can
rely
they
depend
on
moral
cooperation
when
the
crucial
moment
arrives
hope
that
if
history
vouchsafes
the
another
we
will
receive
the
opportunity
gladly
remarked
jocularly
to
the
that
the
future
of

be
far
more
certain
if
he
would
invite
a
planeload
of
selected

an
odd
day
affected
most
properly
not
to
understand
my
point
he
and
all
of
wears
the
scars
of
indecisiveness
and
he
knows
what
an
uncertain
ally
we
are
have
been
grand
to
itself
lots
of
aid
and
most
of
the
time
a
policy
of
support
for
the
offshore
islands
our
outlook
has
been
and
continues
to
be
defensive
great
deal
depends
on
the
crystallization
of
views
on
the
world

that
the
situation
on
the
is
in
flux
and
are
poised
to
strike
is
not
anywhere
on
the
frontiers
of
freedom
a
more
highly
mobilized
force
for
liberation
moment
of
truth
is
the
moment
of
crisis
the
slow
buildup
the
essence
of
a
policy
or
a
man
is
concealed
under
embroidered
details
fine
words
strutting
gestures
crisis
burns
these

away
the
truth
is
open
to
eyes
that
are
willing
to
look

passes
rags
are
hurriedly
tossed
on
the

crisis
erupted
in
for
a
couple
of
days
this
month
to
be
quickly
smothered
by
the
high
pressure
verbal
fog
that
is
kept
on

for
such
emergencies

us
make
a
note
or
two
of
what

instantly
taken

cases
of
public
men
at
many
levels

better
now
who
has
bone
and
who
has
jelly
in
his
spine
am
here
concerned
more
with
policy
than
with
men
men
come
and
go
but
great
issues
of
policy
remain
everyone
knows
or
knew
in
the
week
of
that
something
had
gone
shockingly
wrong
with
foreign
policy
was
engaged
in
a
military
attack
on
a
peaceful
orderly
people
governed
by
a
regime
that
had
proved
itself
the
most
and
within
any
of
the
new
nations
the
only
place
in
moreover
where
a
productive
relationship
between
whites
and
blacks
had
apparently
been
achieved

the
fighting
was
officially
under
the
auspices
of
the
in
the
moment
of
truth
everyone
could
see
that
the
was
in
reality
the
principal
moment
simultaneously
revealed
that
in
the
crisis
our
policy
ran
counter
to
that
of
all
our
allies
to
the
entire
community
our
policy
the
was
is
split
the
key
revelation
is
not
new
controlling
pattern
was
first
displayed
in
the
crisis
of
reappears
in
whole
or
part
whenever
a
new
crisis
exposes
the
reality
in
last
spring
with
which
the
events
of
last
month
should
be
paired
at
the
peaks
of
the
nuclear
test
and
the
cycles
in
relation
to
right
now
with
almost
cartoon
emphasis
in
the
temporally
linked
complex
of
the
moments
reveal
prime
element
of
the
truth
may
be
stated
as
follows
prevailing
policy
the
can
take
the
initiative
against
the
but
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
makes
no
difference
what
part
of
the
world
is
involved
what
form
of
regime
what
particular
issue
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
is
even
some
question
whether
the
can
any
longer
defend
itself
against
an
initiative
by
the

attack
but
not

that

that
it
is
his

that

that

stand
supinely
bleating
while

smash
into
a
district
of
our

explains
this
paralysis
is
the
consequence
of
the
system
of
ideas
that
constitutes
the
frame
of
our
international
and
in
some
degree
our
domestic
policy
crisis
proves
that
this
system
was
not
invented
by
the
new
but
only
made
more
consistent
and
more
active
to
the
puzzles
immediately
relevant
to
these
episodes
in
and
as
to
the
crisis
before
them
is
the
belief
that
the
main
theater
of
the
world
drama
is
the
underdeveloped
region
of
and
this
belief
is
derived
the
practical
orientation
of
our
policy
on
the
uncommitted
neutralist
contested
nations
especially
on
those
whose
leaders
make
the
most
noise
chief
aim
becomes
that
of
finding
favor
in
neutralist
eyes
we
grasp
this
orientation
as
a
key
our
national
conduct
in
all
of
the
events
here
mentioned
becomes
intelligible
it
becomes
clear
why
in
general
we
cannot
take
the
initiative
against
the
the
unoriginals
write
a
play
the
dramatist
once
needed
an
idea
plus
the
imagination
the
knowledge
of
life
and
the
craft
to
develop
it
more
and

all
he
needs

so
many
of
his

was
not
the
only
thing
that
kept
the
public
at
bay
his
view
of
the
world
was
one
of
almost
unrelieved
tragedy
and
it
was
too
much
even
for
was
obsessed
by
disease
and
poverty
by
the
melancholy
of
old
age
and
the
tyranny
of
lust
children
he
painted
were
almost
always
in
rags
his
portraits
were
often
ruthless
to
the
point
of
ugliness
and
his
nudes
including
several
were
stringy
contorted
and
strangely
pathetic
subject
he
liked
most
was
the
female
body

he
painted
in

state

muffled
to
the
ears
sitting
primly
in
a
chair
lying
tauntingly
on
a
bed
or
locked
in
an
embrace
most
surprising
thing
about
the
of
the
is
that
it
is
surprising
perhaps
quite
as
much
in
its
own
way
as
the
of
which
ended
with
that
famous
secret
report
on
publication
last
of
the
that
blueprint
for
the
transition
to
communism
had
led
the
uninitiated
to
suppose
that
this
would
be
a
sort
of
apotheosis
of
the
regime
a
solemn
consecration
of
ideas
which
had
in
fact
been
current
over
the
last
three
or
four
years
since
the
defeat
of
the
group
in
all
theoretical
party
journals
never
ceased
to
suggest
that
if
in
the
eyes
of
and
full
communism
was
still
a
very
distant
ideal
the
establishment
of
a
society
had
now
under
become
an
immediate
and
tangible
reality
seems
that
himself
took
a
very
special
pride
in
having
made
a
contribution
to
doctrine
with
his
a
large
part
of
his
speech
at
the
recent
was
in
fact
very
largely
a
rehash
of
that
interminable
document
and
other
leaders
responsible
for
the
document
were
proud
of
having
brought
forward
some
new
formulas
such
as
the
early
replacement
of
the
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
by
an
and
also
of
having
laid
down
the
lines
for
a
much
greater
democratization
of
the
whole
hierarchy
of
starting
with
the
itself
plan
for
rotation
of
leaders
promised
a
salutary
blow
at
bureaucracy
and
would
enable
the
people
to
take
a
more
direct
and
active
part
in
running
the
country
elections
would
be
more
democratic
there
might
even
be
two
or
more
candidates
for
voters
to
choose
from
doubt
there
was
still
a
lot
in
the
and
in
speech
which
left
many
points
obscure
it
the
intention
for
example
to
abolish
gradually
the
kolkhoz
system
and
replace
it
by
uniformly
kolkhozes
state
farms
which
were
moreover
to
be
progressively
urbanized
we
know
the
peasant
today
still
very
largely
thrives
on
being
able
to
sell
the
produce
grown
on
his
private
plot
and
it
is
still
very
far
from
certain
how
valid
the
claim
is
that
in
a
growing
number
of
kolkhozes
the
peasants
are
finding
it
more
profitable
to
surrender
their
private
plots
to
the
kolkhoz
and
to
let
the
latter
be
turned
into
something
increasingly
like
a
state
farm
one
follows
the
reports
of
the
one
finds
that
there
still
seems
considerable
uncertainty
in
the
minds
of
the
leaders
themselves
about
what
exactly
to
do
in
this
matter
was
interesting
in
other
respects
too
contained
for
example
a
number
of
curious
admissions
about
the
peasants
who
enjoy
no
sickness
benefits
no
pensions
no
paid
holidays
they
still
benefit
far
less
than
the
other
per
cent
of
the
nation
from
that
welfare
state
which
the
so
greatly
prides
itself
on
being
all
these
fairly
awkward
problems
was
to
skate
rather
lightly
and
though
he
repeated
over
and
over
again
the
spectacular
figures
of
industrial
and
agricultural
production
in
the
ordinary
people
in
are
still
a
little
uncertain
as
to
how
communism
is
really
going
to
work
in
practice
especially
in
respect
of
food
agriculture
progress
as
rapidly
as
industry
was
something
on
which
himself
seemed
to
have
some
doubts
for
he
kept
on
threatening
that
he
would
pull
the
ears
of
those
responsible
for
agricultural
production
as
we
know
the
are
not
producing
as
much
as
had
hoped
cannot
but
wonder
whether
these
doubts
about
the
success
of
agricultural
policy
have
not
at
least
something
to
do
with
one
of
the
big
surprises
provided
by
this
the
obsessive
harping
on
the
crimes
and
misdeeds
of
the
group
and
others
including
the
in
particular
is
being
charged
with
all
kinds
of
sins
especially
with
wanting
to
cut
down
free
public
services
to
increase
rents
and
fares
in
fact
with
having
been
against
all
the
more
popular
features
of
the
welfare
state
trouble
with
all
these
doctrinal
quarrels
is
that
we
hear
only
one
side
of
the
story
what
in
the
secret
councils
of
the
had
really
proposed
we
just
know
and
he
has
had
no
chance
to
reply
one
cannot
escape
the
suspicion
that
all
this
harping
on
the
misdeeds
of
the
long
liquidated
group
would
be
totally
unnecessary
if
there
were
not
inside
the
party
some
secret
but
genuine
opposition
to
on
vital
doctrinal
grounds
on
the
actual
methods
to
be
employed
in
the
transition
to
communism
and
last
but
not
least
on
foreign
policy
whole
problem
of
peaceful
coexistence
and
peaceful
competition
with
the
capitalist
world
is
in
the
very
center
of
this
declared
altogether
rejects
the
line
of
peaceful
coexistence
reducing
this
concept
merely
to
the
state
of
peace
or
rather
the
absence
of
war
at
a
given
moment
and
to
a
denial
of
the
possibility
of
averting
a
world
war
views
in
fact
coincide
with
those
of
foreign
enemies
of
peaceful
coexistence
who
look
upon
it
merely
as
a
variant
of
the
cold
war
or
of
an
armed
peace
cannot
help
wondering
whether
and
the
rest
of
the
group
are
not
being
used
as
by
and
his
faithful
followers
something
clearly
has
gone
very
very
seriously
wrong
in
relations
which
were
never
easy
and
have
now
deteriorated
effect
of
clash
with
together
with
the
everlasting
attacks
on
has
shifted
the
whole
attention
of
the
world
including
that
of
the
people
from
the
program
to
the
present
conflict
only
as
we
know
did
publicly
treat
attack
on
as
something
that
we
cannot
consider
as
a
serious
approach
to
the
problem
as
something
thoroughly
dictatorial
and
undemocratic
but
the
leaders
went
out
of
their
way
to
be
openly
abusive
to
calling
him
a
liar
a
bully
and
so
on
is
extremely
doubtful
that
the
handful
of
who
call
themselves
could
have
done
this
without
the
direct
approval
of
their
friends
big
question
is
whether
in
the
name
of
a
restored
solidarity
the
will
choose
to
persuade
the
to
present
their
humble
apologies
to
or
get
rid
of
seem
about
the
only
two
ways
in
which
the
unhappy
incident
can
now
be
closed
is
merely
a
symptom
of
a
real
malaise
between
and
are
other
symptoms
for
all
his
bombastic
prophecies
about
the
inevitable
decay
of
capitalism
is
genuinely
favorable
to
peaceful
coexistence
and
would
like
above
all
the
and
problems
to
be
settled
peacefully
he
knows
that
he
was
never
more
popular
than
at
the
time
of
the
honeymoon
of
it
seems
that
pressures
against
him
are
coming
from
somewhere
in
the
first
place
from
but
perhaps
also
from
that
which
was
assured
in
nearly
two
years
ago
exists
on
the
quiet
inside
the
party
these
people
solidarity
and
unity
with
should
be
the
real
basis
of
future
policy
the
as
the
incident
shows
have
strong
suspicions
that
is
anxious
to
secure
a
shameful
peace
with
the
fact
that
which
is
obsessed
by
to
a
very
small
matter
should
be
supported
by
and
is
highly
indicative
one
cannot
but
wonder
whether
who
was
blowing
hot
and
cold
exalting
peace
but
also
almost
openly
considering
the
possibility
of
preventive
war
against
the
trying
to
keep
the
quiet
this
brings
us
inevitably
to
the
or
bomb
not
this
dropped
primarily
in
order
to
appease
the
especially
after
humiliating
surrender
to
the
in
canceling
the
deadline
of

it
all
add
up
to
are
that
and
with
him
the
bulk
of
the
people
favor
peaceful
coexistence
and
with
the
exception
of
the
maintenance
of
the
status
quo
in
the
world
and
on
the
other
hand
feel
that
militarily
is
strong
enough
to
support
them
in
the
just
wars
of
liberation
they
would
like
to
embark
on
before
long
with
attacking
and
the
and
liberating
the
southern
half
of
their
respective
countries
is
in
a
more
difficult
position
than
any
since
when
the

enough
inside

if

up

he
is
going

the
most
agonizing
choice
in
his
life

he
may
break

would
be
infernally
difficult
and
perhaps
disastrous
or
he
may
succeed
by
all
kinds
of
dangerous
concessions
in
persuading
to
be
patient
next
days
may
show
where
things
stand
a
misty
morning
last
month
a
small
band
of
militant
called
the
held
maneuvers
in
a
foggy
field
about
fifteen
miles
east
of
here
men
a
woman
and
a
boy
tramped
over
cold
damp
ground
during
a
field
drill
in
the
problems
of
guerrilla
warfare
the
average
this
must
sound
like
an
incredible
tale
from
a
night
movie
to
the
this
is
a
serious
business
feel
that
the
is
engaged
in
a
struggle
with
communism
for
survival
and
world
supremacy
feel
that
has
already
begun
and
they
are
setting
themselves
up
as
a
last
line
of
defense
against
the
advance
national
leader
of
says
the
believe
that
guerrilla
tactics
are
best
suited
to
defeat
the
onslaught
their
maneuvers
last
month
they
wore
camouflage
garb
and
helmets
and
carried
unloaded
rifles
maneuvers
were
held
in
secret
after
a
regional
seminar
for
the
held
in
nearby
had
been
broken
up
the
previous
day
by
deputy
sheriffs
who
had
arrested
regional
leader
of
and
seized
four
operative
weapons
including
a
machine
gun
two
automatic
rifles
and
an
rifle
by
this
contretemps
a
small
band
of
the
faithful
gathered
at
home
at
the
next
day
put
on
their
uniforms
and
headed
for
a
farm
several
miles
away
mortar
and
a
recoilless
rifle
owned
by
were
brought
along
mortar
was
equipped
with
dummy
shells
and
the
recoilless
rifle
was
deactivated
a
tortuous
drive
in
an
open
truck
and
a
army
jeep
down
soggy
trails
the
band
arrived
at
a
small
clearing
squeezed
between
a
long
low
ridge
and
a
gully
the
two
leaders
and
hastened
to
put
the
group
through
its
paces
were
instructed
in
the
use
of
terrain
for
concealment
were
shown
how
to
advance
against
an
enemy
outpost
atop
a
cleared
ridge
practiced
movement
behind
a
smoke
screen
laid
by
smoke
grenades
and
they
attempted
a
skirmish
line
of
advance
against
a
camouflaged
enemy
encampment
dummy
rounds
were
fired
by
in
a
demonstration
of
mortar
shooting
the
mother
of
five
children
and
an
active
member
of
her
organization
participated
in
all
the
exercises
were
no
casualties
but
the
guerrillas
admitted
to
being
a
little
tired
when
the
leaders
called
a
halt
at
to
enable
members
to
catch
a
plane
as
criterion
would
like
to
add
one
more
practical
reform
to
those
mentioned
by
has
to
do
with
salaries
and
tenure
after
receiving
a
degree
from
of
in
will
be
teaching
somewhere
that
much
is
guaranteed
by
the
present
shortage
of
mathematics
teachers
will
also
be
underpaid
amazing
thing
is
that
this
too
is
caused
by
the
dearth
of
teachers
is
at
present
a
market
as
a
result
buyers
the
public
must
be
satisfied
with
teachers
this
is
not
the
real
problem
the
rub
arises
from
the
fact
that
teachers
are
usually
paid
on
the
basis
of
time
served
rather
than
quality
all
teachers
good
and
bad
who
have
been
teaching
for
a
given
number
of
years
are
paid
the
same
salary
am
firmly
convinced
that
considering
the
average
quality
of
teachers
in
this
country
the
profession
is
grossly
overpaid
follows
that
teachers
as
a
group
cannot
expect
any
marked
salary
increases
there
is
a
limit
to
how
much
the
public
will
pay
for
shoddy
performance
only
hope
which
good
teachers
have
for
being
paid
their
due
is
to
stop
dragging
the
dead
weight
of
poor
teachers
up
the
economic
ladder
with
them
only
hope
which
the
public
has
for
getting
good
teachers
is
to
pay
teachers
on
the
basis
of
merit
rather
than
tenure
as
in
all
sectors
of
the
economy
quality
and
justice
are
both
dependent
on
the
right
of
the
individual
to
deal
directly
with
his
employer
if
he
so
chooses
of
initiative
the
eve
of
the
great
debate
on
the
proposal
to
give
the
broad
powers
to
make
tariff
concessions
which
could
practically
bring
us
into
the
we
should
face
the
alternatives
on
this
proposition
we
will
be
sacrificing
in
any
such
arrangement
will
be
our
power
to
be
selective
which
is
contained
in
the
reciprocal
trade
principle
under
which
we
now
operate
this
power
we
lay
open
any
industry
which
the
may
find
it
economically
profitable
to
destroy
to
the
will
of
others
is
this
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
economy
which
may
lead
to
the
loss
of
initiative
in
how
we
conduct
our
political
affairs
brief
for
the
negative
disagree
with

on

a
desirable
organization
for
us
to
join

to
ignore
the
political
consequences

in
an
of

difficult
to

for
our

we
will
proceed

very
convincing
to
those
who
do
not

we

think
that
we
can
merely
relinquish

without
giving
up

it

not

that
all
of

are
advocating

refer
you
to
an
article
in
the
magazine
section
by
entitled
says
has
swept
aside
petty
nationalisms
rivalries
and
customs
to
he
says
see
a
nation
that
traditionally
values
sovereignty
above
all
else
willing
to
give
up
its
economy
placing
this
authority
in
hands
the
goal
of
our
international
planners
is
a
this
would
mark
a
giant
step
in
that
direction
for
once
economic
autonomy
is
absorbed
a
larger
grouping
is
a
question
of
time
it
is
being
very
cleverly
done
for
in
a
sense
they
have
us
over
a
barrel
to
what
has
to
say
the
savage
wounds
that
isolationism
would
inflict
would
lose
our
export
markets
and
deny
ourselves
the
imports
we
need
would
be
crippled
by
reduced
output
industrial
decline
widespread
unemployment
the
solution
to
this
dilemma
is
not
the
incorporation
of
the
into
an
or
economic
empire
but
merely
what
libertarians
like
and
have
been
arguing
for
years
an
end
to
government
regulations
an
end
to
government
competition
in
industry
and
a
realistic
depreciation
allowance
for
industry
a
free
market
here
give
us
a
sound
money
system
and
compete
with
anyone
and
combined
short
get
this
governmental
monstrosity
off
our
backs
and
we
have
to
worry
about
competition
or
either
we
want
to
preserve
our
sovereignty
this
is
the
way
to
do
it
not
acquiesce
to
an
international
planning
board
we
go
into
this
we
might
just
as
well
stop
talking
about
guarantees
or
for
that
matter
conservatism
in

few

your

me
this

that
should

grotesquely
ironic
considering
the
character
of

in
his
accretion

absolute

defeating

once
again
the
end
of
the
divine
right

seems
to
me
that
in
his
editorial
has
hit
upon
the
real
problem
that
bothers
all
of
us
in
a
complex
world
how
do
we
retain
our
personal
relationship
with
those
who
suffer
affects
us
all
intimately

can
leave
us
hopeless
in
the

know
of
no
other
solution
than
the
one
proposes
to
do
what
we
can
for
each
sufferer
as
he
confronts
us
hoping
that
this
will
spread
beyond
him
to
others
at
some
time
and
some
place
have
seen
this
expressed
so
clearly
and
so
sympathetically
you
for
the
illustrated
editorial
is
both
great
writing
and
profound
religion
has
said
something
important
so
well
that
this
preacher
will
many
times
be
tempted
to
quote
the
whole
piece
feel
that
hit
the
very
core
of
our
existence
in
the
editorial
it
meant
a
great
deal
my
only
hope
is
that
it
will
be
shared
by
many
many
others
should
fortify
us
all
whether
in
or
the
to
for
successfully
delving
into
the
heart
of
the
problems
that
face
the
concur
that
it
is
necessary
for
to
have
a
confrontation
of
the
situation
existing
in
foreign
lands
would
be
heartbreaking
to
see
idealism
and
hence
effective
leadership
thwarted
by
the
poverty
and
hardship
which
young
will
run
into
editorial
was
certainly
direct
in
its
appeal
to
those
of
us
living
here
in
personally
gained
strength
from
it
for
continuing
to
capture
the
attention
and
uncover
so
many
areas
of
need
in
this
amazing
world
editorial
is
a
stunning
piece
of
writing
would
hope
that
will
encourage
everyone
entering
the

read
it
important
people
to
humanity
are
not
the

but
the

the

them
whose

we
will
never

note
of

be
included
among
the
material
to

the

as
precisely
the
message
we
need
to
communicate
to
the
men
and
women
who
will
soon
be
volunteers
article
in
issue
seemed
to
be
a
very
fair
and
objective
analysis
of
the
certainly
hope
this
will
be
the
impression
left
in
the
minds
of
readers
rather
than
the
comment
by
in
his
first
of
the
month
column
is
blind
fundamentalist
dogmatism
to
say
around
with
the
version
seems
to
us
a
perilous
sport
at
best
in
focus
is
on
the
right
track
in
his
article
current
stereotype
of
straight
news
reporting
was
probably
invaluable
in
protecting
the
press
and
its
readers
from
pollution
by
that
combination
of
doctored
fact
fancy
and
personal
opinion
called
yellow
journalism
which
flourished
in
this
country
more
than
a
generation
ago
need
this
type
of
protection
any
more
public
is
now
armed
with
sophistication
and
numerous
competing
media
there
are
no
longer
enough
corruptible
journalists
about
accepted
method
of
writing
news
has
two
major
liabilities
it
does
not
communicate
reporter
restricted
to
the
competing
propaganda
statements
of
both
sides
in
a
major
labor
dispute
for
instance
is
unable
to
tell
his
readers
half
of
what
he
knows
about
the
causes
of
the
dispute
it
subjects
the
news
to
distortion
by
the
unscrupulous
charges
by
the
late
junior
from
not
only
destroyed
innocent
people
but
misled
the
nation
the
press
was
powerless
to
put
these
charges
in
perspective
in
its
news
columns
several
years
of
stories
the
average
citizen
was
unable
to
get
a
complete
picture
of
until
he
saw
on
the
television
screen
what
the
reporters
had
been
seeing
all
along
but
had
no
effective
way
of
communicating
had
boxed
them
in
with
their
own
restrictions
seems
to
me
the
time
has
come
for
the
press
to
start
experimenting
with
ways
of
reporting
the
news
that
will
do
a
better
job
of
communicating
and
will
be
less
subject
to
abuse
by
those
who
have
learned
how
to
manipulate
the
present
stereotype
to
serve
their
own
ends
objective
should
be
to
provide
a
method
of
getting
into
print
a
higher
percentage
than
is
now
possible
of
the
relevant
information
in
the
possession
of
reporters
and
editors
blackout
would
like
to
see
you
devote
some
space
in
an
early
issue
to
the
news
blackout
concerning
activities
so
far
as
is
concerned
have
on
more
than
one
occasion
praised
the
idea
of
a
televised
press
conference
and
the
chance
it
gives
the
people
to
form
intelligent
opinions
begin
with
the
does
not
publish
a
transcript
of
these
press
conferences
am
sure
that
they
did
when
was
because
of
the
time
differential
the
conferences
come
on
the
networks
during
the
middle
of
the
day
until
now
the
networks
have
grudgingly
run
tapes
at
or
sometimes
or
then
a
few
of
the
less
interesting
questions
are
edited
out
and
glibly
summarized
by
a
commentator
last
night
the
tapes
were
not
run
at
all
during
the
evening
hours
and
all
we
got
on
were
a
few
snatches
which
and
and
could
squeeze
into
their
programs
is
no
criticism
of
them
as
they
obviously
cannot
get
a
program
into
a
news
summary
radio
stations
did
run
transcripts
thought
during
the
evening
hours
by
comparing
the
snatches
two
different
radio
station
and
the
censored
version
found
that
the
radio
stations
had
edited
out
questions
removed
the
one
regarding
or
even
a
paragraph
out
of
the
middle
of
the
answer
am
interested
to
know
he
is
getting
mail
from
all
over
the
country
about
the
abuse
he
is
being
subjected
to
out
here
see
enough
of
the
conference
to
know
he
is
being
abused
know
if
this
is
the
situation
in
other
parts
of
the
country
apparently
it
is
not
also
happened
with
the
which
was
not
at
all
during
the
evening
hours
and
wrote
to
the
editor
of
the
did
mention
in
his
column
the
fact
that
he
had
received
many
letters
about
this
and
he
himself
did
not
understand
the
networks
and
the
independent
local
not
doing
this
but
nothing
happened
you
bring
the
attention
to
this
a
college
of
propaganda
was
interested
in
column
in
which
he
raised
the
question
a
of
my
estimation
we
definitely
do
and
the
sad
part
of
it
is
that
we
had
one
which
was
rounding
into
excellent
shape
and
we
let
it
disintegrate
and
die
the
war
we
set
up
schools
for
the
teaching
of
psychological
warfare
which
included
the
teaching
of
propaganda
both
black
and
white
and
the
various
shades
of
grey
in
between
had
a
couple
of
schools
in
this
country
the
principal
one
being
on
the
estate
out
in
were
also
a
couple
in
and
several
in
schools
preceded
ours
and
by
the
time
we
got
into
it
they
had
learned
a
lot
about
the
techniques
of
propaganda
and
its
teaching
of
us
here
in
the
attended
first
as
students
then
as
instructors
almost
every
one
of
these
schools
in
and
the
set
up
the
school
worked
out
its
curriculum
and
taught
there
the
end
of
the
war
we
really
felt
that
we
had
learned
something
about
propaganda
and
how
to
teach
it
the
end
did
come
and
the
schools
were
disbanded
and
abandoned
we
felt
and
hoped
that
the
machinery
of
psychological
warfare
would
not
be
allowed
to
rust
hoped
that
its
practitioners
and
teachers
might
be
put
on
some
sort
of
reserve
list
and
called
back
for
refresher
courses
each
year
or
so
no
such
thing
happened
apparently
is
no
school
of
propaganda
or
psychological
warfare
study
at
the
and
at
the
service
academies
revealed
that
nothing
was
being
done
there
not
one
of
the
four
men
who
attended
all
the
schools
has
ever
been
called
on
to
apply
any
of
his
knowledge
in
any
way
on
the
article
is
one
of
the
most
constructive
suggestions
made
in
this
critical
field
in
years
and
certainly
hope
it
sparks
some
action
the
media
clean
house
too
many
of
us
in
public
relations
were
flattered
that
chose
to
devote
his
editorial
in
the
to
the
merger
of
the
of
and
the
storm
was
surprised
and
sorry
to
find
in
your
issue
of
a
long
and
detailed
attack
upon
a
book
that
had
not
yet
been
published
in
his
forthcoming
book
commits
the
errors
of
judgment
and
of
fact
with
which
your
heavily
autobiographical
critic
charged
him
is
important
should
be
able
to
get
hold
of
the
book
at
once
the
attack
was
made
from
an
advance
copy
this
practice
should
take
root
and
spread
the
man
who
submits
a
manuscript
to
a
publisher
will
find
himself
reviewed
before
he
is
accepted
and
publication
will
become
a
sort
of
formality
note

an

which
is
to

the
work
actually
appears
am
not
privileged
to
analyze
it
publicly
in
detail
have
compared
its
text
with
already
published
commentaries
on
the
series
of

the

with

a
rebuttal
to
the
of
which
is
publishing
the

this
month
of
recognize
and
freely
acknowledge
that
they
invited
such
reaction

allowing

to

from
the

falsehoods

incoherent

article
presents
the
reader
with
an
absurdity
at
its

calls
the
conclusion
admitted
valid
by
historians
and
military
strategists
alike
a
perverted
conclusion

impressionistic
conception

on
no
more
authoritative
basis
than
account

left
to
choose
between
the

only
fact
that

the
result
of
the
tea
party
we
are
to
believe
that
actively
supported
radar
outside

dissembling
discounted
it
inside
so
would
lean
to
conception
of
the
man
think
it
was
a
grave
error
to
print
the
article
at
this
time
the
unfortunate
people
unable
to
attend
the
lectures
it
casts
an
unjustifiable
aura
of
falsehood
over
the
book
which
may
dissuade
some
people
from
reading
it

not

impious

been
considerably

in

the

more
comically
rounded

the
medium
more
as
an
uneasy
guest
than
as
a
relaxed
member
of
the
family
seems
to
be
an
unfortunate
assumption
that
an
hour
of
jazz
in
prime
evening
time
for
example
could
not
be
justified
without
the
trimmings
of
a
portentous
documentary
least
this
seemed
to
be
the
working
hypothesis
for
presented
on
program
came
out
of
the
department
and
was
slotted
in
the
series
necessarily
thinks
along
documentary
lines
so
it
might
be
worth
while
to
assign
a
future
jazz
show
to
a
different
department
one
with
enough
confidence
in
the
musical
material
to
cut
down
on
the
number
of
performers
and
give
them
a
little
room
to
display
their
talents
a
matter
of
fact
this
latter
approach
has
already
been
tried
and
with
pleasing
results
few
years
ago
a
offered
a
broad
range
of
styles
ranging
from
big
band
to
the
enthusiastic
audience
confirmed
the
live
character
of
the
hour
and
provided
the
interaction
between
musician
and
hearer
which
almost
always
seems
to
improve
the
quality
of
performance
that
same
time
series
on
the
popular
arts
proved
again
that
giving
jazz
ample
breathing
space
is
one
of
the
most
sensible
things
a
producer
can
do
an
hour
remembered
for
its
almost
rudderless
movement
a
score
of
jazz
luminaries
went
before
the
cameras
for
lengthy
periods
program
had
been
arranged
to
permit
the
establishment
of
a
mood
of
intense
concentration

at

in
extreme
closeups
then
considerately
pulled
back
for

not
be
faulted
on
the
choice

already
mentioned
of
the
big
problems
was
how
to
blend
pictures
and
music
of
the
past
with
live
performances
by
musicians
of
today
had
gathered
a
lot
of
historical
material
which
it
was
eager
to
share
example
there
was
sheet
music
with
the
word
jazz
in
the
title
to
illustrate
how
a
word
of
uncertain
origin
took
hold
zoomed
into
closeup
range
in
regular
succession
like
telephone
poles
passing
on
the
highway
while
representative
music
reinforced
the
mood
of
the
late
teens
and
well
chosen
and
cleverly
arranged
such
memorabilia
unfortunately
amounted
to
more
of
an
interruption
than
an
auxiliary
to
the
main
business
which
considering
the
talent
at
hand
should
probably
have
been
the
gathering
of
fresh
samples
of
the
style
source
of
pride
was
its
rare
film
clip
of
but
this
view
of
the
great
trumpeter
flew
by
so
fast
that
a
prolonged
wink
would
have
blotted
out
the
entire
glimpse
in
presenting
still
photographs
of
early
jazz
groups
the
program
allowed
no
time
for
a
close
perusal
may
have
wound
up
satisfying
neither
the
confirmed
fan
nor
the
inquisitive
newcomer
trying
to
be
both
a
serious
survey
of
a
bygone
era
and
a
showcase
for
artists
the
program
turned
out
to
be
a
example
of
either
the
willingness
to
experiment
in
this
musical
field
is
to
be
commended
and
future
essays
happily
anticipated
may
not
have
anticipated
the
tremendous
reception
she
received
from
the
audience
attending
her
debut
as
in
night
crowd
staged
its
own
mad
scene
in
salvos
of
cheers
and
applause
and
finally
a
standing
ovation
as

a
fantastic

with
the
help
of

other

some
disconcerting
applause
even
before
she
had
sung
a
note
the
audience
waxed
but
discriminating
operagoers
reserved
judgment
as
her
singing
showed
signs
of
strain
her
musicianship
some
questionable
procedure
and
her
acting
uncomfortable
stylization
she
gained
composure
during
the
second
act
her
technical
resourcefulness
emerged
stronger
though
she
had
already
revealed
a
trill
almost
unprecedented
in
years
of
performances
of
topped
the
sextet
brilliantly
high
note
had
the
crowd
in
ecstasy
so
that
it
stopped
the
show
midway
in
the
but
the
real
reason
was
a
realization
of
the
extraordinary
performance
unfolding
at
the
moment
appeared
almost
as
another
person
in
this
scene
much
more
girlish
a
sensational
coloratura
who
ran
across
stage
while
singing
and
an
actress
immersed
in
her
role
followed
the
outburst
brought
almost
breathless
silence
as
revealed
her
mastery
of
a
voice
probably
unique
among
sopranos
today
big
flexible
voice
with
uncommon
range
has
been
superbly
disciplined
at
the
start
must
have
caused
the
blemishes
of
her
first
scene
or
she
may
warm
up
slowly
the
fullness
of
her
vocal
splendor
however
she
could
sing
the
famous
scene
magnificently
it
was
fascinating
aurally
and
dramatically
quite
realistic
years
have
passed
since
a
audience

anything
comparable

perhaps
the
earlier
scenes
will
emerge
equally
fine

marked
the
debut
of
a
most
promising
young
conductor
injected
more
vitality
into
the
score
than
it
has
revealed
in
many
years
may
respect
too
much
the
tradition
of
letting
singers
hold
on
to
their
notes
but
to
restrain
them
in
a
opera
may
be
quite
difficult

really
quite
fun
as
long
as
you
like

will
need
a
stereo
music
system
with
speakers
preferably
placed
at
least
seven
or
eight
feet
apart
and
one
or
more
of
the
new
records
are
of
these
to
choose
from
all
of
them

popular
music
except
for
the
star
release

the
marching
songs
of
several
nations
recorded
as
though
the
various
national
bands
were
marching
by
your
reviewing
stand
with
crowd
effects
interruptions
by
jet
planes
and
sundry
other
touches
of
realism
this
disc
displays
new
technique
to
the
best
effect
of
the
jackets
carry
a
fairly
technical
and
detailed
explanation
of
this
new
recording
program
reference
is
made
to
the
possibility
of
recording
other
than
popular
music
in
this
manner
and
it
would
not
seem
to
lend
itself
well
to
serious
music
is
greatly
exaggerated
most
of
the
time
but
when
the
sounds
of
the
two
speakers
are
allowed
to
mix
there
is
excellent
depth
and
dimension
to
the
music
definitely
hear
some
of
the
instruments
close
up
and
others
farther
back
with
the
difference
in
placement
apparently
more
distinct
than
would
result
from
the
nearer
instruments
merely
being
louder
than
the
ones
farther
back
is
a
characteristic
of
good
stereo
recording
and
one
of
its
tremendous
advantages
over
monaural
sound
explains
that
the
very
distinct
directional
effect
in
the
series
is
due
in
large
part
to
their
novel
methods
of
microphoning
and
recording
the
music
on
a
number
of
separate
tape
channels
are
then
mixed
by
their
sound
engineers
with
the
active
of
the
musical
staff
and
combined
into
the
final
two
channels
which
are
impressed
on
the
record
some
of
the
numbers
the
instrumental
parts
have
even
been
recorded
at
different
times
and
then
later
combined
on
the
master
tape
to
produce
special
effects
clue
to
the
character
of
approach
in
these
discs
may
be
gained
immediately
from
the
fact
that
ten
of
the
titles
include
the
word
percussion
or
percussive
xylophones
castanets
and
other
percussive
instruments
are
reproduced
remarkably
well
too
often
however
you
have
the
feeling
that
you
are
sitting
in
a
room
with
some
of
the
instruments
lined
up
on
one
wall
to
your
left
and
others
facing
them
on
the
wall
to
your
right
are
definitely
in
the
same
room
with
you
but
your
head
starts
to
swing
as
though
you
were
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
a
tennis
court
watching
a
spirited
volley
stirs
pleasant
memories
with
songs
of
that
day
and
gives
forth
with
tingling
jazz
in
seemed
one
of
the
least
attractive
discs
the
arrangements
just
have
so
much
character
as
the
others
is
an
extraordinary
sense
of
presence
in
all
of
these
recordings
apparently
obtained
at
least
in
part
by
emphasizing
the
middle
and
high
frequencies
penalty
for
this
is
noticeable
in
the
big
bold
brilliant
but
brassy
piano
sounds
in
of
the
releases
however
are
recorded
at
a
gratifyingly
high
level
with
resultant
masking
of
any
surface
noise
practically
guarantees
enjoyment
and
is
a
dramatic
demonstration
of
the
potentialities
of
any
stereo
music
system
films
manage
somehow
to
be
authentic
but
not
realistic
but
true
authenticity
and
realism
often
related
at
all
every
film
bearing
the
imprimatur
of
is
physically
authentic
in
fact
impeccably
so
any
given
period
piece
the
costumes
vehicles
and
decor
bear
the
stamp
of
unimpeachable
authenticity

a
cadre
of

and
research
specialists
who
look

and
they

it
beautifully

a
engagement
at
the
last

thoroughly
ingratiating
company
it
is
and
when
the
final
curtain
falls
you
may
suddenly
realize
that
you
have
been
sitting
with
a
broad
grin
on
your
face
all
evening
that
it
is
all
funny
by
any
means
though
some
of
it
is
definitely
so
but
simply
that
the
dancers
are
young
and
handsome
and
communicative
and
the
program
itself
is
as
vivacious
as
it
is
varied
is
no
use
at
all

follow

kind
of
nonstop

that
demands

basically
of

in
it
has
all
been
put
into
theatrical
form
treated
selectively
choreographed
specifically
for
presentation
to
spectators
and
performed
altogether
professionally
the
surface
of
the
wide
range
of
folk
movements
is
apparent
a
sound

and
an
equally
professional
sense
of
performing
the
organization
was
created
thirteen
years
ago
it
is
obvious
that
this
is
not
the
original
company
it
is
more
likely
the
sons
and
daughters
of
that
company
girls
are
charming
children
and
the
men
are
wonderfully
vital
and
engaging
youngsters
stage
is
constantly
full
of
them
indeed
there
are
never
fewer
than
eight
of
them
on
stage
and
that
is
only
for
the
more
intimate
numbers
can
be
exuberant
or
sentimental
flirtatious
or
funny
but
the
only
thing
they
seem
unable
to
be
is
dull
pick
out
particular
numbers
is
something
of
a
problem
but
one
or
two
identifiable
items
are
too
conspicuously
excellent
to
be
missed
is
for
example
a
stunning
that
closes
the
first
act
the
mazurka
choreographed
by
to
music
from

may
be
the
most
beautiful
mazurka
you
are
likely
ever
to
see
there
is
an
enchanting
polonaise
and
the
dances
and
songs
from
the

a
magnificent
dance
for
the
men
there
are
little
touches
of

through
sheer
vitality

power
what
in

awfully
talky
for

not
all
of

directed
a
difficult
play

well

with
just
a
bit
too
much
physical
movement
in
the

taste

to

full

the

every

better
in

principals
there
is
nothing
lacking

not

as

amazed
at
the
way

progressed

one
had
to
catch
self
up
and
remember
that

really
come
back
among

again

simply
grand
as
the
distraught

then

whether

not

to
prove
my
objectivity
hasten
to
report
that
a
highly
amusing
film
which
probably
does
a
fairly
accurate
job
of
reporting
on
the
vacation
shenanigans
of
collegians
down
in

that
it
seems
to
come
to

quite

since

this

has
been
the
reading
of
book
absolutely
reject
the
of
it
have
literally
squealed
with
delight
at
the
imperturbable
perfection
with
which
the
position
is
laid
down
on
page
after
page
to
his
colleague

as
he
addresses
him
says
that
if
only
the

at

really
understand
and
himself
and
see
that
their
varying
systems
are
so
many
religions
ways
of
fronting
life
and
worth
fighting
for
then
would
have
a
genuine
philosophic
universe
best
condition
of
it
would
be
an
open
conflict
and
rivalry
of
the
diverse
systems
world
might
ring
with
the
struggle
if
we
devoted
ourselves
exclusively
to
belaboring
each
other
belaboring
is
of
course
jocular
yet
was
not
lacking
in
fundamental
seriousness
unless
we
measure
him
by
that
ultimate
seriousness
of
the
great
religious
leader
or
thinker
who
stakes
all
on
his
vision
of
this
vision
never
quite
came
despite
his
appreciation
of
it
in
others
there
is
a
dignity
and
even
a
hint
of
the
inspired
prophet
in
his
words
to
one
correspondent

what
am
going
to
reply
to
why
need
one
reply
to
everything

everybody
think
that
readers
generally
hate
minute
polemics
and
recriminations
polemic
of
ours
should
believe
be
either
very
broad
statements
of
contrast
or
fine
points
treated
singly
and
as
far
as
possible
impersonally
far
as
the
rising
generation
goes

not
simply
express
ourselves
positively
and
trust
that
the
truer
view
quietly
will
displace
the

that

as

might
be
argued
that
the

less
inhuman
than

furnish
the

with

this
argument

be

very
far

up

shortcomings
of

in

to
corrosion
wield
a
power
unknown
to
the
leading

that
of
piecemeal
aggression
remains
the
same
is
drama
enough
we
ourselves
offer
less
of

we
would
not

enemy

we
have
stood
up
to
the
we
are
stronger

cannot
so
easily
put
us
to
rights
does
the
reason
for

be
that

author

me

inexcusable
body

about

criminality
of
a

apparently
foreign
to
the

without

criticisms
of
this
generally
admirable

fascinating
book

the
treatment
of

diplomacy

is
jagged
at
the
edges
there
is
no

chapter
about

certain
misplacements
of
emphasis
and
a
failure
to
come
to

with
the
baffling
riddle
of
our
time
to
deal
with
a
wily
and
aggressive
enemy
without
appeasement
and
without
war
one
should
not
ask
for
everything
who
has
recently
abandoned
authorship
for
a
new
round
of

as
the

not

it

to
portray
the
past
than
to
prescribe

the

story
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
of

is
vitally
important
and
it
is
told
with
the
fire
of
a
historical
narrator
we
usually
hear
about
in
the
theater
is
a
place
of
bitter
political
or
domestic
unrest
lightened
occasionally
with
flashes
of
native
wit
and
charm
there
is
quite
a
different
a
rural
land
where
singing
dancing
and
romancing
are
the
thing
is
plenty
of
violence
to
be
sure
but
it
is
a
nice
violence
and
no
one
gets
killed
and
large
adaptation
of
film
provides
the
entertainment
it
set
out
to
and
we
have
a
lively
musical
show
if
not
a
superlative
one
is
the
tale
of
one
an
who
has
accidentally
killed
a
man
in
the
prize
ring
and
is
now
trying
to
forget
about
it
in
a
quiet
place
where
he
may
become
a
quiet
man
where
and
her
bullying
brother
live
is
no
place
for
a
man
who
will
not
use
his
fists
courting
of
the
mettlesome
is
impeded
considerably
thereby
providing
the
tale
which
is
told
may
be
sure
he
marries
her
in
the
end
and
has
a
fine
old
knockdown
fight
with
the
brother
and
that
there
are
plenty
of
minor
scraps
along
the
way
to
ensure
that
you
understand
what
the
word
means
there
is
a
matchmaker
one
a
role
for
which
was
happily
selected
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
a
matchmaker
in
should
happen
also
to
be
a
talented
dancer
and
gifted
improviser
of
movements
of
the
limbs
torso
and
neck
except
that
these
talents
add
immensely
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
play
is
a
joy
having
learned
his
dancing
by
practicing
it
until
he
is
practically
perfect
matchmaking
is
naturally
incidental
and
it
only
serves
right
when
a
determined
widow
takes
him
by
the
ear
and
leads
him
off
to
matrimony
a
fine
big
actor
with
a
great
head
of
blond
hair
and
a
good
voice
impersonates
he
is
not
graced
with
the
subtleties
of
romantic
technique
not
what
an
fighter
is
supposed
to
have
anyway
a
fiery
redhead
who
can
impress
you
that
she
has
a
temper
whether
she
really
has
one
or
not
plays
and
sings
the
role
very
well
too
the
mettle
which
exhibits
has
a
bit
of
theatrical
dross
in
it
never
mind
she
fits
into
the
general
scheme
well
enough
as
the
widow
spends
the
first
half
of
the
play
running
a
bar
and
singing
about
the
unlamented
death
of
her
late
husband
and
the
second
half
trying
to
acquire
a
new
one
has
a
good
firm
delivery
of
songs
and
adds
to
the
solid
virtues
of
the
evening
there
are
a
pair
of
old
biddies
played
by
and
who
may
be
right
off
the
shelf
of
stock
characters
but
they
put
such
a
combination
of
good
will
and
malevolence
into
their
parts
that
quite
entertaining
in
the
role
of
roars
and
sneers
sufficiently
to
intimidate
not
only
one
but
the
whole
army
if
he
chose
is
no
but
it
does
have
some
very
nice
romantic
background
touches
and
some
excellent
dancing
ballads
are
sweet
and
sad
and
the
music
generally
competent
sometimes
threatens
to
linger
in
the
memory
after
the
final
curtain
and
some
of
it
such
as
the
catchy

by
playing
a

quite
simple

got
up
authentically
in

and
their
dancing
and
singing
is
fine
is
that
of
the
limber
company
of
lasses
who
whirl
and
glide
and
quickstep
under
expert
choreographic
direction
male
dancers
sometimes
wear
kilts

their
performance
in
them
is
spirited
and
stimulating

the

curtain
behind
which
has
placed
couples
or
groups
who
sing
and
set
the
mood

the
scenes
which
are

no
reason
why
most
theatergoers

they

all

this
morning
more
easily
and
joyously
too
because
has
turned
the
stage

into
a
delightful
and
film
task
of
taking
the
raw
material
of
original
trio
of
films
about
people
of
the
waterfront
in
and
putting
them
again
on
the
screen
after
their
passage
through
the
musical
idiom
was
a
delicate
and
perilous
one
indeed
than
the
fans
of
old
films
and
of
their
heroic
star
the
great
were
looking
askance
at
the
project
fans
of
the

were
too
now
the
task
is
completed

the
uncertainty
resolved

derive
joy
from
this

you
have
a
sense
of

after

a
work

of

the

still

it

the

not
very
well
connected
with
what
the
singers
were
doing
all
the
opera
has
juicy
music
to
sing
and
the
goodies
are
well
distributed
with
no

than
six
leading

of
those
parts

that
of

evil
the

wicked

carried
on
by
who
was
taking
the
part
for
the
first
time
with
the
company

the
temperament
and
the
stage
presence
for
a
rousing
villain
and
he
sang
with
character
and
strong
tone
was
lacking
was
a
real
sense
of
phrase
the
kind
of
legato
singing
that
would
have
added
a
dimension
of
smoothness
to
what
is
after
all
a
very
oily
character
as
and
as
also
were
new
to
the
cast
but
only
with
respect
to
this
season
they
have
both
sung
these
parts

gave
it

color

always
a
consummate
actor
with
a
few
telling
strokes
he
characterized
magnificently
of
this
characterization
was
of
course
accomplished
with
the
vocal
chords
singing
was
strong
and
musical
unfortunately
his
voice
was
out
of
focus
and
often
spread
in
quality
in
the
title
role
as
and
as
were
holdovers
from
earlier
performances
this
season
and
all
contributed
to
a
vigorous
performance
only
they
and
in
the
pit
had
got
together
a
bit
more
birds
sing
madrigals
saith
the
poet
and
no
better
description
of
the
madrigaling
of
the
could
be
imagined
album

is
a
good
sample
of
the
special
elegant

fine
introduction

the
international
art

with
good
examples
of
and
madrigals
plus
several
chansons
have
managed
to
hold
onto
their
madrigal
tradition
better
than
anyone
else
original
impulses
came
to
late
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
continue
strong
long
after
everyone
else
had
gone
on
to
the
baroque
basso
continuo
sonatas
operas
and
the
like
after
traditions
were
weakened
by
the
interregnum
the
practice
of
singing
together
choruses
catches
and
glees
always
flourished
never
again
developed
a
strong
native
music
that
could
obliterate
the
traces
of
an
earlier
great
age
the
way
say
the
opera
in
blotted
out
the
madrigal
interest
interest
in
singing
dates
well
back
into
the
nineteenth
century
in
much
ahead
of
similar
revivals
in
other
countries
a
result
no
comparable
literature
of
the
period
is
better
known
and
better
studied
nor
more
often
performed
than
the
madrigal
and
the
other
singers
in
his
troupe
are
most
charming
and
elegant
when
they
are
squarely
in
their
tradition
and
singing
music
by
their
countrymen
and
is
an
almost
instrumental
quality
to
their
singing
with
a
tendency
to
lift
out
important
lines
and
make
them
lead
the
musical
texture
techniques

the
music
purity
and
clarity
vocal
description

the
equivalents
of

very
picturesque
is
lots
of
fun
and
the
singers
get
a
sense
of
grace
and
shape
into
other
chansons
by
and
with
the
more
sensual
intense
and
baroque
expressions
of
and
does
the
singing
seem
a
little
superficial
the
musicality
accuracy
and
infectious
charm
of
these
performances
excellently
reproduced
make
it
an
attractive
at
the

quite

it
remained
always
more

more
full
of
flavor
and
gave
titles
to
nearly
everything
they
wrote
not
in
the
later
sense
of

as
a

of
nonmusical

applauded

at

seemed
at
times
a

relief

these
proceedings
like
her
own
personal

like
and
the
inevitable
is
not
only
one
of
the
great
singers
of
our
time
but
she
is
one
of
the
superb
showmen
the
start
of

there
were
evidences
of
pique

held
to

come
onto

until
well
after

she
waved
away
one
encroaching
photographer
who
dared
approach
the
throne
unbidden
and
thereafter
the
boys
with
the
cameras
had
to
unsheathe
their

and
shoot
at
extreme
range
also
came
a
brief
contretemps
with
the
sound

who
made
the
mistake
of
being
overheard
during
a
quiet
moment
near
the
conclusion

she
made
the
tart
observation
that
never

so
much
moving
about
in

it
take
showman
long
to
realize
that
this

for

that
you
have
to

they
struck
me
as
horribly
which
was
the
way
felt
about
her
or
and
sometimes
they
were
just
plain
magnificent
like
her
shatteringly
beautiful
her
partisan
audience
such
picayune
haggling
would
have
seemed
nothing
more
than
a
critic
striving
to
hold
his
franchise
they
just
sat
back
on
their
haunches
and
cried
for
more
as
though
they
could
never
get
enough
were
rewarded
with
splendid
exciting
singing
was
as
good
as
it
can
be
done
and
her
really
personal
songs
like
were
deeply
moving
audience
let
her
leave
until
it
had
heard
although
the
fellow
that
kept
crying
for
had
to
go
home
unhappy
about
that
item
anyway
was
generous
with
her
encores
and
the
audience
was
equally
so
with
its
cheers
and
applause
and
flowers
went
home
happy
except
the
police
who
feared
that
the
throng
departing
at
might
meet
the
night
crowd
drawing
nigh
and
those
deprived
of
their
happy
hour
at
the
cocktail
bar
last
night
there
were
flashes
of
distant
lightning
in
the
northern
skies
was
perhaps
symbolic
of
the
jazz
of
the
evening
flashes
in
the
distance
but
no
storm
times
it
came
near
breaking
and
there
were
in
fact
some
lovely
peals
of
thunder
from
big
band
which
is
about
as
fine
an
aggregation
as
has
come
along
in
the
jazz
business
since
found
working
in
a
trap
band
has
been
infected
with
his
solid
sense
of
swing
and
what
it
does
seems
far
more
meaningful
than
most
of
the
noise
generated
by
the
big
concert
aggregations
what
is
equally
impressive
is
the
delicacy
and
wonderful
lyric
quality
of
both
the
band
and
baritone
sax
in
a
fragile
ballad
like
arrangement
of
subtle
swinging
rhythms
could
admire
intensely
version
of
and
the
fireworks
went
on
display
in
a
sax
tribute
to
was
considerable
contrast
between
this
performance
and
that
of
and
who
are
able
to
generate
a
tremendous
sound
for
such
a
small
group
choose
to
work
much
of
the
time
in
this
vein
prefers
to
have
his
soloist
performing
and
thus
we
get
only
brief
glimpses
of
what
his
ensemble
work
is
like
we
did
get
however
was
impressive
few
drops
of
rain
just
before
midnight
when
was
in
the
midst
of
her
first
number
scattered
the
more
timid
members
of
the
audience
briefly
but
at
this
hour
and
with
on
the
stand
most
of
the
listeners
care
whether
they
got
wet
was
back
in
top
form
somehow
mellowed
and
improved
with
the
passage
of
time
like
a
fine
wine
the
spate
of
female
vocalists
we
have
been
having
all
of
whom
took
as
a
point
of
departure
and
then
tried
to
see
what
they
could
do
that
might
make
her
seem
old
hat
it
seemed
that
all
that
has
happened
is
to
make
the
real
thing
seem
better
than
ever
open
program
evening
program
was
opened
by
the
a
group
consisting
of
on
bass
drums
and
piano
was
a
continuation
of
a
good
idea
which
was
first
tried
out
night
when
the
group
also
local
talent
went
on
first
on
local
musicians
at
this
place
in
the
program
serves
a
triple
purpose
it
saves
the
top
flight
jazz
men
from
being
wasted
in
this
unenviable
spot
when
the
audience
is
cold
restless
and
in
flux
it
prevents
from
missing
some
of
the
people
they
have
come
a
long
way
to
hear
and
it
gives
the
resident
musicians
a
chance
to
perform
before
the
famous
audience
displayed
their
sound
musicianship
not
only
in
their
own
chosen
set
but
as
the
emergency
accompanists
for
the
superb
jazz
dancers
who
have
now
been
performers
for
three
successive
years

moving
up
from
a
morning
seminar

wild
twists

oldies
as

the
delightful

the
always
reliable

taste
of
the
we
leaped

out
to

things

difficult
musician
to
categorize

his
sax
principally
for
beauty
of
tone
rather
than
for
scintillating
flights
of
meaningless
improvisations
and
he
has
a
quiet
way
of
getting
back
and
restating
the
melody
after
the
improvising
is
over
this

is
sticking
with

removed

disciplined

when

the

you
say

if
the

the
second
half
of

program
that
also
offered
the
first
showing
of
as
well
as
her

a
witty
and

score
for

places

with

the
a
refreshingly
underplayed
interpretation
of
dancing
places
could
be
anywhere
the
idiosyncrasies
and
foibles
observed
there
could

and
the
laugh

on
us

we

too
much
because

it
through

that
is
diverting

clever
almost
all
the
way
is
a
problem
piece
about
a
man
and
a
woman
and
the
three
figures
that
bother
them
somehow
the
man
and
woman
were
not
made
to
appear
very
interesting
at
the
outset
and
the
menacing
figures
failed
to
make
them
any
more
so
did
the
dancing
involved
really
seize
the
attention
at
any
time
music
here
sounded
good
the
performances
of
the
evening
were
smooth
and
assured
and
the
sizable
company
with

as
its
leading
dancers
seemed
to
be
fine

greatly
assisted
by
last
night
got
its
cycle
at
off
to
a
good
start
the
same
time
the
orchestra
announced
that
next
season
it
would
be
giving
programs
at
and
that
it
would
be
taking
these
concerts
to
the
suburbs
repeating
each
of
them
in
five
different
communities
news
announced
by
the
administrative
director
brought
applause
from
the
persons
who
filled
the
hall
showed
they
were
glad
that
would
have
a
major
orchestra
playing
there
so
often
next
season
to
take
up
the
slack
with
the
departure
to
of
the
the
and
the
season
the
orchestra
has
already
taken
a
step
toward
the
suburbs
in
that
it
is
giving
six
subscription
concerts
for
the

that
has
been
associated
with
in
since
his
triumphant
return
from
in
have
been
the
the
and
the
was
pleasant
last
night
therefore
to
hear
him
do
something
else
a
concerto
he
has
recently
recorded
young
pianist
can
make
great
chords
ring
out
as
well
as
anyone
so
last
night
the
massive
sonorities
of
this
challenging
concerto
were
no
hazard
to
him
they
were
not
what
distinguished
his
performance
elements
that
did
were
the
introspective
slow
movement
the
beautiful
transition
to
the
third
movement
and
the
passages
of
filigree
that
laced
through
the
bigger
moments
of
the
opening
movement
and
the
final
gave
the
slow
movement
some
of
the
quality
of
a
the
conductor
sensitive
accompanist
that
he
is
picked
up
the
idea
and
led
the
orchestra
here
with
a
sense
of
brooding
poetic
mystery
collaboration
was
remarkable
as
it
was
in
both
the
other
movements
too
who
will
lead
all
of
the
concerts
in
the
cycle
also
conducted
the
and
the
orchestra
was
obviously
on
its
mettle
and
it
played
most
responsively
although
there
was
plenty
of
vigor
in
the
performance
the
ensemble
was
at
its
best
when
the
playing
was
soft
and
lyrical
yet
full
of
the
suppressed
tension
that
is
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
will
be
the
next
soloist
on
are
times
when
one
suspects
that
the
songs
that
are
dropped
from
musical
shows
before
they
reach
may
really
be
better
than
many
of
those
that
are
left
in
in
the
era
of
the
integrated
musical
when
an
individual
song
must
contribute
to
the
development
of
the
show
it
is
understandable
that
a
song
no
matter
how
excellent
it
may
be
on
its
own
terms
is
cut
out
because
it
does
not
perform
the
function
required
of
it
the
more
casually
constructed
musicals
of
the
and
there
would
seem
to
have
been
less
reason
for
eliminating
a
song
of
merit
there
is
the
classic
case
of
the
too
static
when
it
was
first
heard
in
in
in
it
was
dropped
from
the
score
was
heard
again
in
in
in
the
first
version
of
and
again
abandoned
shortly
before
the
entire
show
was
given
up
finally
reached
in
the
second
and
successful
version
of
in
another
song
in
was
retrieved
from
a
failure
second
chance
the
and
were
loath
to
let
a
good
song
get
away
from
them
one
of
melodies
seemed
to
deserve
a
better
fate
than
interment
in
or
the
obscurity
of
a
failure
was
likely
to
deck
it
out
with
new
lyrics
to
give
it
a
second
chance
in
another
show
of
these
double
entries

been
collected
by

with

songs
that
disappeared
permanently

others

have
not
become
part
of
the
constantly
heard
and
repertory

a
delightfully
refreshing
album
the
particular
gems
in
this
collection
is
the
impudent
opening
song
of
an
impressive
forecast
of
the
wit
and
melody
that
were
to
come
from

in
the
years

moments

to

the

compassionately

the

on
this

at

rather
tediously
the

rivets
on
the

of
a

complicated
by
nothing

more
than

viewer
may
recall
several
seasons
back
when
the
paramount
concern
was
for
the
marital
discord
of
a
society
dilettante
that
the

magnificent
as
the
straggle
from
a
cathedral
dotting
a
huge
cobblestone
square
and
drop
their
weapons
by
pages
once
in
a
very
long
while
comes
a
book
that
gives
the
reader
a
magic
sense
of
sharing
a
rare
experience
by

just
that
a
haunting
warmly
personal
chronicle
of
a
man

a
remote
cottage

with
a
ring
of

begins
the
poem
from
which
takes
his
title
and
it
is
this
mystic
bond
between
the
human
and
natural
world
that
the
author
conveys

the
site
of
a
opposite

of

of

a
moving

the
evocations
of
time
and

of
passionate
encounter
between
man
and
a
natural

which
today
seems
almost
lost

be
enough
it
is
an
otter
who
travelled
with
and
gave
name
to
a
new
species
from
the
marshes
to
his
flat
may
sound
extravagant
to
say
that
there
has
never
been
a
more
engaging
animal
in
all
literature
is
not
only
a
compliment
to
of
whom
there
are
a
fine
series
of
photographs
and
drawings
in
the
book
but
to
the
author
who
has
catalogued
the
saga
of
a
frightened
otter
journey
by
plane
from
to
then
by
train
where
he
lay
curled
in
the
wash
basin
playing
with
the
water
tap
to
with
affectionate
detail
as
his
owner
was

to

had
strange
inexplicable

to
nip

of
unsuspecting
visitors

on

he
would
open
and
ransack
drawers

small

he
would
invent
games
and
play
by
himself
for
hours

and

he
explored
every
inch
of
glen
beach
and
burn
once
stranding
himself
for
hours
on
a
ledge
high
up
a
sheer
cliff
and
waiting
with
calm
faith
to
be
rescued
by
who
nearly
lost
his
life
in
doing
so
year
and
a
day
of
this
idyll
is
described
for
the
reader
one
in
which
not
only
discovery
of
a
new
world
of
personality
is
charted
but
as
well
the
solitude
of
there
had
been
no
loneliness
be
quite
alone
where
there
are
no
other
human
beings
is
sharply
exhilarating
it
is
as
though
some
pressure
had
suddenly
been
lifted
allowing
an
intense
awareness
a
sharpening
of
the
senses
with
the
increasing
interdependence
between
himself
and
came
a
knowledge
of
an
obscure
need
that
of
being
trusted
implicitly
by
some
creature
other
people

time

it
remained
around
us
three
that
his
orb
revolved
when
he
was
not
away
in
his
own
imponderable
world
of
wave
and
water
we
were
his
and
he
behaved
towards
us
with
a
mixture
of
trust
and
abuse
passion
and
irritation

each
of

the
idyll

brief
details
of
death

depth
to
the
story
give
it
an
edge
of
ironic
tragedy
to
whom
gave
endless
affection
and
fealty
was
responsible
in
the
form
of
a
road
worker
with
a
pickaxe
who
somehow
becomes
an
abstract
symbol
of
the
savage

through
a
strange
coincidence
manages
to
acquire
a
female
otter
and
the
fascinating
story
starts
once
more
is
not
sure
who
emerges
as
the
main
personality
of
this
book
with
his
rollicking
ways
or
himself
poet
portrait
painter
writer
journalist
traveller
and
zoologist
sensitive

never

and
unabashed
reviewer
read
the
book
when
it
was
first
brought
out
in
with
a
sense
of
discovery
and
excitement
has
widened
to
enchant
the
world
performances
of
the
are
the
most
important
recent
events
in
the
theater
serve
to
contradict
a
popular
notion
that
the
merely
repeats
as
accurately
as
possible
the
techniques
of
acting
the
classics
that
prevailed
in
the
century
the
contrary
the
old
plays
are
continually
being
reinterpreted
and
each
new
production
of
a
classic
has
only
a
brief
history
at
the
course
the
revivals
last
longer
than
the
others
and
that
further
reminds
us
that
the
is
not
insensitive
to
criticism
directors
of
the
do
not
respond
to
adverse
notices
in
as
docile
and
subservient
a
manner
as
the
producers
who
in
two
instances
this
season
closed
their
plays
after
one
performance
they
are
aware
of
the
world
outside
they
court
public
approval
they
delight
in
full
houses
and
they
occasionally
dare
to
experiment
in
interpreting
a
dramatic
classic
novel
approaches
to
the
classic
plays
are
frequently
attempted
government
pays
a
subsidy
for
revival
of
the
classics
and
this
policy
attracts
experimenters
who
sometimes
put
characters
in
modern
dress
and
often
achieve
interesting
results
far
as
know
the
has
never
put
people
in
the
costumes
of
the
century
but
they
do
reinterpret
plays
and
characters
season
the
two
principal
experiments
came
to
grief
and
in
consequence
we
can
expect
fairly
soon
to
see
still
newer
productions
of

new

done

instead
of
ancient
perhaps
that
is
the
equivalent
for
thrusting
this
characters
into
our
own
time
speaking
of
the
lines
seemed
excessively
slow
and
stately
possibly
in
an
effort
to
capture
the
spirit
of
century
elegance
few
literary
men
defended
what
they
took
to
be
an
emphasis
on
the
poetry
at
the
expense
of
the
drama
but
the
response
was
mainly
hostile
and
quite
violent
new
was
interpreted
according
to
a
principle
that
is
becoming
increasingly
common
in
the
playing
of
classic
comedy
the
idea
of
turning
some
obviously
ludicrous
figure
into
a
tragic
character
the
specialists
of
some
years
ago
tried
to
humanize

of

for
those
who

to
collect

it
must
truthfully
be
said
that
what
they
heard
was
more
syrupy
than

more
mannered
than

was
sentimental

to

for
this

the

the

a
misguided
attempt
to
save
her
marriage
to
a
neurotic
husband
left
sterile
as
a
result
of

automobile
accident
as
the

his
role
glumly
under
the
lurid
direction
of
as

as
his
unsympathetic
father
and
as
an
innocent
bystander
a
protracted
hysterical
trial
scene
more
notable
for
the
frankness
of
its
language
than
for
dramatic
credibility
the
jury
to
no
surprise
leaves
the
legal
question
unresolved
the
husband
drops
the
case
and
returns
to
his
wife
both
seem
sorry
they

the
matter
up
in
the
first
place

the
audience

final
change
of
bill
in
its
season
the
chose
tonight
to
give
one
of
those
choreographic
miscellanies
known
as
a
gala
program
at
the
doubt
the
underlying
idea
was
to
show
that
for
all
the
elegance
and
artistry
that
have
distinguished
its
presentations
thus
far
it
too
could
give
a
circus
if
it
pleased
please
it
did
in
every
sense
of
the
word
for
it
had
the
audience
shouting
much
of
the
time
in
a
manner
far
from
typical
of
audiences
the
end
of
the
program
indeed
there
was
a
demonstration
that
lasted
for
minutes
and
nothing
could
stop
it
repeated
a
fantastic
technical
bit
from
the
closing
number
but
even
then
there
was
a
substantial
number
of
diehards
who
seemed
determined
not
to
go
home
at
all
a
plea
from
the
house
manager
finally
broke
up
the
party
for
all
the
manifest
intention
to
show
off
this
was
a
circus
with
a
difference
for
instead
of
descending
in
quality
to
what
is
known
as
a
popular
level
it
added
further
to
the
evidence
that
this
is
a
very
great
dancing
company

a
rousing
version
of

danced
by
some
men
and
no

it
contains
everything
in
the
books
lusty
comedy
gregarious
cavorting
and
tricks
that
only
madmen
or
would
attempt
to
make
the
human
body
perform
and
were
the
chief
soloists
but
everybody
on
stage
was
magnificent
the
other
extreme
in
character
was
the
excerpt
from
the

the
evening

was
why
do

a

ballet

which
a
lovelorn
hero
searches
for
his

extraordinarily
beautiful
shadows

can
all
dance
like
nothing
human
which
of
course
is
altogether
fitting

a

designed

belong
to

enough

root
question
in

is
always
the
to

politics
is
simply
to
know

to
know
the
relative
weight
of
names
who
are
heroes
who
are
straw
men
who
controls
who
does
not
to
operate
in

one
must
go
a
step
further
one
must
build
a
bridge
to
such
names
establish
a
warmth
a
personal
connection
the
hard
life
of
politics
it
is
well
known
that
no
platform
nor
any
program
advanced
by
either
major
party
has
any
purpose
beyond
expressing
emotion
platforms
are
meaningless
the
program
of
either
party
is
what
lies
in
the
vision
and
conscience
of
the
candidate
the
party
chooses
to
lead
it

evening

certainly
not
no
singer
ever
is
and
yet
the
rewards
of
the
evening
again
lay
more
in
paying
tribute
to
a
great
figure
of
times
gone
by
than
in
present
accomplishments
better
part
of
gallantry
might
be
perhaps
to
honor
her
perennial
good
looks
and
her
gorgeous
gown
and
to
chide
the
orchestra
for
not
playing
in
the
same
keys
in
which
she
had
chosen
to
sing

however
could
be
expected
to
follow
a
singer
through
quite
as
many
adventures
with
pitch
as
encountered
last
night
all
fairness
there
were
flashes
of
the
great
stylist
of
yesteryear
flashes
even
of
the
old
consummate
vocalism

came
in
the
breathtaking
way

the
cadenza
to

suddenly
fell
away
at
this
point
the
whole
however
one
must
wonder
at
just
what
it
is
that
forces
a
beloved
artist
to
besmirch
her
own
reputation

marches
inexorably

by
four
scientists
competent
in
cosmology
of
these
men
discussed
major
theories
of
the
universe
while
the
other
acted
as
a
moderator
participants
were
professor
of
mathematics
at
reader
in
mathematics
at
a
lecturer
at
and
a
reader
in
theoretical
astronomy
at
the
of
and
reader
in
applied
mathematics
at
the
of
and
functioned
as
moderator
programs
were
so
well
received
by
the
public
that
the
arguments
have
been
published
in
a
totally
engrossing
little
book
called
begins
with
a
discussion
of
the
relativistic
theories
of
the
universe
based
on
the
general
theory
of
relativity
of
all
and
this
has
been
calculated
by
observation
the
universe
is
expanding
that
is
the
galaxies
are
receding
from
each
other
at
immense
speeds
of
this
holds
that
the
universe
is
becoming
more
thinly
populated
by
stars
and
whatever
else
is
there
expansion
has
been
going
on
for
an
estimated
eight
billion
years
and
contracts
supports
the
idea
that
the
universe
both
expands
and
contracts
that
in
several
billion
years
the
expansion
will
slow
up
and
reverse
itself
and
that
the
contraction
will
set
in
after
many
more
billions
of
years
when
all
the
galaxies
are
whistling
toward
a
common
center
this
movement
will
slow
down
and
reverse
itself
again
disagrees
with
the
theory
supports
the
theory
which
holds
that
matter
is
continually
being
created
in
space
this
reason
he
says
the
density
of
the
universe
always
remains
the
same
even
though
the
galaxies
are
zooming
away
in
all
directions
galaxies
are
forever
being
formed
to
fill
in
the
gaps
left
by
the
receding
galaxies
this
is
true
then
the
universe
today
looks
just
as
it
did
millions
of
years
ago
and
as
it
will
look
millions
of
years
hence
even
though
the
universe
is
expanding
new
galaxies
to
be
created
declares
it
would
only
be
necessary
for
a
single
hydrogen
atom
to
be
created
in
an
area
the
size
of
your
living
room
once
every
few
million
years
contends
this
idea
conflict
with
experiments
on
which
the
principle
of
conservation
of
matter
and
energy
is
based
because
some
slight
error
must
be
assumed
in
such
experiments
backs
the
theory
that
we
live
in
an
electric
universe
and
this
theory
starts
with
the
behavior
of
protons
and
electrons
and
electrons
bear
opposite
electrical
charges
which
make
them
attract
each
other
and
when
they
are
joined
they
make
up
an
atom
of
hydrogen
the
basic
building
block
of
matter
charges
of
the
electron
and
proton
are
believed
to
be
exactly
equal
and
opposite
but
is
not
so
sure
says
the
proton
has
a
slightly
greater
charge
than
the
electron
so
slight
it
is
presently
immeasurable
would
give
the
hydrogen
atom
a
slight
if
one
hydrogen
atom
were
placed
at
the
surface
of
a
large
sphere
of
hydrogen
atoms
it
would
be
subject
both
to
the
gravitation
of
the
sphere
and
the
of
all
those
atoms
in
the
sphere
electrical
forces
the
are
far
more
powerful
than
gravitation
the
surface
hydrogen
atoms
would
shoot
away
from
the
sphere
then
imagines
the
universe
as
a
large
hydrogen
sphere
with
surface
atoms
shooting
away
from
it
he
claims
would
reasonably
account
for
the
expansion
of
the
universe
glimpse
slim
book
while
giving
the
reader
only
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
scientific
mind
confronting
the
universe
has
the
appeal
that
informed
conversation
always
has
photographs
and
charts
of
galaxies
help
the
keep
up
with
the
discussion
and
the
smooth
language
indicates
the
contributors
were
determined
to
avoid
the
jargon
that
seems
to
work
its
way
into
almost
every
field
is
clear
from
this
discussion
that
cosmologists
of
every
persuasion
look
hopefully
toward
the
day
when
a
satellite
can
be
equipped
with
optical
devices
which
will
open
up
new
vistas
to
science
the
intense
absorption
of
rays
in
the
atmosphere
seriously
hinders
ground
observation
scientists
are
convinced
that
a
telescope
unclouded
by
the
gases
will
go
a
long
way
toward
bolstering
or
destroying
cosmic
theories
would
seem
to
be
some
small
solace
in
the
prospect
that
the
missile
race
between
nations
is
at
the
same
time
accelerating
the
study
of
the
space
around
us
giving
us
a
ladder
from
which
to
peer
at
alien
regions
doing
away
with
the
tea
tray
the
elephants
and
the
giant
tortoise
science
has
developed
a
series
of
rationally
defensible
explanations
of
the
cosmos
although
the
universe
may
forever
defy
understanding
it
might
even
now
be
finding
its
match
in
the
imagination
of
man
the
new
play
at
the
on
which
has
been
made
over
from
a
night
club
is
about
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
awakening
of
an
farm
girl
successful
in
before
its
transfer
to
most
of
is
as
relentlessly
dour
as
the
trappings
of
the
small
new
theater
are
gaudy
in
its
final
scene
where
shakes
off
the
disappointment
of
being
jilted
by
her
intellectual
lover
and
proclaims
her
emancipation
do
we
get
much
which
makes
worthwhile
the
series
of
boorish
rustic
happenings
we
have
had
to
watch
for
most
of
the
first
two
and
acts
burden
of
message
is
that
people
living
close
to
the
soil
at
least
in
are
not
the
happy
fine
strong
natural
earthy
people
intellectuals
imagine
they
are
genuine
clods
proud
of
their
cloddishness
and
openly
antagonistic
to
the
illuminating
influences
of
aesthetics
or
thought
care
no
more
for
politics
says
than
they
do
for
a
symphony
to
have
roots
in
the
soil
they
actually
have
none
in
life
dwell
in
short
in
the
doltish
twilight
in
which
peasants
and
serfs
of
the
past
are
commonly
reported
to
have
lived
this
is
a
theme
which
does
not
take
so
much
time
to
state
as
dedicates
to
it
much
untidiness
of
mind
and
household
does
not
attract
the
interest
of
the
theatergoer
unless
he
has
been
living
in
a
gilded
palace
perhaps
and
wants
a
real
big
heap
of
contrast
messy
meals
the
washing
of
dishes
the
drying
of
clothes
may
be
realism
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
redundancy
for
the
good
points
as
has
a
great
fund
of
animal
spirits
a
strong
voice
and
a
warm
smile
is
just
home
from
a
sojourn
in
where
she
has
become
the
sweetheart
of
a
young
fellow
named
we
never
do
see
him
and
has
been
subjected
to
a
first
course
in
thinking
and
appreciating
including
a
dose
of
good
socialism
while
she
is
able
to
tell
her
retarded
family
about
the
new
world
she
has
seen
open
before
her
has
not
been
able
to
observe
her
progress
and
instead
of
appearing
at
a
family
party
to
be
looked
over
like
a
new
bull
he
sends
a
letter
of
dismissal
getting
no
sympathy
for
her
misfortune
soon
rallies
and
finds
that
although
she
has
lost
a
lover
she
has
gained
her
freedom
a
too
long
sustained
declamatory
flight
this
final
speech
is
convincing
and
we
see
why
audiences
apparently
were
impressed
by
were
several
fairly
good
minor
portraits
in
the
play
including
impersonation
of
a
stubborn
rather
pathetic
father

vigorous
characterization

farm
mother

brooked
no

as
creeping
mannerism

time
of

at
on

than
all
had
had
two
nights
earlier
when
presented
the
first
of
two
dance
programs
the
orchestra
was
sensibly
situated
down
on
the
field
the
stage
floor
was
apparently
in
decent
condition
for
dancing

the
order
of
the
program

additionally
a
bonus
for
the
patrons

much
upon
the
precision
and
incisiveness
of
the

earthy

recent

there
have
been
extensive
lamentations
over
the
absence
of

not
for

many
regretted
the
passing
of
new

on

decided
to

what
it

to
correct
this
aural

it
offered
by

on
the
right
track
in
the
sound
medium
there
has
been
excessive
emphasis
on

there

be
a

work

for
an

in

in

employs
an
structure
that
particularly
needs
to
be
seen
if
comprehension
is
to
be
encouraged
device
is
to
explore
obsession
with
disaster
and
violence
through
the
eyes
of
a
group
of
models
who
remain
part
of
someone
painting
rather
than
just
be
themselves

succession
of

they
appear
in
different
guises
patrons
of

performers
in

in

in
each

they
inevitably
put
ugliness
before

in

there
is
both
protest
and
aspiration
of
merit
its
relentless
discursiveness
and
determined
complexity
are
so
overwhelming
that
after

hour

quite
conceivably
an

different
impression
will
obtain

good
to

those

again
that
opened

the
slow

modest
entrance
of

built
steadily

is

in

to

a

parked

not

liberty
it
is
an
absurdity
it
is
in
the

is
the
primary

my
principal
objection
in

is
to
the
hackneyed
treatment
of
pilots
submariners
atomic

and
all
the
of
our

contrast
the

ably

such
stalwart

this
invincible
determination

a

unable

and
each
refusing

of

belief
that
in
most
countries
about

not
really

about

about

call
themselves

to
keep
up
appearances
and

considered
respectable
and
only
the
last

are
genuine
and

these

such

all
practical

the
stands
disunited
undedicated
and
unprepared
for
the

of

leadership
this
barrage
of
launches
his
attack
upon
the
blunderings
of
the
given
to
mincing
words
he
places
heavy
blame
upon
the
faulty
uncourageous
leadership
of
and
particularly
end
leadership
in
passed
from
because
the
devoted
its
attention
to
the
creation
of
a
welfare
state
looking
inward
overseas
problems
were
neglected
and
the
baton
was
passed
on
to
the

economic
aid
and
military
equipment
to
friend
and
foe
alike
pushed
wartorn
and
nations
into
prosperity
but
she
failed
to
lead
them
into
unity
and
world
peace
has
divided
more
than
she
has
united
the
reasons
are
that
generally
believes
that
she
can
buy
anything
with
dollars
and
that
she
compulsively
strives
to
be
liked
she
really
does
not
know
how
to
match
the
quantity
of
dollars
given
away
by
a
quality
of
leadership
that
is
basically
needed
the
greater
reason
for
fumbling
stumbling
leadership
is
due
to
the
shock
her
pride
suffered
when
the
attacked
at
are
determined
writes
not
to
be
surprised
again
and
now
insist
on
a
state
of
readiness
for
war
which
is
not

unnecessary
but
also
creates
nervousness
among
other
nations
in
the
not
to
mention
such
great
suspicions
among
the
nations
of
the
bloc
that
any
progress
towards
peaceful
coexistence
or
disarmament
is
not
possible
net
result
is
that
under

the
general
world
situation
has
become
bad
the
people
who
in
two
previous

wars
were
very
reluctant
to

it

if
the

now
taking

the
leadership
and

necessary

the
current

no

critical

otherwise
to
hear

after
he

a
kind

the

the
discovery
that
many

the
chemical
difference

fats

into
one
of
three
categories
saturated
and
degree
of
saturation
depends
on
the
number
of
hydrogen
atoms
on
the
fat
molecule
fats
can
accommodate
no
more
hydrogens
fats
have
room
for
two
more
hydrogens
on

molecule
and
the
fat
molecule
has
room
for
at
least
four
hydrogens
three
fats
have
similar
caloric
values
about
calories
per
but
each
exerts
a
radically
different
influence
on
blood
cholesterol
a
result
although
we
still
make
use
of
this
distinction
there
is
much
confusion
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
basic
terms
employed
what
is
meant
by
spirit
and
by
matter
terms
are
generally
taken
for
granted
as
though
they
referred
to
direct
and
axiomatic
elements
in
the
common
experience
of
all
in
the
contemporary
context
this
is
precisely
what
one
must
not
do
in
the
modern
world
neither
spirit
nor
matter
refer
to
any
generally
elements
of
experience
are
in
a
transitional
stage
in
which
many
of
the
connotations
of
former
usage
have
had
to
be
revised
or
rejected
the
words
are
used
we
are
never
sure
which
of
the
traditional
meanings
the
user
may
have
in
mind
or
to
what
extent
his
revisions
and
rejections
of
former
understandings
correspond
to
ours
of
the
most
widespread
features
of
contemporary
thought
is
the
almost
universal
disbelief
in
the
reality
of
spirit
a
few
centuries
ago
the
world
of
spirits
was
as
populous
and
real
as
the
world
of
material
entities
only
in
popular
thought
but
in
that
of
the
highly
educated
as
well
was
this
true
fairies
angels
and
a
host
of
other
spiritual
beings
were
as
much
a
part
of
the
experiential
world
of
western
man
as
were
rocks
and
trees
and
stars
such
a
world
the
words
matter
and
spirit
both
referred
to
directly
known
realities
in
the
common
experience
of
all
it
important
elements
of
and
of
the
view
of
reality
in
general
which
now
cause
us
much
difficulty
could
be
responded
to
quite
naturally
and
spontaneously
progress
of
science
over
these
last
few
centuries
and
the
gradual
replacement
of
by
scientific
categories
of
reality
have
to
a
large
extent
emptied
the
spirit
world
of
the
entities
which
previously
populated
it
carrying
out
this
program
science
has
undoubtedly
performed
a
very
considerable
service
for
which
it
can
claim
due
credit
objectification
of
the
world
of
spirit
in
popular
superstition
had
certainly
gone
far
beyond
what
the
experience
of
spirit
could
justify
or
support
is
fully
competent
to
deal
with
any
element
of
experience
which
arises
from
an
object
in
space
and
time
therefore
it
turned
its
attention
to
the
concrete
entities
with
which
popular
imagination
had
peopled
the
world
of
spirit
these
entities
soon
lost
whatever
status
they
had
enjoyed
as
actual
elements
of
external
reality
doing
so
science
has
unquestionably
cleared
up
widespread
misconceptions
removed
extraneous
and
illusory
sources
of
fear
and
dispelled
many
undesirable
popular
superstitions
have
been
indeed
many
important
and
valuable
gains
from
the
development
of
our
present
scientific
view
of
the
world
for
which
we
may
be
rightly
grateful
this
has
not
however
been
an
unmixed
blessing
scientific
debunking
of
the
spirit
world
has
been
in
a
way
too
successful
and
too
thorough
house
has
been
swept
so
clean
that
contemporary
man
has
been
left
with
no
means
or
at
best
with
wholly
inadequate
means
for
dealing
with
his
experience
of
spirit
the
particular
form
of
conceptualization
which
popular
imagination
had
made
in
response
to
the
experience
of
spirit
was
undoubtedly
defective
the
raw
experience
itself
which
led
to
such
excesses
remains
with
us
as
vividly
as
ever
simply
find
ourselves
in
the
position
of
having
no
means
for
inquiring
into
the
structure
and
meaning
of
this
range
of
our
experience
is
no
framework
or
structure
of
thought
with
respect
to
which
we
can
organize
it
and
no
part
of
reality
as
we
know
and
apprehend
it
with
respect
to
which
we
can
refer
this
experience
has
simply
left
us
helpless
and
powerless
in
this
important
sector
of
our
lives
situation
in
which
we
find
ourselves
is
brought
out
with
dramatic
force
in
play
which
deals
with
the
witch
trials
the
play
opens
the
audience
is
introduced
to
the
community
of
in
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
from
a
quaint
concern
with
witches
and
devils
which
provides
the
immediate
problem
in
the
opening
scene
it
is
a
quite
normal
community
conversation
of
the
characters
creates
an
atmosphere
suggesting
the
usual
mixture
of
pleasures
foibles
irritations
and
concerns
which
would
characterize
the
common
life
of
a
normal
village
in
any
age
is
no
occasion
to
feel
uneasy
or
disturbed
about
these
people
the
audience
can
sit
back
at
ease
and
from
the
perspective
of
an
enlightened
time
which
no
longer
believes
in
such
things
enjoy
the
dead
seriousness
with
which
the
characters
in
the
play
take
the
witches
and
devils
which
are
under
discussion
teenage
girl
is
being
sharply
questioned
by
her
minister
uncle
the
about
a
wild
night
affair
in
the
woods
in
which
she
and
some
other
girls
had
seemed
to
have
had
contact
with
these
evil
beings
all
involved
in
this
discussion
the
devil
is
a
real
entity
who
can
really
be
confronted
in
the
woods
on
a
dark
night
the
demon
world
is
populated
with
real
creatures
and
witches
actually
can
be
seen
flying
through
the
air
the
play
unfolds
however
the
audience
is
subtly
brought
into
the
grip
of
an
awful
evil
which
grows
with
ominously
gathering
power
and
soon
engulfs
the
community
in
saint
and
sinner
alike
is
swept
up
by
it
is
like
a
mysterious
epidemic
which
starting
first
with
and
spreads
inexorably
with
a
dreadfully
growing
virulence
through
the
whole
town
until
all
have
been
infected
by
it
grows
terribly
and
unavoidably
in
power
and
leaves
in
its
wake
a
trail
of
misery
moral
disintegration
and
destruction
audience
leaves
the
play
under
a
spell
is
the
kind
of
spell
which
the
exposure
to
spirit
in
its
living
active
manifestation
always
evokes
one
asks
about
this
play
what
it
is
that
comes
upon
this
community
and
works
within
it
with
such
terrible
power
there
is
no
better
answer
to
give
than
spirit
is
not
to
attempt
to
say
what
spirit
is
but
only
to
employ
a
commonly
used
word
to
designate
or
simply
identify
a
common
experience
the
end
the
good
man
expresses
what
the
audience
has
already
come
to
feel
when
he
says
fire
a
fire
is
burning
hear
the
boot
of
see
his
filthy
face
tragic
irony
of
the
play
is
that
the
very
belief
in
and
concern
with
a
devil
who
could
be
met
in
the
woods
and
combatted
with
formulae
set
out
in
books
was
the
very
thing
that
prevented
them
from
detecting
the
real
devil
when
he
came
among
them
marvel
at
their
blindness
for
not
seeing
this
are
not
we
of
the
century
who
rightly
do
not
believe
there
is
any
such
thing
as
the
devil
just
as
bad
off
as
they
only
in
a
different
way
our
disbelief
we
think
that
we
can
no
longer
even
use
the
word
and
so
are
unable
to
even
name
the
elemental
power
which
is
so
vividly
real
in
this
play
are
left
helpless
to
cope
with
it
because
we
do
not
dare
speak
of
it
as
anything
real
for
fear
that
to
do
so
would
imply
a
commitment
to
that
which
has
already
been
discredited
and
proved
false
himself
seems
uncertain
on
this
score
a
long
commentary
which
he
has
inserted
in
the
published
text
of
the
first
act
of
the
play
he
says
at
one
point
that
experience
never
raised
a
doubt
in
his
mind
as
to
the
reality
of
the
underworld
or
the
existence
of
lieutenants
his
belief
is
not
to
his
discredit
minds
than
were
and
still
are
convinced
that
there
is
a
society
of
spirits
beyond
our
ken
page
the
other
hand
a
little
later
on
he
says
a
great
but
superficial
change
has
wiped
out
beard
and
the
horns
but
the
world
is
still
gripped
between
two
diametrically
opposed
absolutes
concept
of
unity
in
which
positive
and
negative
are
attributes
of
the
same
force
in
which
good
and
evil
are
relative
and
always
joined
to
the
same
phenomenon
such
a
concept
is
still
reserved
to
the
physical
sciences
and
to
the
few
who
have
grasped
the
history
of
ideas
we
see
the
steady
and
methodical
inculcation
into
humanity
of
the
idea
of
worthlessness
until
redeemed
the
necessity
of
the
may
become
evident
as
a
weapon
a
weapon
designed
and
used
time
and
time
again
in
every
age
to
whip
men
into
a
surrender
to
a
particular
church
or
page
he
does
not
intend
that
those
who
read
or
view
this
play
should
think
of
the
devil
as
being
actually
real
such
is
the
dramatic
power
of
his
writing
that
the
audience
is
nevertheless
left
in
the
grip
of
the
terrible
power
and
potency
of
that
which
came
over
casts
a
spell
upon
them
so
that
they
leave
with
a
feeling
of
having
been
in
the
mysterious
presence
of
an
evil
power
is
not
enough
in
accounting
for
this
feeling
to
analyze
it
into
the
wickedness
of
individual
people
added
together
to
produce
a
cumulative
effect
this
does
not
account
for
the
integral
elemental
power
of
that
which
grows
with
abounding
vigor
as
the
play
unfolds
nor
does
it
explain
the
strange
numinous
sense
of
presentness
which
comes
over
those
who
watch
the
play
like
a
spell
reality
of
spirit
emerges
in
this
play
in
spite
of
the
convictions
to
the
contrary
and
community
is
nothing
in
the
whole
range
of
human
experience
more
widely
known
and
universally
felt
than
spirit
from
spirit
there
could
be
no
community
for
it
is
spirit
which
draws
men
into
community
and
gives
to
any
community
its
unity
cohesiveness
and
permanence
for
example
of
the
spirit
of
the
this
is
a
reality
we
all
acknowledge
cannot
of
course
assign
it
any
substance
is
not
material
and
is
not
a
thing
occupying
space
and
time
it
exists
and
has
an
objective
reality
which
can
be
experienced
and
known
it
is
too
with
many
other
spirits
which
we
all
know
the
spirit
of
or
school
spirit
the
spirit
of
a
street
corner
gang
or
a
football
team
the
spirit
of
or
the
community
if
it
is
alive
has
a
spirit
and
that
spirit
is
the
center
of
its
unity
and
identity
searching
for
clues
which
might
lead
us
to
a
fresh
apprehension
of
the
reality
of
spirit
the
close
connection
between
spirit
and
community
is
likely
to
prove
the
most
fruitful
it
is
primarily
in
community
that
we
know
and
experience
spirit
is
spirit
which
gives
life
to
a
community
and
causes
it
to
cohere
is
the
spirit
which
is
the
source
of
a
drawing
power
by
means
of
which
others
are
drawn
into
it
from
the
world
outside
so
that
the
community
grows
and
prospers
the
spirit
which
lives
in
community
is
not
identical
with
the
community
idea
of
community
and
the
idea
of
spirit
are
two
distinct
and
separable
ideas
characteristic
of
the
spirit
in
community
is
its
givenness
members
of
the
community
do
not
create
the
spirit
but
rather
find
it
present
and
waiting
for
them
is
for
them
a
given
which
they
and
they
alone
possess
spirit
of
the
was
present
and
operative
before
any
of
the
present
members
of
it
came
into
it
is
they
of
course
who
keep
it
alive
and
preserve
it
so
the
same
spirit
will
continue
to
be
present
in
the
for
future
recruits
to
find
as
they
come
into
it
the
content
of
faith
is
to
be
presented
today
in
a
form
that
can
be
understanded
of
the
people
and
this
it
must
not
be
forgotten
is
one
of
the
goals
of
the
perennial
theological
task
there
is
no
other
choice
but
to
abandon
completely
a
mythological
manner
of
representation
does
not
mean
that
mythological
language
as
such
can
no
longer
be
used
in
theology
and
preaching
absurd
notion
that
demythologization
entails
the
expurgation
of
all
mythological
concepts
completely
misrepresents
intention
point
is
not
that
mythology
may
not
be
used
but
that
it
may
no
longer
be
regarded
as
the
only
or
even
the
most
appropriate
conceptuality
for
expressing
the
kerygma
we
say
that
a
mythological
mode
of
thought
must
be
completely
abandoned
we
mean
it
must
be
abandoned
as
the
sole
or
proper
means
for
presenting
the
understanding
of
existence
concepts
may
by
all
means
still
be
used
but
they
can
be
used
responsibly
only
as
symbols
or
ciphers
that
is
only
if
they
are
also
constantly
interpreted
in
nonmythological
or
existential
terms
statement
is
often
made
that
when
argues
in
this
way
he
overestimates
the
intellectual
which
myth
is
supposed
to
put
in
the
way
of
accepting
the
faith
this
statement
is
completely
unconvincing
own
definition
of
myth
is
strictly
adhered
to
and
it
is
interesting
that
this
is
almost
never
done
by
those
who
make
such
pronouncements
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
he
does
not
at
all
exaggerate
the
extent
to
which
the
mythological
concepts
of
traditional
theology
have
become
incredible
and
irrelevant
is
it
necessary
to
look
for
such
evidence
in
the
great
urban
centers
of
our
culture
that
are
admittedly
almost
entirely
secularized
and
so
profoundly
estranged
from
the
conventional
forms
in
which
the
gospel
has
been
communicated
the
contrary
even
in
the
heart
of
the
belt
itself
as
can
be
attested
by
any
one
who
is
called
to
work
there
the
industrial
and
technological
revolutions
have
long
been
under
way
together
with
the
corresponding
changes
in
picture
of
himself
and
his
world
fact
it
is
in
just
such
a
situation
that
the
profundity
of
argument
is
disclosed
the
theological
forms
of
the
past
continue
to
exist
in
a
way
they
do
not
in
a
more
secularized
situation
the
striking
thing
is
the
rapidity
with
which
they
are
being
reduced
to
a
marginal
existence
is
especially
in
evidence
among
the
present
generation
of
the
suburban
middle
class
and
again
in
counseling
and
teaching
one
encounters
members
of
this
group
whose
attempts
to
bring
into
some
kind
of
unity
the
insubstantial
mythologies
of
their
fundamentalist
heritage
and
the
stubborn
reality
of
the
modern
world
are
only
too
painfully
obvious
same
thing
is
also
evidenced
by
the
extreme
so
often
observed
to
characterize
the
preaching
and
teaching
of
the
churches
the
absence
of
a
truly
adequate
conceptuality
in
which
the
gospel
can
be
expressed
the
unavoidable
need
to
demythologize
it
makes
use
of
whatever
resources
are
at
hand
and
this
usually
means
one
or
another
of
the
various
forms
of
folk
religion
current
in
the
situation
is
not
to
say
that
the
only
explanation
of
the
present
infatuation
with
cult
of
reassurance
or
the
other
types
of
a
purely
cultural
is
the
need
for
a
demythologized
gospel
it
is
to
say
that
this
need
is
far
more
important
for
such
infatuation
than
most
of
the
pundits
seem
to
have
suspected
even
if
the
latent
demand
for
demythologization
is
not
nearly
as
widespread
as
we
are
claiming
at
least
among
the
cultured
elements
of
the
population
there
tends
to
be
an
almost
complete
indifference
to
the
church
and
its
traditional
message
of
sin
and
grace
be
sure
when
this
is
pointed
out
a
common
response
among
certain
churchmen
is
to
fulminate
about
the
little
flock
and
the
great
crowd
and
to
take
solace
from
castigation
of
the
wisdom
of
the
wise
in
the
opening
chapter
of
can
we
any
longer
afford
the
luxury
of
such
smug
indigation
the
church
risk
assuming
that
the
folly
of
men
is
as
dear
to
as
their
wisdom
or
as
is
also
commonly
implied
that
the
foolishness
of
and
the
foolishness
of
men
are
simply
two
ways
of
talking
about
the
same
thing
we
continue
to
alienate
precisely
those
whose
gifts
we
so
desperately
need
and
apart
from
whose
our
mission
in
the
world
must
become
increasingly
precarious
is
an
ancient
and
venerable
tradition
in
the
church
which
derives
however
from
the
heritage
of
the
rather
than
from
the
that
is
completely
independent
of
his
creation
and
so
has
no
need
of
men
for
accomplishing
his
work
in
the
world
analogy
the
church
also
has
been
regarded
as
entirely
independent
of
the
world
in
the
sense
of
requiring
nothing
from
it
in
order
to
be
the
church
as
everywhere
reminds
us
does
have
need
of
his
creatures
and
the
church
a
fortiori
can
ill
afford
to
do
without
the
talents
with
which
the
world
by
providence
presents
it
yet
this
is
exactly
the
risk
we
run
when
we
assume
as
we
too
often
do
that
we
can
continue
to
preach
the
gospel
in
a
form
that
makes
it
seem
incredible
and
irrelevant
to
cultured
men
we
translate
this
gospel
into
a
language
that
enlightened
men
today
can
understand
we
are
depriving
ourselves
of
the
very
resources
on
which
the
continued
success
of
our
witness
most
certainly
depends
arguing
in
this
way
we
are
obviously
taking
for
granted
that
a
demythologized
restatement
of
the
kerygma
can
be
achieved
and
that
we
firmly
believe
this
will
presently
become
evident
when
we
set
forth
reasons
to
justify
such
a
conviction
the
main
point
here
is
that
even
if
such
a
restatement
were
not
possible
the
demand
to
demythologize
the
kerygma
would
still
be
unavoidable
is
what
we
mean
when
we
say
this
demand
must
be
accepted
without
condition
to
be
a
means
to
say
yes
where
otherwise
say
no
or
where
do
not
have
the
right
to
say
anything
at
all
then
my
only
choice
is
to
refuse
to
be
a
differently
if
the
price
for
becoming
a
faithful
follower
of
is
some
form
of
whether
of
the
body
or
of
the
mind
sacrificium
corporis
sacrificium
intellectus
then
there
is
no
alternative
but
that
the
price
remain
unpaid
must
be
stressed
because
it
is
absolutely
essential
to
the
argument
of
this
concluding
chapter
man
as
has
told
us
has
come
of
age
and
though
this
process
by
no
means
represents
an
unambiguous
gain
and
is
in
fact
marked
by
the
estrangement
from
the
depths
that
seems
to
be
the
cost
of
human
maturation
it
is
still
a
positive
step
forward
and
those
of
us
who
so
richly
benefit
from
it
should
be
the
last
to
despise
it
any
event
it
is
an
irreversible
step
and
if
we
are
at
all
honest
with
ourselves
we
will
know
we
have
no
other
alternative
than
to
live
in
the
world
in
which
has
seen
fit
to
place
us
say
this
of
course
is
to
take
up
a
position
on
one
side
of
a
controversy
going
on
now
for
some
two
hundred
years
or
at
any
rate
since
the
beginning
of
the
distinctively
modern
period
in
theological
thought
have
aligned
ourselves
with
that
liberal
tradition
in
that
counts
among
the
great
names
in
its
history
those
of
and
and
more
recently
and
the
early
and
in
part
at
least
is
to
this
same
tradition
that
most
of
the
creative
figures
in
the
last
century
and
a
half
of
theology
also
belong
we
must
number
here
not
only
the
names
of
and
not
to
mention
those
of
the
and
but
those
of
the
brothers
and
if
may
claim
him
as
well
we
may
also
mention
the
several
members
of
the
neoliberal
movement
that
developed
at
the
of
and
is
heavily
indebted
philosophically
to
the
creative
work
of
makes
this
long
and
diverse
tradition
essentially
one
is
that
those
who
have
belonged
to
it
have
been
profoundly
in
earnest
about
being
modern
men
in
a
distinctively
modern
world
they
have
also
been
concerned
to
stand
squarely
within
the
tradition
of
the
apostolic
church
they
have
exhibited
no
willingness
whatever
to
sacrifice
their
modernity
to
their
have
insisted
rather
on
living
fully
and
completely
within
modern
culture
and
so
far
from
considering
this
treason
to
have
looked
upon
it
as
the
only
way
they
could
be
faithful
to
him
we
say
then
that
today
in
our
situation
the
demand
for
demythologization
must
be
accepted
without
condition
we
are
simply
saying
that
at
least
this
much
of
the
liberal
tradition
is
an
enduring
achievement
much
we
may
have
to
criticize
liberal
constructive
formulations
the
theology
we
ourselves
must
strive
to
formulate
can
only
go
beyond
liberalism
not
behind
it
affirming
this
we
have
already
taken
the
decisive
step
in
breaking
the
deadlock
into
which
attempt
to
formulate
such
a
theology
has
led
we
have
said
in
effect
that
of
the
two
alternatives
to
his
position
variously
represented
by
the
other
participants
in
the
demythologizing
discussion
only
one
is
really
an
alternative
the
demand
for
demythologization
is
unavoidable
and
so
must
be
accepted
by
theology
unconditionally
the
position
of
the
right
is
clearly
untenable
center
position
is
structurally
inconsistent
and
is
therefore
indefensible
on
formal
grounds
alone
the
general
position
of
the
right
as
represented
say
by
involves
the
rejection
or
at
least
qualification
of
the
demand
for
demythologization
and
so
is
invalidated
on
the
material
grounds
we
have
just
considered
follows
then
provided
the
possibilities
have
been
exhausted
that
the
only
real
alternative
is
the
general
viewpoint
of
the
left
which
has
been
represented
on
the
by
and
to
some
extent
at
least
is
found
in
much
that
is
significant
in
and
theology
order
to
make
the
implications
of
our
position
as
clear
as
possible
we
may
develop
this
argument
at
greater
length
may
show
first
that
there
cannot
possibly
be
an
alternative
other
than
the
three
typically
represented
by
and
do
this
it
is
sufficient
to
point
out
that
if
the
principle
in
terms
of
which
alternatives
are
to
be
conceived
is
such
as
to
exclude
more
than
two
then
the
question
of
a
third
possibility
is
a
meaningless
question
if
what
is
at
issue
is
whether
is
it
is
indifferent
whether
is
not
or
is
since
in
either
case
the
judgment
in
question
is
false
if
what
is
in
question
is
whether
in
a
given
theology
myth
is
or
is
not
completely
rejected
it
is
unimportant
whether
only
a
little
bit
of
myth
or
a
considerable
quantity
is
accepted
for
in
either
event
the
first
possibility
is
excluded
the
only
conceivable
alternatives
are
those
represented
on
the
one
hand
by
the
two
at
least
apparently
but
mutually
exclusive
positions
of
and
and
on
the
other
hand
by
the
third
but
really
pseudo
position
analogous
to
a
round
square
of
second
point
requires
more
extended
comment
will
be
recalled
from
the
discussion
in
that
the
position
of
the
right
as
represented
by
rests
on
the
following
thesis
only
tenable
alternative
to
position
is
a
theology
that
rejects
or
at
least
qualifies
his
unconditioned
demand
for
demythologization
and
existential
interpretation
accepts
instead
a
special
biblical
hermeneutics
or
method
of
interpretation
and
in
so
doing
frees
itself
to
give
appropriate
emphasis
to
the
event
by
means
of
statements
that
from
point
of
view
are
mythological
hundred
years
ago
there
existed
in
the
for
the
of
the
of
as
it
did
the
efforts
of
only
unauthorized
individuals
of
the
and
and
urging
a
communion
of
prayer
unacceptable
to
this
association
produced
little
fruit
and
in
fact
was
condemned
by
the
in
again
in
in
there
is
perhaps
nothing
in
the
religious
sphere
so
popularly
discussed
as
unity
was
enthusiastically
devoted
to
prayer
and
discussion
by
the
various
churches
people
seem
hopeful
yet
it
is
difficult
to
predict
whether
or
not
there
will
be
any
more
real
attainment
of
unity
in
than
there
was
in
it
must
be
readily
seen
that
the
religious
picture
in
has
so
greatly
changed
during
these
hundred
years
as
to
engender
hope
at
least
on
the
side
the
tide
is
well
on
the
turn

to

formed

some
of
my
own
personal
experiences

judgments

my
primary

to

been

on
this
number
but

here
feel
quite
certain
that
the

would
be
less
than

sides

that

are
badly

the

medieval

look

how
in

celebrated

the

to

falling

only
are
registered
on

rolls

roughly
only
a
tenth
of
them
continue
amazing
article
in
the
of

than
an
reported
last
month
that
in
the
of

there
are
churches
which
are
redundant
now
or
will
be
in
time
further
churches
have
been
demolished
since
in
the
last
five
years
the
chapel
committee
has
authorized
the
demolition
or
more
often
the
sale
of
chapels
of
these
former
churches
are
now
used
as
warehouses
but
neither
nor
object
to
selling
churches
to
and
have
done
so
it
must
be
said
that
these
same
have
built
some
new
churches
during
this
period
and
that
religious
population
shifts
have
emptied
churches
a
principal
reason
for
this
phenomenon
of
redundancy
is
that
fewer
are
going

be
admitted

there
is

been
my

to

to
hear
almost
everyone
in
church
congregations
reciting
the

there

that

of

medieval

always
strongly
resented

charge
of

not
seen
this
charge
made
during
my
stay
here
but
apparently
it
is
still
in
the
air

a
writer
in
a
recent
number
of
hyperbolically
states
that
of
the
myriad
imprecations
the
only
one
which
the
really
resent
is
the
suggestion
that
they
are
this
connection
it
has
been
observed
that
the
increasing
number
of
priests
and
laity
in
while
certainly
seen
as
good
for
is
nevertheless
a
source
of
embarrassment
for
some
of
the
more
nationalistic
especially
when
these
offer
to
remind
their
brethren
of
this
good
of
the
more
noteworthy
changes
that
have
taken
place
since

the
situation
of

and
one
hundred
years
ago
there
were
very
few
partly
because
religious
tests
were
removed
only
in
for
those
few
there
was
almost
no
ecclesiastical
representation
in
the
city
to
care
for
their
religious
needs
not
only
are
there
considerably
more
laity
as
students
and
professors
at
but
there
are
also
numerous
houses
of
religious
orders
existing
in
respectable
and
friendly
relations

of

seminarians
attend

evidence
that

a
more
favorable
position
today
than
in

the
respectful
attention
given
to
it
in
the
mass
media
of

of
articles
appearing
in

important

though
somewhat
superficially
drawn
easily
came
out
the
best
were
many
letters
of
strong
protest
against
the
portrait
of
the
clergyman
who
was
indeed
portrayed
as
a
man
not
particularly
concerned
with
religious
matters
and
without
really
very
much
to
do
as
clergyman
a
series
of
articles
was
certainly
never
printed
in
the
public
press
of
was
so
much
interest
shown
in
this
venture
that
it
was
continued
on
where
comments
were
equally
made
by
an
parson
a
minister
and
a
priest
priests
have
frequently
appeared
on
television
programs
sometimes
discussing
the
faith
on
an
equal
footing
with
clergymen
notable
example
of
this
was
the
discussion
of
unity
by
the
of

the
of
recently
appointed

good
feeling
which
exists
between

times
in

months
it
was
interesting
to
observe
that

course
the
crowning
event
that
has
dramatically
upset
the
traditional
pattern
of

the

the
first
time

done
this
since
the
century
reacted
to
this
event
with
moderate
but
real
hope
daily
something
is
reported
which
feeds
this
hope
in
statistics
of
the
increasing
numbers
of
converts
and
immigrants
news
of
a
minister
in

offered
to

that
a
nun
had
been
requested
to
teach
in
a
secondary
school
during
the
sickness
of
one
of
its
masters
the
startling
statement
in
a
respectable
periodical
that
if
the
present

is
still
in
operation
will
constitute
almost
of
the

the
next
generation

no
church

this
concurrence
of
the

the
universal
as
clearly
or
formulated
it
as
precisely
as

the
has
to

individual
with

own
he
dare
not
be
a
cosmic
aeon
that
swoops
to
earth
for
a
while
but
never
identifies
itself
with

this
utterly
individual
historical
person
must
also
contain
within
himself
the
common
history
of
mankind
history
is
his

each
man
must
recognize
his

death

identified
himself
with
human
history
and
human
death
coming
as
the
head
of
a
new
humanity
a
circle
then
nor
a
straight
line
but
a
spiral
represents
the
shape
of
death
as
sees
it
for
a
spiral
has
motion
as
well
as
recurrence
represented
by
a
spiral
history
may
in
some
sense
be
said
to
repeat
itself
yet
each
historical
event
remains
unique
is
both
unique
and
universal
first
turn
of
the
spiral
is
the
primeval
history
of
humanity
in
interprets
the
end
of
history
on
the
basis
of
its
beginning
so
portrays
the
story
of
on
the
basis
of
the
story
of
then
comes
the
substance
of
the
first
man
and
and
from
virgin
earth
had
not
rained
says
the
before
man
was
made
and
there
was
no
man
to
till
the
earth
this
earth
then
while
it
was
still
virgin
took
dust
and
fashioned
the
man
the
beginning
of
humanity
does
not
regard
and
merely
as
private
individuals
but
as
universal
human
beings
who
were
and
are
all
of
humanity
and
were
perfect
not
in
the
sense
that
they
possessed
perfection
but
in
the
sense
that
they
were
capable
of
development
toward
perfection
were
in
fact
children
does
not
claim
for
the
human
soul
therefore
there
is
no
need
for
him
as
there
is
for
to
identify
existence
itself
with
the
fall
is
created
and
willed
by
and
is
not
the
consequence
of
a
rebellion
or
of
a
cosmic
descent
from
eternity
into
history
existence
is
a
created
good
biblical
symbol
for
this
affirmation
is
expressed
in
the
words
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
similitude
of
he
created
him
are
some
passages
in
the
writings
of
where
the
image
of
and
the
similitude
are
sharply
distinguished
so
most
notably
in
the
statement
the
is
absent
from
the
soul
such
a
man
is
indeed
of
an
animal
nature
and
being
left
carnal
he
will
be
an
imperfect
being
possessing
the
image
of
in
his
formation
but
not
receiving
the
similitude
of
through
the
the
image
of
is
that
which
makes
a
man
a
man
and
not
an
oyster
the
similitude
of
by
contrast
is
that
which
makes
a
man
a
child
of
and
not
merely
a
rational
creature
research
on
however
makes
it
evident
that
he
does
not
consistently
maintain
this
distinction
does
not
mean
to
say
that
lost
the
similitude
of
and
his
immortality
through
the
fall
for
he
was
created
not
exactly
immortal
nor
yet
exactly
mortal
but
capable
of
immortality
as
well
as
of
mortality
describes
creation
as
follows
that
the
man
should
not
have
thoughts
of
grandeur
and
become
lifted
up
as
if
he
had
no
lord
because
of
the
dominion
that
had
been
given
to
him
and
the
freedom
fall
into
sin
against
his
overstepping
his
bounds
and
take
up
an
attitude
of
arrogance
towards
a
law
was
given
him
by
that
he
might
know
that
he
had
for
lord
the
lord
of
all
laid
down
for
him
certain
conditions
so
that
if
he
kept
the
command
of
then
he
would
always
remain
as
he
was
that
is
immortal
but
if
he
did
not
he
would
become
mortal
melting
into
earth
whence
his
frame
had
been
taken
conditions
man
did
not
keep
and
thus
he
became
mortal
yet
he
did
not
stop
being
human
as
a
result
is
no
justification
for
systematizing
the
random
statements
of
about
the
image
of
beyond
this
nor
for
reading
into
his
imprecise
usage
the
later
theological
distinction
between
the
image
of
humanity
and
the
similitude
of
immortality
was
created
with
the
capacity
for
immortality
but
the
promise
of
immortality
in
exchange
for
disobedience
cost
his
immortality
was
in
the
words
of
beguiled
by
another
under
the
pretext
of
immortality
true
way
to
immortality
lay
through
obedience
but
man
did
not
believe
this
was
disobedient
for
she
did
not
obey
when
as
yet
she
was
a
virgin
even
as
she
having
indeed
a
husband
but
being
nevertheless
as
yet
a
virgin
having
become
disobedient
was
made
the
cause
of
death
both
to
herself
and
to
the
entire
human
race
so
also
did
having
a
man
betrothed
to
her
and
being
nevertheless
a
virgin
by
yielding
obedience
become
the
cause
of
salvation
both
to
herself
and
the
whole
human
race
he
interprets
the
primitive
state
of
man
as
one
of
mere
potentiality
or
capacity
and
believes
that
and
were
created
as
children
often
seems
inclined
to
extenuate
their
disobedience
as
being
due
no
doubt
to
carelessness
but
still
wicked
interpretation
of
the
beginning
on
the
basis
of
the
end
prompts
him
to
draw
these
parallels
between
the
and
the
parallelism
affects
his
picture
of
disobedience
too
for
as
it
was
the
of
who
came
to
rescue
man
so
it
was
disobedience
to
the
word
of
in
the
beginning
that
brought
death
into
the
world
and
all
our
woe
this
act
of
disobedience
and
not
with
the
inception
of
his
individual
existence
man
began
the
downward
circuit
on
the
spiral
of
history
descending
from
the
created
capacity
for
immortality
to
an
inescapable
mortality
the
nadir
of
that
circuit
is
death
with
the
fruit
they
did
also
fall
under
the
power
of
death
because
they
did
eat
in
disobedience
and
disobedience
to
entails
death
as
they
became
forfeit
to
death
from
that
moment
they
were
handed
over
to
it
leads
to
the
somewhat
startling
notion
that
and
died
on
the
same
day
that
they
disobeyed
namely
on
a
as
a
parallel
to
the
death
of
on
he
sees
a
parallel
also
to
the
day
of
preparation
for
the
any
case
though
they
had
been
promised
immortality
if
they
ate
of
the
tree
they
obtained
mortality
instead
wages
of
sin
is
death
life
originally
shaped
for
immortality
and
for
communion
with
must
now
be
conformed
to
the
shape
of
death
even
at
the
nadir
of
the
circuit
the
spiral
of
history
belongs
to
and
he
still
rules
death
therefore
has
a
providential
as
well
as
a
punitive
function
also
drove
him
man
out
of
and
removed
him
far
from
the
tree
of
life
not
because
envied
him
the
tree
of
life
as
some
venture
to
assert
but
because
pitied
him
and
did
not
desire
that
he
should
continue
a
sinner
for
ever
nor
that
the
sin
which
surrounded
him
should
be
immortal
and
evil
interminable
and
irremediable
set
a
bound
to
his
state
of
sin
by
interposing
death
and
thus
causing
sin
to
cease
putting
an
end
to
it
by
the
dissolution
of
the
flesh
which
should
take
place
in
the
earth
so
that
man
ceasing
at
length
to
live
in
sin
and
dying
to
it
might
live
to
idea
which
occurs
in
both
and
fits
especially
well
into
the
scheme
of
theology
for
it
prepares
the
way
for
the
passage
from
life
through
death
to
life
that
is
achieved
in
man
can
live
only
by
dying
so
it
was
only
by
his
dying
that
could
bring
many
to
life
is
probably
fair
to
say
that
the
idea
of
death
is
more
profound
in
than
the
idea
of
sin
is
applies
to
his
picture
of
is
borne
out
also
by
the
absence
of
any
developed
theory
about
how
sin
passes
from
one
generation
to
the
next
becomes
most
evident
in
his
description
of
as
the
second
who
does
indeed
come
to
destroy
sin
but
whose
work
culminates
in
the
achievement
of
immortality
emphasis
upon
death
rather
than
sin
as
fundamental
problem
shares
with
many
early
theologians
especially
the
ones
speak
of
the
work
of
as
the
bestowal
of
incorruptibility
which
can
mean
though
it
does
not
have
to
mean
deliverance
from
time
and
history
reminds
man
of
his
sin
but
it
reminds
him
also
of
his
transience
represents
a
punishment
that
he
knows
he
deserves
but
it
also
symbolizes
most
dramatically
that
he
lives
his
life
within
the
process
of
time
two
aspects
of
death
cannot
be
successfully
separated
but
they
dare
not
be
confused
or
identified
repeated
efforts
in
history
to
describe
death
as
altogether
the
consequence
of
human
sin
show
that
these
two
aspects
of
death
cannot
be
separated
efforts
almost
always
find
themselves
compelled
to
ask
whether
was
created
capable
of
growing
old
and
then
older
and
then
still
older
in
short
whether
life
was
intended
to
be
part
of
the
process
of
time
it
was
then
it
must
have
been
intention
to
translate
him
at
a
certain
point
from
time
to
eternity
night
so
some
of
these
theories
run
would
have
fallen
asleep
much
as
he
fell
asleep
for
the
creation
of
and
thus
he
would
have
been
carried
over
into
the
life
eternal
embarrassment
of
these
theories
over
the
naturalness
of
death
is
an
illustration
of
the
thesis
that
death
cannot
be
only
a
punishment
for
some
termination
seems
necessary
in
a
life
that
is
lived
within
the
natural
order
of
time
and
change
the
other
hand
faith
knows
that
death
is
more
than
the
natural
termination
of
temporal
existence
is
the
wages
of
sin
and
its
sting
is
the
law
this
aspect
of
death
as
punishment
is
not
distinguished
from
the
idea
of
death
as
natural
termination
the
conclusion
seems
inevitable
that
temporal
existence
itself
is
a
form
of
punishment
rather
than
the
state
into
which
man
is
put
by
the
will
of
the
seems
to
have
been
the
conclusion
to
which
was
forced
death
receives
more
than
its
share
of
attention
from
the
theologian
and
if
sin
receives
less
than
its
share
the
gift
of
the
life
eternal
through
begins
to
look
like
the
divinely
appointed
means
of
rescue
from
temporal
created
existence
an
interpretation
of
death
radically
alters
the
view
of
creation
for
it
teaches
salvation
from
not
salvation
in
time
and
history
teaches
not
only
salvation
in
history
but
salvation
by
the
history
of
such
an
interpretation
of
death
would
require
a
drastic
revision
of
the
understanding
of
the
work
of
as
an
encouragement
to
revisionist
thinking
it
manifestly
is
fair
to
admit
that
any
fraternity
has
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
accept
persons
it
dislikes
clergy
were
an
exclusive
club
of
cultivated
gentlemen
as
the
term
was
then
understood
in
the
and
was
definitely
not
a
gentleman
either
in
theology
or
in
manners
an
honorable
representative
of
the
sanhedrin
addressed
himself
frankly
to
the
issue
in
insisting
that
should
not
be
persecuted
or
calumniated
and
that
in
this
republic
no
power
to
restrain
him
by
force
could
exist
so
judiciously
argued
the
could
legitimately
decide
that
should
not
be
encouraged
nor
assisted
in
diffusing
his
opinions
by
those
who
differ
from
him

to
their
correctness
today
are
not
entitled
to
excoriate
honest
men
who
believed
to
be
downright
pernicious
and
who
barred
their
pulpits
against
his
demand
to
poison
the
minds
of
their
congregations
can
even
argue
though
this
is
a
delicate
matter
that
every
justification
existed
for
their
returning

to

so
to
suppress
it
rather
than
let
use
it
as
a
sounding
board
for
his
propaganda
when
his
turn
should
come
to
occupy
it
it
did
seem
clear
as
day
to
these
clergymen
as
son
explained
in
the
biography
of
his
father
they
had
always
contended
for
the
propriety
of
their
claim
to
the

liberty

never

extreme
of

affection

an
uneasy
conscience
liberalism

reminded
of
the
dramatic
confrontation
of

on
while
it

defend
the

requested
to
visit
him
whereupon
our
burly
again
burst
into
tears
this
near
tragedy
which
to
us
borders
on
comedy
enables
us
to
tell
the
story
over
and
over
again
always
warming
ourselves
with
a
glow
of
complacency
was
indeed
a
near
thing
but
somehow
the
inherent
decency
of
which
we
inherit
did
triumph
was
never
excommunicated
the
extent
that
he
was
ostracized
or
even
reviled
we
solace
ourselves
by
saying
he
asked
for
it
even
after
all
these
stratagems
the
conscience
of
liberality
is
still
not
laid
to
rest
any
more
than
is
the
conscience
of
for
having
done
the
abject
penance
for
its
rejection
of
of
naming
its
hall
of
philosophy
after
him
both
cases
the
stubborn
fact
remains
liberalism
gave
birth
to
two
brilliant
apostates
both
legitimate
offspring
of
its
loins
and
when
brought
to
the
test
it
behaved
shabbily
they
both
had
ventured
into
realms
which
their
colleagues
thought
infidel
is
this
the
way
gentlemen
settle
frank
differences
of
opinion
it
after
all
possible
that
no
matter
how
the
liberals
trumpet
their
confidence
in
human
dignity
they
are
exposed
to
a
contagion
of
fear
more
insidious
than
any
conservative
has
ever
to
worry
about
there
is
a
crucial
difference
between
the
two
histories
evaded
the
problem
by
shoving
it
aside
or
rather
by
leaving
it
behind
him
he
walked
out
of
the
communion
so
that
it
could
lick
the
wound
of
his
departure
preserve
its
and
eventually
accord
him
pious
veneration
insisted
upon
not
resigning
even
when
the
majority
wanted
him
to
depart
upon
daring
the
to
throw
him
out
he
was
in
his
lifetime
as
is
the
memory
of
him
afterwards
a
canker
within
the
liberal
sensitivity
still
points
an
accusing
finger
at
all
of
us
telling
us
we
have
neither
the
courage
to
support
him
nor
the
energy
to
cut
his
throat
the
dispute
between
and
the
society
of
his
time
both
ecclesiastical
and
social
was
a
real
one
a
bitter
one
cannot
be
smoothed
over
by
now
cherishing
his
sarcasms
as
delightful
bits
of
or
by
solemnly
calling
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
justice
of
the
objections
to
him
fact
is
incontestable
that
liberal
world
of
was
intellectually
sterile
smug
afraid
of
the
logical
consequences
of
its
own
mild
ventures
into
iconoclasm
and
quite
prepared
to
resort
to
hysterical
repressions
when
its
brittle
foundations
were
threatened
along
with
and
showed
a
magnificent
moral
bravery
when
facing
mobs
mobilized
in
defense
of
the
and
slavery
we
can
find
reasons
for
respecting
even
the
bigotry
of
the
populace
their
passions
were
genuine
and
the
division
between
them
and
the
abolitionists
is
as
the
minister
within
the
pale
of
a
church
which
had
proclaimed
itself
the
repository
of
liberality
poses
a
different
problem
which
is
not
to
be
resolved
by
holding
him
up
as
the
champion
of
freedom
though
his
theological
theses
have
become
to
us
commonplaces
the
fundamental
interrogation
he
phrased
is
very
much
with
us
has
been
endlessly
rephrased
but
may
here
put
it
thus
at
what
point
do
the
tolerant
find
themselves
obliged
to
become
intolerant
then
as
they
become
aware
that
they
have
reached
the
end
of
their
patience
what
do
they
to
their
dismay
learn
for
the
first
time
about
themselves
can
be
no
doubt
the
of
that
era
could
be
exquisitely
cruel
in
enforcing
its
canons
of
behavior
gentle
revered
by
all
orthodox
or
wrote
to
a
friend
in
that
among
its
many
virtues
did
not
abound
in
a
tolerant
spirit
that
the
yoke
of
opinion
crushed
individuality
of
judgment
and
action
city
in
the
world
is
governed
so
little
by
a
police
and
so
much
by
mutual
inspections
and
what
is
called
public
sentiment
stand
more
in
awe
of
one
another
than
most
people
is
less
individual
or
runs
more
into
masses
and
often
rules
with
a
rod
of
iron
more
poignantly
and
with
the
insight
of
a
genius
added
remember
this
is
not
that
should
a
minister
in
trust
himself
to
his
heart
should
he
speak
without
book
and
consequently
break
some
law
of
speech
or
be
hurried
into
some
daring
hyperbole
he
should
find
little
mercy
wrote
this
in
a
letter
think
it
fair
to
say
that
he
never
quite
reached
such
candor
in
his
sermons
commencing
his
mission
to
the
disguised
as
the
minister
of
a
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
polities
descended
from
the
founders
among
which
were
still
the
churches
made
explicit
from
the
beginning
that
the
conflict
between
him
and
the
society
was
not
something
which
could
be
evaporated
into
a
genteel
difference
about
clerical
decorum
he
spoke
openly
with
what
had
prophesied
someone
might
with
daring
hyperbole
vindicated
further
prophecy
that
he
who
committed
this
infraction
of
taste
would
promptly
discover
how
little
mercy
liberals
were
disposed
to
allow
to
libertarians
who
appeared
to
them
libertines
institutionalized
liberalism
proved
itself
fundamentally
an
institution
and
only
within
those
defined
limits
a
license
reminding
ourselves
of
these
factors
in
the
situation
we
should
am
sure
come
to
a
fresh
realization
however
painful
it
be
that
the
battle
between
and
his
neighbors
was
fought
in
earnest
arraigned
the
citizens
in
language
of
so
little
courtesy
that
they
had
to
respond
with
at
the
least
resentment
otherwise
could
the
lawyer
doctor
minister
the
men
of
science
and
letters
do
when
told
that
they
had
become
the
cherubim
and
seraphim
and
the
three
archangels
who
stood
before
the
golden
throne
of
the
merchant
and
continually
cried
holy
holy
is
the
when
we
recollect
how
sensitive
were
the
emotions
of
the
old
stock
in
regard
to
the
recent
tides
of
immigration
should
we
be
astonished
that
their
thin
lips
were
compressed
into
a
white
line
of
rage
as
snarled
at
them
thus
about
the
voting
as
the
bishop
tells
the
for
it
and
do
the
same
thing
are
a
great
many
bishops
who
have
never
had
a
cross
on
their
bosom
nor
a
mitre
on
their
head
who
appeal
not
to
the
authority
of
the
at
but
to
the
a
pope
much
nearer
home
has
been
controlled
by
a
few
capitalists
lawyers
and
other
managers
who
told
the
editors
what
to
say
and
the
preachers
what
to
think
was
war
meant
business
he
took
repeated
care
to
let
his
colleagues
know
that
he
intended
them
the
churches
have
caught
the
malaria
and
are
worse
than
those
who
deceived
them
which
implied
that
they
were
very
bad
indeed
was
he
said
that
his
parents
had
given
him
as
a
rule
beyond
even
the
love
that
suffused
his
being
and
the
sense
of
humor
with
which
he
was
largely
supplied
and
it
was
duty
he
would
perform
though
it
cost
him
acute
pain
and
exhausted
him
by
the
age
of
fifty
could
weep
and
he
wept
astonishingly
often
and
on
the
slightest
provocation
but
the
psychology
of
those
tears
was
entirely
compatible
with
a
remorseless
readiness
to
massacre
his
opponents
it
gave
me
pleasure
to
say
hard
things
he
wrote
would
shut
up
forever
have
to
tell
ourselves
that
when
spoke
in
this
vein
he
believed
what
he
said
because
he
could
continue
the
truth
which
cost
me
bitter
tears
to
say
must
speak
though
it
cost
other
tears
hotter
than
fire
he
copiously
shed
his
own
tears
and
yielded
himself
up
as
a
living
sacrifice
to
the
impersonalized
conscience
of
he
was
not
disturbed
by
the
havoc
he
worked
in
other
consciences
endeavor
to
capture
even
a
faint
sense
of
how
strenuous
was
the
fight
is
muffled
by
our
indifference
to
the
very
issue
which
in
the
of
seemed
to
be
the
central
hope
of
its
survival
that
of
the
literal
factual
historicity
of
the
miracles
as
reported
in
the
is
idle
to
ask
why
we
are
no
longer
disturbed
if
somebody
professing
the
deepest
piety
decides
anew
that
it
is
of
no
importance
whether
or
not
transformed
the
water
into
wine
at
eleven
on
the
third
of
have
no
answer
as
to
why
we
are
not
alarmed
we
are
the
more
prepared
to
give
the
credit
for
having
taken
the
right
side
in
an
unnecessary
controversy
to
salute
his
courage
and
to
pass
on
happily
forgetting
both
him
and
the
entire
episode
have
not
the
leisure
or
the
patience
or
the
skill
to
comprehend
what
was
working
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
a
then
recent
graduate
from
the
who
would
muster
the
audacity
to
contradict
his
most
formidable
instructor
the
majesterial
by
saying
that
while
he
believed
like
other
religious
teachers
worked
miracles
see
not
how
a
miracle
proves
a
doctrine
have
within
the
past
fifty
years
come
out
of
all
uncertainty
into
a
faith
which
is
a
dominating
conviction
of
the
and
about
which
have
not
a
shadow
of
doubt
has
been
my
lot
all
through
life
to
associate
with
eminent
scientists
and
at
times
to
discuss
with
them
the
deepest
and
most
vital
of
all
questions
the
nature
of
the
hope
of
a
life
beyond
this
have
also
constantly
engaged
in
scientific
work
and
am
fully
aware
of
the
value
of
opinions
formed
in
science
as
well
as
in
the
religions
in
the
world
an
amateurish
yet
in
a
very
real
sense
have
followed
the
developments
of
archaeology
geology
astronomy
herpetology
and
mycology
with
a
hearty
appreciation
of
the
advances
being
made
in
these
fields
one
time
became
disturbed
in
the
faith
in
which
had
grown
up
by
the
apparent
inroads
being
made
upon
both
and
by
a
of
the
to
refute
which
felt
the
need
of
a
better
knowledge
of
and
of
archaeology
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
to
pull
out
some
of
the
props
of
our
faith
was
to
weaken
the
entire
structure
thus
inculcated
left
me
floundering
for
a
while
and
like
some
higher
critical
friends
trying
to
continue
to
use
the
as
the
of
while
at
the
same
time
holding
it
to
have
been
subjected
to
a
vast
number
of
redactions
and
interpolations
attempting
to
bridge
the
chasm
between
an
older
reverent
generation
and
a
critical
doubting
race
still
aware
of
a
great
light
and
glow
of
warmth
in
the
stood
outside
shivering
in
the
cold
one
thing
the
higher
critics
like
the
modernists
however
overreached
themselves
in
claiming
that
the
of
was
not
written
in
time
but
well
after
the
first
century
perhaps
as
late
as
if
any
part
of
the
is
assuredly
the
very
of
speaking
through
servant
it
is
ask
me
to
believe
that
so
inexpressibly
marvelous
a
book
was
written
long
after
all
the
events
by
some
admiring
follower
and
was
not
inspired
directly
by
the
of

asking
me
to
accept
a
miracle
far
greater
than
any
of
those
recorded
in
the
took
my
leave
of
my
learned
friends
to
step
out
on
another
path
to
which
we
might
give
the
modern
name
of
or
the
thing
that
works
it
try
it
and
if
it
works
accept
it
as
a
guiding
principle
put
my
to
the
practical
test
of
noting
what
it
says
about
itself
and
then
tested
it
to
see
how
it
worked
a
short
possibly
not
the
best
method
looked
up
in
the
and
noted
that
the
claims
from
to
to
be
personal
message
to
man
next
traditional
step
then
was
to
accept
it
as
the
authoritative
textbook
of
the
faith
just
as
one
would
accept
a
treatise
on
any
earthly
science
and
submitted
to
its
conditions
according
to
invitation
and
promise
that
any
man
will
do
his
will
he
shall
know
of
the
doctrine
whether
it
be
of
or
whether
speak
of
myself
outcome
of
such
an
experiment
has
been
in
due
time
the
acceptance
of
the
as
the
of
inspired
in
a
sense
utterly
different
from
any
merely
human
book
and
with
it
the
acceptance
of
our
as
the
only
begotten
of
of
by
the
the
of
the
world
believe
therefore
that
we
are
without
exception
sinners
by
nature
alienated
from

that
the
of

to
earth
the
representative
of
a
new
race
to
die
upon
the
cross
and
pay
the
penalty
of
the
sin
of
the
world
and
that
he
who
thus
receives
as
his
personal
is
born
again
spiritually
with
new
privileges
appetites
and
affections
destined
to
live
and
grow
in

forever

any
man
save
himself
by
good
works
or
by
a
commendable
moral
life
although
such
works
are
the
natural
fruits
and
evidences
of

and
naturally

such
avenues

stood
at
the
bedside
of
my
patient
one
day
and
beheld
a
very
sick
man
in
terrible
pain
ministered
to
his
needs
noticed
that
his
face
was
radiant
in
spite
of
his
suffering
and
learned
that
he
was
trusting
not
only
in
the
skill
of
his
doctor
and
nurse
but
also
the
his
heart
he
had
that
peace
of

the
spoke

said

tendered
by

about
to

for

who
has
that
peace
through
faith

my
work
a
great
deal
easier

be
able

pray
for
the

you
can
tell
that
many
of

running

from
something
one
of

speaks
of
this
mania
for
diversion
as
being
a
sign
of
misery
and
fear
which
man
cannot
endure
without
such
opiates
and
as

is
increasing

a

so
many
new

to
fear
in

of
nuclear

dreadful
things
which
are
too
horrible
to
contemplate
doubt
that
fear
parties
and
group
confessionals
will
help
very
much
we
do
get
our
fears
out
in
the
open
what
then
that
where
most
of
them
are
already
right
out
on
the
front
page
of
our
newspapers
we
are
talking
about
them
too
much
question
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
them
the
enemy
will
capitalize
on
our
fears
if
he
can
did
just
that
years
ago
building
up
tensions
that
first
led
to
a
and
then
to
a
world
war
fear
of
war
can
make
us
either
too
weak
to
stand
and
too
willing
to
compromise
or
too
reckless
and
too
nervous
to
negotiate
for
peace
as
long
as
there
is
any
chance
to
negotiate
is
said
that
fear
in
human
beings
produces
an
odor
that
provokes
animals
to
attack
could
have
the
same
effect
on
of
the
has
said
will
never
negotiate
out
of
fear
and
we
will
never
fear
to
negotiate
is
a
sound
position
but
it
is
important
that
shall
recognize
it
not
merely
as
the
word
of
a
president
but
as
the
mind
of
a
free
people
who
are
not
afraid
another
reason
why
it
is
imperative
for
us
these
days
to
conquer
our
fears
to
develop
the
poise
that
promotes
peace
to
the
of
we
find
the
only
sure
way
to
do
that
you
read
those
beautiful
words
which
you
must
have
in
your
heart
if
you
are
to
master
the
fears
that
surround
you
or
to
drive
them
out
if
they
have
you
in
their
grip
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
fear
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
be
afraid
you
say
those
are
beautiful
words
all
right
but
it
was
easy
for
the
psalmist
to
sing
them
in
his
day
live
in
a
world
of
perpetual
peril
like
ours

anything
about
the
problems
we
face
today
the
next
two
verses
the
wicked
even
mine
enemies
and
my
foes
came
upon
me
to
eat
up
my
flesh
they
stumbled
and
fell
an
host
should
encamp
against
me
my
heart
shall
not
fear
though
war
should
rise
against
me
in
this
will
be
confident
is
almost
a
perfect
description
of
the
predicament
in
which
we
find
ourselves

us

but
their
souls

shooting
them
to
death
if
they
try
to
escape
their

indeed
we
too
can
see
a
warlike
host
of
infidels

against
us

terrible
thing

really
they
are
right
next
door
are
all
involved
in
them
deeply
involved
nobody
knows
what
comes
next
live
from
crisis
to
crisis
there
is
only
one
way
for
a
man
to
conquer
his
fears
in
such
a
world
must
learn
to
say
with
true
faith
what
the
psalmist
said
in
a
similar
world
is
my
light
and
my
salvation
whom
shall
fear
is
the
strength
of
my
life
of
whom
shall
be
afraid
that
this
man
had
a
threefold
conception
of
which
is
the
secret
of
his
faith
the
is
my
light
lived
in
a
very
dark
world
but
he
was
not
in
the
dark
same
who
called
this
world
into
being
when
said
there
be
light
those
were
very
first
creative
words
began
the
world
with
light
this
still
gives
light
to
a
world
which
man
has
plunged
into
darkness
those
who
put
their
trust
in
still
says
every
day
again
there
be
light
there
is
light
fact
came
into
this
world
in
the
person
of
who
stood
here
amid
the
darkness
of
human
sin
and
said
am
the
light
of
the
world
he
that
followeth
me
shall
not
walk
in
darkness
but
shall
have
the
light
of
life
psalmist
could
say
that
was
his
light
even
though
he
could
only
anticipate
the
coming
of
lived
in
the
dawn
he
could
only
see
the
light
coming
over
the
horizon
live
in
the
bright
daylight
of
that
great
event
for
us
it
is
a
fact
in
history
should
we
not
have
the
same
faith
and
an
even
greater
experience
of
the
light
which
it
gives
is
the
faith
that
moved
the
psalmist
to
add
his
second
conception
of
is
my
salvation
knew
that
his
would
save
him
from
his
enemies
because
had
saved
him
from
his
sins
could
do
that
could
do
anything
enemies
at
his
gate
threatening
to
eat
up
his
flesh
were
nothing
compared
with
the
enemy
of
sin
within
his
own
soul
had
conquered
that
one
by
grace
why
worry
about
all
the
others
apostle
said
the
same
thing
in
the
language
and
faith
of
the
that
spared
not
own
but
delivered
up
for
us
all
how
shall
not
with
freely
give
us
all
things
be
for
us
who
can
be
against
us
shall
separate
us
from
the
love
of
tribulation
or
distress
or
persecution
or
famine
or
nakedness
or
peril
or
sword
is
the
key
to
the
conquest
of
fear
gets
down
to
the
heart
of
our
problem
for
it
reconciles
us
with
whom
we
fear
most
of
all
because
we
have
sinned
against
that
fear
has
been
removed
by
faith
in
when
we
know
that
is
our
that
has
paid
our
debt
with
blood
that
has
met
the
demands
of
justice
and
thus
has
turned
wrath
away
when
we
know
that
we
have
peace
with
in
our
hearts
and
then
with
this
on
our
side
we
can
face
the
whole
world
without
fear
so
the
psalmist
gives
us
one
more
picture
of
is
the
strength
of
my
life
word
is
really
stronghold
recalls
those
words
of
another
psalm
is
our
refuge
and
strength
a
very
present
help
in
trouble
will
not
we
fear
though
the
earth
be
removed
and
though
the
mountains
be
carried
into
the
midst
of
the
sea
behold
the
works
of
the
what
desolations
hath
made
in
the
earth
again
we
have
no
real
evidence
on
this
from
that
quarter
until
the
close
of
the
ninth
century
when
an
scholar
is
said
to
have
discussed
the
magic
square
of
three
while
it
remains
possible
that
the
the
may
perhaps
have
had
the
magic
square
of
three
before
the
did
more
definite
evidence
will
have
to
turn
up
from
the
or
the
before
can
lose
her
claim
to
the
earliest
known
magic
square
by
more
than
a
thousand
years
square
as
an
expression
of
centrality
concept
of
the
at
peace
strong
and
united
under
a
forceful
ruler
which
had
been
only
a
ideal
in
the
time
of
the
was
finally
realized
by
the
establishment
of
a
under
the
dynasty
this
was
only
accomplished
by
excessive
cruelty
and
extremes
of
totalitarian
despotism
the
many
severe
measures
taken
by
the
in
his
efforts
to
insure
the
continuation
of
this
national
unity
was
the
burning
of
the
books
in
with
the
expressed
intention
of
removing
possible
sources
for
divergent
thinking
but
as
he
had
a
special
fondness
for
magic
and
divination
he
ordered
that
books
on
these
subjects
should
be
spared
of
the
latter
were
destroyed
in
their
turn
during
the
burning
of
the
vast
palace
some
ten
years
later
yet
some
must
have
survived
because
the
old
interest
in
number
symbolism
divination
and
magic
persisted
on
into
the
dynasty
which
succeeded
in
reuniting
and
keeping
it
together
for
a
longer
period
from
to
fact
during
the
first
century
an
extensive
literature
sprang
up
devoted
to
these
subjects
finding
its
typical
expression
in
the
wei
books
a
number
of
which
were
specifically
devoted
to
the
and
related
numerical
diagrams
especially
in
connection
with
divination
the
wei
books
were
also
destroyed
in
a
series
of
purges
which
culminated
in
a
final
proscription
in
all
this
destruction
of
old
literature
it
should
be
obvious
why
we
have
so
little
information
about
the
early
history
and
development
of
the
which
was
already
semisecret
anyhow
in
spite
of
all
this
enough
evidence
remains
to
show
that
the
magic
square
of
three
must
indeed
have
been
the
object
of
a
rather
extensive
cult
or
series
of
cults
reaching
fullest
expression
in
the
period
modern
scholars
have
expressed
surprise
that
the
simple
magic
square
of
three
a
mere
mathematical
puzzle
was
able
to
exert
a
considerable
influence
on
the
minds
and
imaginations
of
the
cultured
for
so
many
centuries
they
could
have
found
most
of
the
answers
right
within
the
square
itself
up
to
now
no
one
has
attempted
to
analyze
its
inherent
mathematical
properties
or
the
numerical
significance
of
its
numbers
singly
or
in
combination
and
then
tried
to
consider
these
in
the
light
of
cosmological
concepts
an
analysis
speedily
reveals
why
the
middle
number
of
the
was
so
vitally
significant
for
the
ever
since
the
earliest
hints
that
they
had
a
knowledge
of
this
diagram
importance
of
this
can
largely
be
explained
by
the

number

its
special
relationship
to
all
the
rest
of

numbers
quite
apart
from
any
numerological
considerations
which
is
to
say
any
symbolic
meaning
arbitrarily
assigned
to
it
mathematically
speaking
it
was
both
functionally
and
symbolically
the
most
important
number
in
the
entire

one
takes
the
middle
number
and
multiplies
it
by
the
base
number
of
the
magic
square
of

the
result
is
which
is
also
the
constant
sum
of
all

rows
columns

the

of

not
only
the
physical
mean
between
every
opposing
pair
of
the
other
numbers
by
reason
of
its
central
position
it
is
also
their
mathematical
mean
since
it
is
equal
to
half
the
sum
of
every
opposing
pair
all
of
which
equal
fact
the
neat
balance
of
these
pairs
and
their
subtle
equilibrium
would
have
had
special
meaning
in
the
minds
of
the
they
considered
the
odd
numbers
as
male
and
the
even
ones
as
female
equating
the
two
groups
with
the
and
principles
in
and
in
this
square
the
respective
pairs
made
up
of
large
and
small
odd
numbers
and
those
composed
of
large
and
small
even
numbers
were
all
equal
to
each
other
all
differences
were
leveled
and
all
contrasts
erased
in
a
realm
of
no
distinction
and
the
harmonious
balance
of
the
square
could
effectively
symbolize
the
world
in
balanced
harmony
around
a
powerful
central
axis
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
in
the
square
for
purely
mathematical
reasons
and
the
fact
that
this
number
so
neatly
symbolized
the
heart
and
center
of
the
universe
could
well
explain
why
the
seem
to
have
so
revered
the
number
and
why
they
put
so
much
stress
on
the
concept
of
twin
tendencies
seem
to
have
reached
their
height
in
the
dynasty
existing
reverence
for
must
have
been
still
further
stimulated
toward
the
close
of
the
second
century
when
the
ordered
the
dynastic
color
changed
to
yellow
which
symbolized
the
among
the
traditional
and
took
as
the
dynastic
number
believing
that
he
would
thus
place
himself
his
imperial
family
and
the
nation
under
the
most
auspicious
influences
immediate
motive
for
doing
this
may
not
have
been
directly
inspired
by
the
but
this
measure
must
inevitably
have
increased
the
existing
beliefs
in
the
efficacy
this
time
inscriptions
on
the
bronze
mirrors
as
well
as
other
writings
emphasized
the
desirability
of
keeping
self
at
the
center
of
the
universe
where
cosmic
forces
were
strongest
we
shall
see
what
happened
when
an
emperor
took
this
idea
too
literally
this
emphasis
on
and
on
the
number
as
a
symbolic
expression
of
the
which
seems
to
have
begun
as
far
back
as
also
may
conceivably
have
led
to
the
development
of
the
and
the
subsequent
efforts
to
fit
everything
into
numerical
categories
of
five
find
for
example
such
groupings
as
the
the
the
with
the
and
many
others
trend
has
often
been
ascribed
to
the
cult
of
the
itself
as
though
they
had
served
as
the
base
for
all
the
rest
but
why
did
the
postulate
five
elements
when
the
which
may
have
initiated
the
idea
that
natural
elements
exerted
influence
in
human
life
and
activities
recognized
only
four
why
did
the
suddenly
begin
to
talk
about
the
when
the
animals
they
used
as
symbols
of
the
directions
designated
only
the
usual
four
something
suddenly
caused
them
to
start
thinking
in
terms
of
fives
and
that
may
have
been
the
workings
of
the
whole
tendency
had
an
unfortunate
effect
on
thinking
the
primary
meanings
of
the
diagram
seemed
to
have
been
based
on
its
inner
mathematical
properties
and
we
shall
see
that
even
its
secondary
meanings
rested
on
some
mathematical
bases
the
urgent
desire
to
place
everything
into
categories
of
fives
led
to
other
groupings
based
on
other
numbers
until
an
exaggerated
emphasis
on
mere
numerology
pervaded
thought
made
numbered
sets
of
as
many
things
as
possible
in
or
assigned
arbitrary
numbers
to
individual
things
in
a
fashion
that
seems
to
the
modern
scientific
mind
as
downright
nonsensical
and
philosophical
ideas
based
upon
all
this
tended
to
stifle
speculative
thought
in
for
many
centuries
and
in
the
square
the
primary
mathematical
properties
of
the
middle
number
at
the
center
of
the
and
the
interrelation
of
all
the
other
numbers
to
it
might
seem
enough
to
account
for
the
deep
fascination
which
the
held
for
the
philosophers
this
was
actually
only
a
beginning
of
wonders
the
square
was
a
remarkably
complete
compendium
of
most
of
the
chief
religious
and
philosophical
ideas
of
its
time
such
one
cannot
fully
understand
the
thought
of
the
and
periods
without
knowing
the
meanings
inherent
in
the
but
conversely
one
cannot
begin
to
understand
the
without
knowing
something
about
the
world
view
of
the
which
they
felt
they
saw
expressed
in
it
world
view
during
the
dynasty
when
the
seems
to
have
been
at
the
height
of
its
popularity
was
based
in
large
part
on
the
teachings
of
the
and
which
was
traditionally
founded
by
to
this
doctrine
the
universe
was
ruled
by
as
a
natural
force
or
in
the
personification
of
a
governing
all
things
by
means
of
a
process
called
the
which
can
be
roughly
interpreted
as
the
of
the
or
the
acting
through
the
expressed
itself
by
means
of
the
workings
of
two
basic
principles
the
and
the
or
male
principle
was
the
source
of
light
heat
and
dynamic
vitality
associated
with
the
while
the
or
female
principle
flourished
in
darkness
cold
and
quiet
inactivity
and
was
associated
with
the
these
two
principles
influenced
all
things
and
in
varying
combinations
they
were
present
in
everything
have
already
seen
that
odd
numbers
were
considered
as
being
while
the
even
numbers
were
so
that
the
eight
outer
numbers
of
the
represented
these
two
principles
in
balanced
equilibrium
around
the
axial
center
the
dynasty
another
conception
was
applied
to
the
considering
the
latter
as
a
plan
of
of
linking
the
nine
numbers
of
this
diagram
with
the
traditional
as
was
usually
done
this
equated
the
odd
numbers
with
mountains
firm
and
resistant
hence
and
the
even
numbers
with
rivers
sinuous
and
yielding
hence
taking
the
former
from
the
of
the
period
and
the
latter
from
the
principal
river
systems
of
the
middle
number
represented
in
the
in
the
in
the
in
or
the
mountain
with
the
same
name
in
neighboring
and
the
in
which
was
then
the
the
rivers
the
represented
the
to
the
then
the
the
three
rivers
in
the
then
the
the
in
the
and
the
the
upper
in
the
that
by
standards
this
plan
was
upside
down
as
it
put
at
the
bottom
and
at
the
top
with
the
other
directions
correspondingly
altered
but
in
this
respect
it
was
merely
following
the
accepted
convention
for
all
maps
same
arrangement
was
used
when
the
was
equated
with
the
and
whenever
the
involved
directional
symbolism
it
was
oriented
in
this
same
fashion
persons
who
join

are
insincere
earnestly
desire
to
do
the

of
they
fall
by
the
wayside

it

an
indictment
of
the
fatalities

dramatic
evidence
of
halfway

that

when

local

this
will

the

followed
the

of

and
carried
through
a

of

preparation
as
outlined
earlier
in
this

the

of
assimilation
and
growth
will
be
well
under

who
enter
the

of
the

intelligently
and
with
dedication
will
not
so
easily
step
through
the

because
of
lost
interest
it
is
not
enough
to
bring
persons
to
commitment
and
train
them
in
the

of

they
unite
with
the
they
must
find
in

neither

but
with
these
two
qualifications
the
statement

statement
also
points
to
a
classic
paradox
more
men
turn
toward
who
is
not
only
in
himself
the
paradigm
of
all
unity
but
also
the
only
ground
on
which
human
unity
can
ultimately
be
established
the
more
men
splinter
into
groups
and
set
themselves
apart
from
one
another
be
reminded
of
this
we
need
only
glance
at
the
world
map
and
note
the
extent
to
which
religious
divisions
have
compounded
political
ones
with
a
resultant
fragmentation
of
the
human
race
attending
the
partition
of
and
the
establishment
of
the
of
are
simply
recent
grim
evidences
of
the
hostility
such
divisions
can
engender
words
of
come
forcibly
to
mind
how
we
hate
one
another
for
the
love
of
source
of
this
paradox
is
not
difficult
to
identify
lies
in
institutions
require
structure
form
and
definition
and
these
in
turn
entail
differentiation
and
exclusion
completely
amorphous
institution
would
be
a
contradiction
in
terms
to
escape
this
fate
it
must
rule
some
things
out
every
criterion
which
defines
what
something
is
at
the
same
time
proclaims
implicitly
if
not
openly
what
that
something
is
not
persons
are
so
sensitive
to
this
truth
as
to
propose
that
we
do
away
with
institutions
altogether
in
the
present
context
this
amounts
to
the
advice
that
while
being
religious
may
have
a
certain
justification
we
ought
to
dispense
with
churches
suggestion
is
naive
is
at
once
a
gregarious
animal
and
a
being
once
committed
himself
to
an
ideal
which
he
considers
worthwhile
he
inevitably
creates
forms
for
its
expression
and
institutions
for
its
continuance
propose
that
men
be
religious
without
having
religious
institutions
is
like
proposing
that
they
be
learned
without
having
schools
eventualities
are
possible
logically
but
practically
they
are
impossible
much
as
men
intrinsically
need
the
unity
that
is
grounded
in
they
instrumentally
require
the
institutions
that
will
direct
their
steps
toward
him
the
fact
remains
that
such
institutions
do
set
men
at
odds
with
their
fellows
there
any
way
out
of
the
predicament
only
way
that
can
see
is
through
communication
communication
need
not
be
regarded
as
an
unfortunate
burden
visited
upon
us
by
the
necessity
of
maintaining
diplomatic
relations
with
our
adversaries
creatively
it
is
a
high
art
is
the
art
of
relating
the
finite
to
the
infinite
of
doing
our
best
to
insure
that
the
particularistic
requirements
of
religious
institutions
will
not
thwart
intent
of
unity
among
men
more
than
is
minimally
necessary
a
certain
sense
interfaith
communication
parallels
diplomatic
communication
among
the
are
the
pertinent
facts
affecting
such
communication
at
the
present
juncture
of
history
shall
touch
on
three
areas
personal
national
and
theological
personal
factors
mean
those
rooted
in
personality
structure
interfaith
tensions
are
not
occasioned
by
theological
differences
at
all
but
by
the
need
of
men
to
have
persons
they
can
blame
distrust
denounce
and
even
hate
needs
may
rise
to
pathological
proportions
psychology
has
shown
that
paralleling
the
authoritarian
personality
is
the
bigoted
personality
in
which
insecurity
inferiority
suspicion
and
distrust
combine
to
provide
a
target
for
antagonism
so
indispensable
that
it
will
be
manufactured
if
it
does
not
exist
naturally
the
number
of
pathological
bigots
appears
to
be
quite
small
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
that
more
than
a
matter
of
degree
separates
them
from
the
rest
of
us
some
extent
the
personal
inadequacies
that
prejudices
attempt
to
compensate
for
are
to
be
found
in
all
of
us
conflicts
which
spring
from
psychological
deficiencies
are
the
most
unfortunate
of
all
for
they
have
no
redeeming
features
whatsoever
is
difficult
to
say
what
can
be
done
about
them
except
that
we
must
learn
to
recognize
when
it
is
they
rather
than
pretexts
for
them
that
are
causing
the
trouble
and
do
everything
possible
to
nurture
the
healthy
personalities
that
will
prevent
the
development
of
such
deficiencies
the
personality
factors
that
aggravate
interfaith
conflict
may
be
perennial
nationalism
is
more
variable
specific
instance
have
in
mind
is
the
version
which
has
gained
prominence
only
in
this
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
from
the
two
centuries
of
colonial
domination
the
world
is
aflame
with
a
nationalism
that
has
undone
empires
less
than
nations
have
already
achieved
independence
since
and
the
number
is
growing
by
the
year
an
obvious
consequence
obstacles
to
genuine
interfaith
communication
have
grown
more
formidable
in
one
important
area
relations
between
and
in
these
lands
alone
would
have
been
able
to
make
these
difficulties
serious
for
is
so
closely
tied
to
colonialism
in
the
minds
of
these
people
that
repudiation
of
the
one
has
tended
automatically
toward
the
repudiation
of
the
other
however
this
turns
out
to
be
only
part
of
the
picture
has
abetted
not
only
the
repudiation
of
foreign
religions
but
the
revival
of
native
ones
some
of
which
had
been
lying
in
slumber
for
centuries
truth
is
that
any
revival
of
traditional
and
indigenous
religion
will
serve
to
promote
that
sense
of
identity
and
which
these
young
nations
very
much
need
as
these
nations
claim
to
incarnate
traditions
and
ways
of
life
which
constitute
ultimate
justifications
for
their
existence
such
people
are
inevitably
led
to
emphasize
the
ways
in
which
these
traditions
and
ways
are
theirs
rather
than
someone
this
works
severely
against
the
kind
of
communication
for
which
missions
stand
and
tend
to
consider
not
only
missions
but
the
local
churches
they
have
produced
as
centers
and
agents
of
culture
and
ideology
if
not

propaganda

conversation

three
years
ago
while
flying
from
to

seated
next
to
the
director
of
the
world
radio
program
said
that
on
his
tour
the
preceding
year
a
considerable
number
of
hours
would
have
been
available
to
him
on
radio
networks
but
that
he
had
then
lacked
the
funds
to

for
them

to

raising

discovered
on
getting
back
to
that
the
hours
were
no
longer
available
was
not
that
they
had
been
contracted
for
during
the
interval
they
simply
could
no
longer
be
purchased
for
missionary
purposes
is
not
unfair
to
add
on
the
other
side
that
the
crude
and
almost
vitriolic
approach
of
certain
fundamentalist
sects
toward
the
cultures
and
religions
among
which
they
work
has
contributed
measurably
to
this
heightening
of
sentiment
these
are
the
groups
which
have
doubled
or
tripled
their
missionary
efforts
since
while
the
more
established
denominations
are
barely
maintaining
staffs
have
emphasized
the
barriers
which
an
aroused
nationalism
has
raised
against
relations
between

in
the
fact
is
that
this
development
has
also
widened
the
gulf
between
certain
religions

several
theological
developments
reconsidered
modern
world
has
been
marked
by
progressive
disaffection
with
claims
to
divine
sanction
for
the
state
whatever
its
political
form
was
historic
at
this
point
in
providing
that
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
of
our
foremost
jurists
has
gone
so
far
as
to
call
this
provision
the
greatest
achievement
ever
made
in
the
course
of
human
history
trend
throughout
the

been
toward
a
recognition
of
at

the
practical
validity
of
this
constitutional
enactment

created
in
expressly
as
a
state
but
when
the
army
took
over
eleven
years
later
it
did
so
on
a
wave
of
mass
impatience
which
was
directed
in
part
against
the
inability
of
political
and
religious
leaders
to
think
their
way
through
to
the
meaning
of
for
the
modern
political
situation
is
the
point
reports
the
as
asking
in
demanding
an
state
and
society
if
no
one
not
even
the
doctors
of

themselves
can
say
clearly
and
succinctly
what
the

experienced
a
great
loss
of
prestige

recent
months

years
when
was
passing
from

to
crisis

campaign
the
infusion
of
multitudes
of
penniless
immigrants
it
was
felt
that
the
purpose
of
national
unity
could
be
best
served
if
the
secular
majority
were
to
yield
to
the
religious
parties
that

relative
prosperity
and
a
reduction
of

the
secularists

less
disposed
to
compromise
in
this
country
delineation
of
the
line
between
the
sacral
and
secular
orders
during
the
last
presidential
campaign
served
to
provide
a
most
impressive
defense
of
the
practical
autonomy
of
both
church
and
state
failure
at
that
time
of
the
bishops
to
control
the
votes
of
their
people
added
a
ring
of
good
sense
to
theological
argument
there
seems
to
be
a
growing
recognition
of
the
fact
that
governments
and
religious
institutions
alike
are
too
fallible
and
corruptible
in
a
word
too
human
to
warrant
any
claim
of
maintaining
partnership
with
the
divine
reconsidered
father

as
a
missionary
to
in
a
generation
that
responded
to
speakers
who
held
watches
in
their
hands
and
announced
to
the
students
in
their
audiences
how
many
souls
were
going
to
hell
each
second
because
these
students
were
not
over
there
saving
them
mention
of
this
should
bring
smiles
to
our
lips
today
is
as
clear
an
indication
as
we
could
wish
of
the
extent
to
which
attitudes
have
changed
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
have
adopted
the
liberal
assumption
so

of
considerable
significance

that
there

mentioning
this

reconsidered
do
not
mean
to
imply
that
doctrine
has
changed
in
this
area
but
rather
that
it
has
become
clearer
to
the
world
community
what
that
doctrine
is
they
say
that
under
no
circumstances
would
it
ever
be
right
to
permit
the
termination
of
the
human
race
by
human
action
because
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
proportionate
grave
reason
to
justify
such
a
thing
they
know
exactly
what
they
mean
course
in
prudential
calculation
in
balancing
the
good
directly
intended
and
done
against
the
evil
unintended
and
indirectly
done
no
greater
precision
can
be
forthcoming
than
the
subject
allows
it
seems
clear
that
there
can
be
no
good
sufficiently
great
or
evil
repelled
sufficiently
grave
to
warrant
the
destruction
of
mankind
by
own
action
mean
however
that
the
moral
theologian
knows
what
he
means
by
permit
is
not
talking
in
the
main
about
probabilities
risks
and
danger
in
general
is
talking
about
an
action
which
just
as
efficaciously
does
an
evil
thing
and
is
known
certainly
and
unavoidably
to
lead
to
this
evil
result
as
it
efficaciously
does
some
good
is
talking
about
double
effects
of
which
the
specific
action
causes
directly
the
one
and
indirectly
the
other
but
causes
both
of
which
one
is
deliberately
willed
or
intended
and
the
other
not
intended
or
not
directly
intended
but
still
both
are
done
while
the
evil
effect
is
with
equal
consciousness
on
the
part
of
the
agent
foreknown
to
be
among
the
consequences
is
what
in
a
technical
sense
to
only
permit
an
evil
result
means
means
to
do
it
and
to
know
one
is
doing
it
but
as
only
a
secondary
if
certain
effect
of
the
good
one
primarily
does
and
intends
course
grave
guiltiness
may
be
imputed
to
the
military
action
of
any
nation
or
to
the
action
of
any
leader
or
leaders
which
for
any
supposed
good
permits
in
this
sense
the
termination
of
the
human
race
by
human
action
in
analyzing
an
action
which
truly
faced
such
alternatives
it
is
never
possible
that
no
world
would
be
preferable
to
some
worlds
and
there
are
in
truth
no
circumstances
in
which
the
destruction
of
human
life
presents
itself
as
a
reasonable
alternative
where
one
or
the
other
of
the
effects
of
an
action
is
uncertain
this
has
to
be
taken
into
account
is
this
true
when
because
the
good
effect
is
remote
and
speculative
while
the
evil
is
certain
and
grave
the
action
is
prohibited
if
the
reverse
is
the
case
and
the
good
effect
is
more
certain
than
the
evil
result
that
may
be
forthcoming
not
only
must
the
good
and
the
evil
be
prudentially
weighed
and
found
proportionate
but
also
calculation
of
the
probabilities
and
of
the
degree
of
certainty
or
uncertainty
in
the
good
or
evil
effect
must
be
taken
into
account
must
not
only
be
greater
good
than
evil
objectively
in
view
but
also
greater
probability
of
actually
doing
more
good
than
harm
an
evil
which
is
certain
and
extensive
and
immediate
may
rarely
be
compensated
for
by
a
problematic
speculative
future
good
by
the
same
token
not
every
present
certain
and
immediate
good
or
lesser
evil
that
may
have
to
be
done
will
be
outweighed
by
a
problematic
speculative
and
future
evil
according
to
the
traditional
theory
a
man
begins
in
the
midst
of
action
and
he
analyzes
its
nature
and
immediate
consequences
before
or
while
putting
it
forth
and
causing
these
consequences
does
not
expect
to
be
able
to
trammel
up
all
the
future
consequences
of
his
action
all
he
does
not
debate
mere
contingencies
and
therefore
if
these
are
possibly
dreadful
find
himself
forced
into
inaction
does
what
he
can
and
may
and
must
without
regarding
himself
as
lord
of
the
future
or
on
the
other
hand
as
covered
with
guilt
by
accident
or
unforeseen
consequences
or
by
results
he
did
not
permit
in
the
sense
explained
contrast
a
good
deal
of
nuclear
pacifism
begins
with
the
contingencies
and
the
probabilities
and
not
with
the
moral
nature
of
the
action
to
be
done
and
by
deriving
legitimate
decision
backward
from
whatever
may
conceivably
or
possibly
or
probably
result
whether
by
doing
or
by
accident
it
finds
itself
driven
to
inaction
to
action
in
politics
and
action
in
military
affairs
and
to
the
not
very
surprising
discovery
that
there
are
now
no
distinctions
on
which
the
defense
of
justice
can
possibly
be
based
writes
for
example
that
in
terms
of
probability
it
is
surely
as
likely
as
not
that
mutual
fear
will
lead
to
accidental
war
in
the
near
future
if
the
present
situation
continues
it
continues
indefinitely
it
is
nearly
a
statistical
certainty
that
a
mistake
will
be
made
and
that
the
devastation
will
begin
such
a
termination
of
human
life
on
earth
by
human
action
he
then
proposes
as
an
alternative
that
we
negotiate
at
once
with
the
and
get
the
best
terms
which
are
available
that
we
deliberately
negotiate
from
comparative
weakness
bravely
attempts
to
face
this
alternative
realistically
by
considering
the
worst
possible
outcome
namely
the
total
domination
of
the
world
by
within
a
few
years
would
be
by
far
the
better
choice
when
it
is
a
question
of
allowing
the
human
race
to
survive
possibly
under
the
domination
of
a
regime
which
most
of
us
detest
or
of
allowing
it
to
destroy
itself
in
appalling
and
prolonged
anguish
the
consequence
of
the
policy
proposed
is
everywhere
subtly
qualified
it
is
a
possible
result
however
improbable
the
worst
and
least
probable
result
if
it
prevail
mankind
would
still
be
given
the
opportunity
of
prevailing
for
surely
anything
is
better
than
a
policy
which
allows
for
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
we
have
not
thought
and
made
a
decision
entirely
in
these
terms
then
we
need
to
submit
ourselves
to
the
following
simple
test
we
decided
how
we
are
to
kill
the
other
members
of
our
household
in
the
event
of
our
being
less
injured
than
they
are
moral
decision
must
be
entirely
deduced
backward
from
the
likely
eventuality
it
is
no
longer
to
be
formulated
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
present
action
itself
its
intention
and
proximate
effect
or
the
thing
to
be
done
of
the
replies
to
without
conscious
resort
to
the
traditional
terminology
with
regard
to
the
permission
of
evil
succeed
in
restoring
the
actual
context
in
which
present
moral
and
political
decisions
must
be
made
by
distinguishing
between
choosing
a
great
evil
and
choosing
in
danger
of
this
evil
is
worse
for
a
nation
to
give
in
to
evil
than
to
run
the
risk
of
annihilation
am
consciously
prepared
to
run
the
continued
risk
of
race
suicide
by
accident
rather
than
accept
the
alternative
certainty
of
race
slavery
by
design
can
only
make
this
choice
because
believe
that
the
risk
need
not
increase
but
may
be
deliberately
reduced
by
precautions
against
accidents
or
by
limiting
war
phrase
that
anything
would
be
better
than
a
policy
which
led
inevitably
to
nuclear
war
he
says
that
anything
is
better
than
a
policy
which
allows
for
the
possibility
of
nuclear
war
asked
to
choose
between
a
terrible
probability
and
a
more
terrible
possibility
most
men
will
choose
the
latter
is
claiming
that
the
choice
lies
between
capitulation
and
the
risk
of
nuclear
war
think
he
is
right
do
not
accept
that
the
choice
is
between
capitulation
and
the
certainty
of
nuclear
war
agreeing
with
his
son
does
so
in
these
terms
to
continuing
to
incur
a
constant
risk
of
the
destruction
of
the
human
race
all
other
evils
are
lesser
evils
us
therefore
put
first
things
first
and
make
sure
of
preserving
the
human
race
at
whatever
the
temporary
price
may
be

at
one
point
that
if
he
shared
the
anticipations
of
in
if
he
believed
was
not
only
evil
but
also
irredeemably
evil
then
he
might
think
it
right
to
do
anything
rather
than
to
take
the
risk
of
a
communist
world
a
nuclear
holocaust
is
a
little
less
frightful
to
contemplate
than
a
race
of
dehumanised
humans
occupying
the
earth
until
doomsday
political
order
or
economic
system
is
so
clearly
contrary
to
nature
one
does
not
have
to
affirm
the
existence
of
an
evil
order
irredeemable
in
that
sense
or
a
static
order
in
which
no
changes
will
take
place
in
time
to
be
able
truthfully
to
affirm
the
following
fact
there
has
never
been
justitia
imprinted
in
social
institutions
and
social
relationships
except
in
the
context
of
some
preserved
by
clothed
or
naked
force
their
way
to
the
the
children
of
make
use
of
the
of
the
earthly
city
and
acknowledge
their
share
in
responsibility
for
its
preservation
to
repel
injury
and
uphold
and
improve
means
not
simply
to
accept
the
misshapen
order
and
injustice
that
challenges
it
at
the
moment
but
also
to
start
down
the
steep
slope
along
which
justice
can
find
no
place
whereon
to
stand
seems
to
think
that
there
is
some
other
way
to
give
justice
social
embodiment
would
far
rather
die
after
a
occupation
of
this
country
by
some
deliberate
act
of
refusal
than
die
uselessly
by
atomisation
such
an
act
of
refusal
be
useful
does
not
mean
in
fact
he
addresses
himself
specifically
to
reject
the
proposition
that
if
we
took
the
risk
of
surrendering
a
new
generation
in
would
soon
begin
to
amass
its
strength
in
secret
in
order
to
reverse
the
consequences
of
that
surrender
wants
to
be
brutally
frank
and
say
that
these
rebellions
would
be
hopeless
far
far
more
hopeless
than
was
the
revolution
of
is
not
a
project
for
regaining
the
ground
for
limited
war
by
creating
a
monopoly
in
one
power
of
the
arsenal
of
unlimited
weapons
is
a
proposal
that
justice
now
be
served
by
means
other
than
those
that
have
ever
preconditioned
the
search
for
it
or
preconditioned
more
positive
means
for
attaining
it
in
the
past
is
no
good
recommending
surrender
rather
than
nuclear
warfare
with
the
proviso
that
surrender
could
be
followed
by
the
effective
military
resistance
by
occupied
peoples
for
the
future
would
lie
in
the
natural
longing
of
the
human
race
for
freedom
and
the
right
to
develop
is
to
surrender
in
advance
to
whatever
attack
may
yet
be
mounted
to
the
very
last
it
is
to
stride
along
the
steep
slope
downward
only
contrary
action
in
the
future
as
in
the
past
runs
the
risk
of
war
and
now
and
in
the
future
unlike
in
the
past
any
attempt
to
repel
injury
and
to
preserve
any
particular
civilized
attainment
of
mankind
or
its
provisional
justice
runs
some
risk
of
nuclear
warfare
and
the
danger
that
an
effect
of
it
will
by
human
action
render
this
planet
less
habitable
by
the
human
race
is
why
it
is
so
very
important
that
ethical
analysis
keep
clear
the
problem
of
decision
as
to
permitted
effects
and
not
draw
back
in
fright
from
any
conceivable
contingency
or
suffer
paralysis
of
action
before
possibilities
or
probabilities
unrelated
or
not
directly
morally
related
to
what
we
can
and
may
and
must
do
as
long
as
human
history
endures
just
as
no
different
issues
are
posed
for
thoughtful
analysis
by
the
foreshortening
of
time
that
may
yet
pass
before
the
end
of
human
life
on
this
earth
but
only
stimulation
and
alarm
to
the
imagination
the
same
thing
must
be
said
in
connection
with
the
question
of
what
we
may
perhaps
already
be
doing
by
human
action
to
accelerate
this
end
should
not
allow
the
image
of
an
immanent
end
brought
about
indirectly
by
our
own
action
in
the
continuing
human
struggle
for
a
just
endurable
order
of
existence
to
blind
us
to
the
fact
that
in
some
measure
accelerating
the
end
of
our
lease
may
be
one
consequence
among
others
of
many
other
of
thrusts

not

not

that
as

for
real

interests
the
of
and
its
local
associations
have
sought
to
limit
and
often
ignore
much
of
this
pressure

the
local
realtor
see
himself
in
the

attachment
does
he

a
group
of
the
faculty
at
sought
some
answers
to
these
questions
realtors
were
invited
to
participate
in
a
small
colloquium
of
property
lawyers
political
scientists
economists
social
psychologists
social
ethicists
and
theologians
in
an
atmosphere
of
forthrightness
and
mutual
criticism
each
sought
to
bring
his
particular
insights
to

upon
the
question
of
discrimination
in

and
the
part
each
man
present
played
in
it
a
number
of
years
has
been
drawing
varied
groups
of
political
and
business
leaders
into
these
informal
discussions
with
members
of
the
faculty
and
student
body
attempting
to
explore
and
clarify
aspects
of
their
responsibility
for
public
policy
article
presents
our
observations
of
that
session
of
the
realtors
as
they
saw
themselves
and
as
the
faculty
and
students
saw
them
conversation
quickly
reveals
an
ethically
significant
ambivalence
in
the
held
by
most
realtors
the
membership
of
this
group
as
has
been
found
true
of
men
in
other
professional
or
trade
associations
the
most
ready
portrayal
of
oneself
to
the
public
is
that
of
a
neutral
agent
simply
serving
the
interests
of
a
seller
or
buyer
and
mediating
between
them
responsibility
is
seen
to
consist
largely
in
serving
the
wishes
of
the
client
fairly
and
in
an
efficient
manner
as
conversation
goes
on
particularly
among
the
realtors
themselves
another
image
emerges
that
of
considerable
power
and
influence
in
the
community
much
more
than
customer
expectation
is
determining
the
role
are
continually
rendered
regarding
the
potential
income
educational
level
and
above
all
racial
extraction
and
whether
these
would
qualify
them
for
congenial
happy
relations
to
other
people
in
certain
community
areas
narrow
professionalism
explicit
such
factors
have
been
historically
is
evident
in
any
chronology
of
restrictive
covenant
cases
or
in
a
review
of
of
in
the
adopted
in
states
that
a
should
never
be
instrumental
in
introducing
into
a
neighborhood
a
character
of
property
or
occupancy
members
of
any
race
or
nationality
or
any
individuals
whose
presence
will
clearly
be
detrimental
to
property
values
in
that
neighborhood
the
reference
to
race
was
stricken
by
the
association
in
being
an
agent
of
such
detrimental
influences
still
appears
as
the
cardinal
sin
realtors
see
themselves
committed
to
avoid
rationale
for
this
avoidance
was
most
frequently
expressed
in
economic
terms
all
feared
the
supposed
stigma
they
believed
would
inevitably
attach
to
any
realtor
who
openly
introduced
particularly
peoples
into
restricted
areas
would
become
tagged
as
men
not
interested
in
being
purely
real
estate
professionals
but
agitators
for
some
kind
of
cause
or
reform
and
this
was
no
longer
to
be
a
pro
what
we
are
confronted
with
here
is
the
identification
of
professional
with
narrow
skills
and
specialization
the
effective
servicing
of
a
client
rather
than
responsiveness
to
the
wider
and
deeper
meaning
and
associations
of
work
men
for
the
most
part
educated
in
our
best
colleges
well
established
financially
and
socially
in
the
community
under
kindly
but
insistent
probing
reveal
little
or
no
objective
or
explicit
criteria
or
data
for
their
generalizations
about
the
interests
and
attitudes
of
the
people
they
claim
to
serve
or
about
the
public
responses
that
actually
follow
their
occasional
breach
of
a
relationship
narrow
professionalism
does
not
even
fit
the
present
realities
of
their
situation
as
the
pressure
of
minorities
and
the
power
and
respectability
of
the
realtors
increase
our
discussion
continued
the
inadequacy
of
the
client
relationship
as
an
interpretation
of
their
way
of
operating
became
evident
live
in
their
communities
as
specialists
in
a
given
area
of
work
as
members
of
social
and
professional
organizations
as
citizens
and
civic
leaders
as
church
laymen
as
university
alumni
as
newspaper
readers
such
communal
roles
the
realtor
finds
the
substance
that
shapes
his
moral
understanding
seems
to
us
that
choices
exercised
by
realtors
in
moral
situations
center
in
at
least
three
areas
the
various
ways
in
which
they
interpret
a
particular
social
issue
their
pattern
of
involvement
in
the
regular
legal
and
political
processes
and
most
pervasively
their
interpretation
of
who
is
a
real
pro
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
professional
man
in
a
technical
fragmented
society
of
the
realtors
minimized
their
own
understanding
of
and
role
in
the
racial
issue
pleading
that
they
only
reflect
the
attitudes
and
intentions
of
their
society
is
some
reality
to
this
the
on
and
concluded
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
real
estate
men
are
either
more
or
less
racially
prejudiced
on
the
whole
than
any
other
segment
of
the
population
such
a
reaction
obscures
the
powerful
efforts
made
in
the
past
by
both
and
its
local
boards
for
the
maintenance
of
restrictive
clauses
and
practices
it
does
not
recognize
the
elements
of
choice
and
judgment
continually
employed
business
and
university
groups
generally
these
men
had
very
limited
knowledge
of
recent
sociological
and
psychological
studies
and
findings
that
might
illumine
the
decisions
they
make
both
generally
and
in
this
group
have
invariably
equated
residential
integration
with
a
decline
in
property
values
a
circumstance
viewed
with
considerable
apprehension
studies
by
the
on
and
and
others
however
point
to
a
vast
complex
of
factors
that
often
do
not
warrant
this
conclusion
are
increasing
numbers
of
neighborhoods
that
are
integrated
residentially
without
great
loss
of
property
values
the
white
population
having
taken
the
initiative
in
preparing
the
areas
for
an
appreciation
of
the
desire
for
housing
privacy
on
the
decline
of
property
values
in
an
area
after
a
new
racial
group
enters
it
has
to
be
assessed
in
terms
of
the
trends
in
property
values
before
the
group
comes
in
they
are
able
to
get
in
only
because
the
area
is
declining
economically
no
realtor
and
few
of
the
faculty
present
were
familiar
with
any
of
the
six
volumes
published
by
the
of
that
present
the
findings
one
anticipates
any
radical
shift
in
this
situation
but
questions
concerning
reading
habits
the
availability
of
such
data
and
the
places
where
it
is
discussed
must
surely
be
raised
role
of
both

and

sources
of

of

beyond

housing
necessarily
involves
such
basic
issues
as
the
intensity
of
democratic
conviction
and
religious
belief
concerning
equality
of
opportunity
the
function
and
limitations
of

in
the
securing
of

grain
of

of
course
that
they
are
involved
in
an
increasingly
complex
legal
and
political
system
that
is
opening
up
opportunities
for
leverage
on
their
relation
to
clients
as
well
as
opportunities
for
evasion
of
their
responsibility
for

discrimination
in

the
positive
side

action
has
largely
undermined
the
legal
sanction
so
long
enjoyed
by
the
segregationist
position
statutes

now
been
adopted
by
thirteen
states

setting
standards
of

that
they

in

none

been
willing
to
go

of
omission
as
well
as
commission
the
attitude
adopted
by
realtors
and
their
associations
either
negative
or
positive
plays
a
large
part
in
the
public
acceptance
of
such
measures
and
the
degree
to
which
they
may
be
effectively
enforced
opinion
since
the
decision
on
has
rendered
racial
restrictive
covenants
unenforcible
a
decision
should
have
placed
a
powerful
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
entire
housing
industry
but
there
is
little
evidence
that
realtors
or
at
least
their
associations
have
repudiated
the
principle
in
such
clauses
the
states
that
have
passed
laws
preventing
discrimination
in
the
sale
or
rental
of
housing
support
by
real
estate
associations
for
compliance
and
broadened
coverage
through
additional
legislation
could
help
remove
the
label
of
social
reformism
that
most
realtors
individually
seem
determined
to
avoid
as
yet
no
real
estate
board
has
been
willing
officially
to
support
such
laws
or
to
admit
the
permissibility
of
introducing
minority
buyers
into
neighborhoods
of
the
roles
of
the
social
scientist
ethicist
or
theologian
in
our
discussions
with
the
realtors
became
that
of
encouraging
greater
awareness
of
the
opportunities
offered
by
the
legal
and
political
processes
for
the
exercise
of
broad
social
responsibilities
in
their
work
responsiveness
to
these
opportunities
presumes
that
all
of
us
judge
the
good
as
a
human
good
and
not
simply
as
a
professional
white
good
judgments
are
meaningful
only
in
so
far
as
persons
are
members
of
a
world
let
us
say
a
community
that
embraces
or
but
is
also
infinitely
richer
since
it
is
community
of
all
creation
is
then
the
ultimate
object
of
our
loyalty
and
the
concrete
norm
of
all
moral
judgment
discrimination
is
wrong
then
not
because
it
goes
against
the
grain
of
a
faculty
member
trying
to
converse
with
a
few
realtors
but
because
it
goes
against
the
grain
of
creation
and
against
the
will
of
the
moral
issues
concerning
the
nature
of
the
legal
and
political
processes
take
on
theological
dimensions
fragmented
the
years
individuals
engaged
in
the
sale
of
real
estate
have
developed
remarkable
unity
in
the
methods
and
practices
employed
realtors
and
real
estate
brokers
talk
of
themselves
as
professional
people
with
the
cultural
and
moral
values
held
by
the
traditional
professions
what
significance
attaches
to
professional
beyond
the
narrow
sense
of
skillfulness
in
meeting
a
stated
needs
as
already
noted
faculty
and
students
pressed
this
issue
more
than
any
other
a
theologian
in
the
group
pointed
out
a
professional
was
before
the
modern
period
of
technical
specialization
one
who
professed
to
be
a
bearer
and
critic
of
his
culture
in
the
use
of
his
particular
skills
we
look
about
the
world
today
we
can
see
clearly
that
there
are
two
especially
significant
factors
shaping
the
future
of
our
civilization
science
and
religion
is
placing
in
our
hands
the
ultimate
power
of
the
universe
the
power
of
the
atom
or
the
lack
of
it
will
decide
whether
we
use
this
power
to
build
a
brave
new
world
of
peace
and
abundance
for
all
mankind
or
whether
we
misuse
this
power
to
leave
a
world
utterly
destroyed
can
we
have
the
wisdom
to
meet
such
a
new
and
difficult
challenge
may
feel
pessimistic
at
the
outlook
yet
there
is
a
note
of
hope
because
this
same
science
that
is
giving
us
the
power
of
the
atom
is
also
giving
us
atomic
vision
are
looking
inside
the
atom
and
seeing
there
a
universe
which
is
not
material
but
something
beyond
the
material
a
universe
that
in
a
word
is
not
matter
but
music
it
is
in
this
new
vision
of
the
atom
that
we
find
an
affirmation
and
an
invigoration
of
our
faith
energy
see
this
vision
in
perspective
we
need
first
of
all
a
clear
idea
of
the
magnitude
of
this
new
power
from
the
atom
know
that
could
hold
right
here
in
my
hand
the
little
chunk
of
uranium
metal
that
was
the
heart
of
the
bomb
that
dropped
on
was
only
about
the
size
of
a
baseball
but
packed
in
that
metallic
ball
there
was
the
explosive
force
of
tons
of
is
enough
to
fill
the
tower
of
the
and
with
the
availability
of
bombs
of
that
size
war
became
a
new
problem
we
might
have
restricted
the
use
of
uranium
bombs
by
controlling
the
sources
of
uranium
because
it
is
found
in
only
a
few
places
in
the
world
we
had
hardly
started
to
adjust
our
thinking
to
this
new
uranium
weapon
when
we
were
faced
with
the
hydrogen
bomb
is
just
as
plentiful
as
uranium
is
scarce
know
that
we
have
hydrogen
in
water
water
is
and
the
stands
for
hydrogen
there
is
also
hydrogen
in
wood
and
hydrogen
in
our
bodies
have
calculated
that
if
could
snap
my
fingers
in
one
magic
gesture
to
release
the
power
of
all
the
hydrogen
in
my
body
would
explode
with
the
force
of
a
hundred
bombs
of
the
kind
that
fell
on
try
the
experiment
but
think
you
can
see
that
if
we
all
knew
the
secret
and
we
could
all
let
ourselves
go
there
would
be
quite
an
explosion
then
think
how
little
hydrogen
we
have
in
us
compared
with
the
hydrogen
in
or
in
the
ocean
beyond
water
is
still
the
same
hydrogen
is
there
the
size
of
the
ocean
shows
us
the
magnitude
of
the
destructive
power
we
hold
in
our
hands
today
course
there
is
also
an
optimistic
side
to
the
picture
if
knew
the
secret
of
letting
this
power
in
my
body
change
directly
into
electricity
could
rent
myself
out
to
the
electric
companies
and
with
just
the
power
in
my
body
could
light
all
the
lights
and
run
all
the
factories
in
the
entire
for
some
days
think
if
we
all
knew
this
secret
and
we
could
pool
our
power
what
a
wonderful
public
utility
company
we
would
make
just
the
hydrogen
of
our
bodies
we
could
run
the
world
for
years
think
of
and
the
ocean
and
you
see
that
we
have
a
supply
of
power
for
millions
of
years
to
come
is
power
with
which
we
can
literally
rebuild
the
world
provide
adequate
housing
food
education
abundant
living
for
everyone
everywhere
octillion
atoms
let
us
see
where
this
power
comes
from
grasp
our
new
view
of
the
atom
we
have
to
appreciate
first
of
all
how
small
the
atom
is
have
been
trying
to
make
this
clear
to
my
own
class
in
chemistry
night
there
were
some
dried
peas
lying
on
our
kitchen
table
and
these
peas
looked
to
me
like
a
little
group
of
atoms
and
asked
myself
a
question
had
the
same
number
of
peas
as
there
are
atoms
in
my
body
how
large
an
area
would
they
cover
calculated
first
that
there
are
about
an
octillion
atoms
in
the
average
human
body
that
is
a
figure
one
with
ciphers
quite
a
large
number
calculated
that
a
million
peas
would
just
about
fill
a
household
refrigerator
a
billion
peas
would
fill
a
small
house
from
cellar
to
attic
a
trillion
peas
would
fill
all
the
houses
in
a
town
of
about
ten
thousand
people
and
a
quadrillion
peas
would
fill
all
the
buildings
in
the
city
of
saw
that
would
soon
run
out
of
buildings
at
this
rate
so
decided
to
take
another
measure
the
whole
state
of
that
there
is
a
blizzard
over
but
instead
of
snowing
snow
it
snows
peas
so
we
get
the
whole
state
covered
with
peas
about
four
feet
deep
can
imagine
what
it
would
look
like
going
out
on
the
turnpike
with
the
peas
banked
up
against
the
houses
and
covering
the
cars
thus
blanketed
would
contain
about
a
quintillion
peas
we
still
have
a
long
way
to
go
we
imagine
our
blizzard
raging
over
all
the
land
areas
of
the
entire
globe
and
all
covered
with
peas
four
feet
deep
then
we
have
sextillion
peas
we
freeze
over
the
oceans
and
cover
the
whole
earth
with
peas
then
we
go
out
among
the
neighboring
stars
collect
planets
each
the
size
of
the
earth
and
also
cover
each
of
these
with
peas
four
feet
deep
and
then
we
have
septillion
we
go
into
the
farthest
reaches
of
the
we
get
planets
we
cover
each
of
these
with
our
blanket
of
peas
and
then
at
last
we
have
octillion
peas
corresponding
in
number
to
the
atoms
in
the
body
you
see
how
small
an
atom
is
and
how
complicated
you
are
speck
and
space
although
an
atom
is
small
we
can
still
in
imagination
have
a
look
at
it
us
focus
on
an
atom
of
calcium
from
the
tip
of
the
bone
of
my
finger
and
let
us
suppose
that
swallow
a
magic
growing
pill
start
growing
rapidly
and
this
calcium
atom
grows
along
with
me
shoot
up
through
the
roof
into
the
sky
past
the
clouds
through
the
stratosphere
out
beyond
the
moon
out
among
the
planets
until
am
over
a
hundred
and
fifty
million
miles
long
this
atom
of
calcium
will
swell
to
something
like
a
great
balloon
a
hundred
yards
across
a
balloon
big
enough
to
put
a
football
field
inside
if
you
should
step
inside
of
such
a
magnified
atom
according
to
the
physics
of
forty
years
ago
you
would
see
circulating
over
your
head
down
at
the
sides
and
under
your
feet
some
twenty
luminous
balls
about
the
size
of
footballs
balls
are
moving
in
great
circles
and
ellipses
and
are
of
course
the
electrons
the
particles
of
negative
electricity
which
by
their
action
create
the
forces
that
tie
this
atom
of
calcium
to
the
neighboring
atoms
of
oxygen
and
make
up
the
solid
structure
of
my
finger
bone
these
electrons
are
moving
like
planets
you
may
wonder
whether
there
is
an
atomic
sun
at
the
center
of
the
atom
you
look
down
there
and
you
see
a
tiny
whirling
point
about
the
size
of
the
head
of
a
pin
is
the
atomic
sun
the
atomic
nucleus
if
the
atom
were
big
enough
to
hold
a
football
field
this
nucleus
is
still
only
about
the
size
of
a
pinhead
is
this
atomic
nucleus
that
contains
the
positive
charge
of
electricity
holding
these
negatively
charged
electrons
in
their
orbits
it
also
contains
nearly
all
the
mass
and
the
atomic
energy
may
ask
what
else
there
is
and
the
answer
is
nothing
nothing
but
empty
space
since
you
are
made
of
atoms
you
are
nothing
much
but
empty
space
too
could
put
your
body
in
an
imaginary
atomic
press
and
squeeze
you
down
squeeze
these
holes
out
of
you
in
the
way
we
squeeze
the
holes
out
of
a
sponge
you
would
get
smaller
and
smaller
until
finally
when
the
last
hole
was
gone
you
would
be
smaller
than
the
smallest
speck
of
dust
that
you
could
see
on
this
piece
of
paper
has
remarked
that
this
is
certainly
the
ultimate
in
reducing
any
rate
it
shows
us
how
immaterial
we
are
of
the
spheres
this
view
of
the
atom
was
on
the
whole
a
discouraging
picture
we
believed
that
the
electrons
obeyed
the
law
of
mechanics
and
electrodynamics
and
therefore
the
atom
was
really
just
a
little
machine
and
in
mechanics
the
whole
is
no
more
than
the
sum
of
the
parts
if
you
are
made
of
atoms
you
are
just
a
big
machine
and
since
the
universe
is
also
made
of
atoms
it
is
just
a
supermachine
this
would
mean
that
we
live
in
a
mechanistic
universe
governed
by
the
laws
of
cause
and
effect
bound
in
chains
of
determinism
that
hold
the
universe
on
a
completely
predetermined
course
in
which
there
is
not
room
for
soul
or
spirit
or
human
freedom
this
is
why
so
many
scientists
a
half
a
century
ago
were
agnostics
or
atheists
came
the
scientific
revolution
in
the
late
suggestion
from
a
physicist
in
showed
us
that
these
electrons
are
not
point
particles
but
waves
to
see
the
meaning
of
this
new
picture
imagine
that
you
can
put
on
more
powerful
glasses
and
go
back
inside
the
atom
and
have
a
look
at
it
in
the
way
we
view
it
today
as
you
step
inside
instead
of
seeing
particles
orbiting
around
like
planets
you
see
waves
and
ripples
very
much
like
the
ripples
that
you
get
on
the
surface
of
a
pond
when
you
drop
a
stone
into
it
ripples
spread
out
in
symmetrical
patterns
like
the
rose
windows
of
a
great
cathedral
as
the
waves
flow
back
and
forth
and
merge
with
the
waves
from
the
neighboring
atoms
you
can
put
on
a
magic
hearing
aid
and
you
hear
music
is
a
music
like
the
music
from
a
great
organ
or
a
vast
orchestra
playing
a
symphony
melody
counterpoint
symphonic
structure
are
there
and
as
this
music
ebbs
and
flows
there
is
an
antiphonal
chorus
from
all
the
atoms
outside
in
fact
from
the
atoms
of
the
entire
universe
so
today
when
we
examine
the
structure
of
our
knowledge
of
the
atom
and
of
the
universe
we
are
forced
to
conclude
that
the
best
word
to
describe
our
universe
is
music
of
part
of
the
of
lies
about
miles
southeast
of
its
mother
of
the
is
sand
and
is
not
suitable
for
living
folk
have
their
living
almost
entirely
from
summer
visitors
the
rest
is
obtained
from
harbor
scallops
about
three
and
a
half
months
of
the
year
in
the
summer
there
are
three
boats
that
run
from
the
mainland
to
the
carrying
passengers
food
and
cars
but
the
rest
of
the
year
only
one
boat
is
needed
which
ties
up
at
the
mainland
nights
and
makes
the
trip
down
to
in
the
daytime
is
a
fine
trip
too
on
a
good
day
on
one
side
and
the
open
sea
on
the
other
it
makes
an
excellent
trip
of
about
three
hours
what
extent
and
in
what
ways
did
affect
the
of
in
the
nineteenth
century
far
and
in
what
fashion
did
it
modify
the
new
nation
which
was
emerging
in
the
midst
of
the
forces
shaping
the
revolutionary
age
what
extent
did
it
mould
the
morals
and
the
social
economic
and
political
life
and
institutions
of
the
country
complete
picture
is
impossible
partly
because
of
the
limitations
of
space
partly
because
for
millions
of
individuals
who
professed
allegiance
to
the
faith
data
are
unobtainable
more
of
an
obstacle
is
the
difficulty
of
separating
the
influence
of
from
other
factors
a
complete
picture
cannot
be
given
we
can
indicate
some
aspects
of
life
into
which
the
faith
entered
as
at
least
one
creative
factor
times
we
can
say
that
it
was
the
major
factor
in
some
ways
was
the
most
important
aspect
was
the
impact
individually
on
the
millions
who
constituted
the
nation
we
have
seen
a
growing
proportion
although
in
still
a
minority
were
members
of
churches
those
who
did
not
have
a
formal
church
connexion
had
also
felt
the
influence
of
to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent
of
them
had
once
been
members
of
a
church
or
at
least
had
been
given
instruction
in
but
for
one
or
another
reason
had
allowed
the
connexion
to
lapse
form
of
to
which
they
were
exposed
was
for
some
the
of
the
older
stock
for
others
the
of
the
immigration
for
still
others
mostly
of
the
immigration
it
was
and
for
a
small
minority
it
was
all
of
them
played
the
intellectual
social
political
and
economic
attitudes
institutions
and
customs
of
the
nation
most
of
these
had
left
an
impress
and
through
them
had
had
a
share
in
making
the
individual
what
he
was
to
determine
precisely
to
what
extent
and
exactly
in
what
ways
any
individual
showed
the
effects
of
would
be
impossible
best
only
an
approximation
could
be
arrived
at
generalize
for
the
entire
nation
would
be
absurd
instance
we
cannot
know
whether
even
for
church
members
the
degree
of
conformity
to
standards
of
morality
increased
or
declined
as
the
proportion
of
church
members
in
the
population
rose
temptation
is
to
say
that
as
the
percentage
of
church
members
mounted
the
degree
of
discipline
exercised
by
the
churches
lessened
and
the
trend
was
towards
conformity
to
the
general
level
this
cannot
be
proved
know
that
in
the
early
part
of
the
century
many
congregations
took
positive
action
against
members
who
transgressed
the
ethical
codes
to
which
the
majority

its

the

would
be
something
new
in

and
to
do
so
in
such
fashion
that

the

have
difficulty
comprehending
this

misgivings

also
without
suffering
any
adverse
effects
in
his
worldly

a
toughness

that

let
us
not
be

about
virtue
this
was
not
virtue
as
we
understand
the
word
today
and
it
did
not
mean
an
abandonment
of
the
belief
in

the
virtue
simply
meant
mastery

correct
observance
of
three

in

to
dignify
the
indisputably
magical

more
to

to

may
have
derived
its

its
psychology
was
pure
early
is
well
evidenced
by
the
doctrines
carried
over
in
the
idea
of
the
inward
turning
of

the
enjoinder
to
put
aside

so
that
a

fact
the
antipathy
to
outward
ceremonies
hailed
by
modern
exponents
as
so
uniquely
characteristic
of
the
direct
thinking
was
a
feature
of
too
was
the
insistence
on
the
relativity
of
the
external
world
and
the
ideas
that
language
and
things
perceived
by
consciousness
were
poor
substitutes
indeed
for
immediate
perception
by
pure
indwelling
spirit
the
opposition
of
pure

to
ratiocinating
consciousness
maintains
that
cognitive
things
are
only
the
surface
of
experience
of
its
features
attractive
to
the
is
its
irreverence
for
tradition
and
dogma
and
for
sacred
texts
patriarch
is
supposed
to
have
relegated
sacred
scriptures
for
use
in
an
outhouse
this
is
not
the
spirit
of
freedom
of
action
for
which
the
mistakes
it
is
simply
that
in
tradition
as
in
all
good
mysticisms
books

irrelevant
to
the
acquisition

a
positive
handicap

of

confusion
the
use
of

to
shake
the

on

originated
with
fourth

third

the
koan
is
not
basically
a
new
device
is
important
for
an
understanding
of
to
realize
that
the
esoteric
preoccupations
of
the
select
few
cannot
be
the
doctrine
of
the
common
man
the
supernatural
atmosphere
of
cosmic
government
only
the
ruling
elite
was
ever
concerned
with
a
ordering
of
nature
popular
religion
aimed
at
more
personal
benefits
from
magical
powers
this
is
only
natural
witness
the
haste
with
which
modern
man
gobbles
the
latest
wonder
drug
anchoritism
was
theoretically
aimed
at
a
mystic
pantheist
union
with
the
divine
personal
salvation
being
achieved
when
the
mystical
recluse
united
with
divine
essence
this
esoteric
doctrine
was
lost
in
the
shuffle
to
acquire
special
powers
anchorite
strove
in
fact
to
magically
influence
the
world
of
spirits
in
the
same
way
that
the
divine
emperor
manifested
his
power
the
metaphysic
of
mystical
union
for
salvation
was
distilled
down
to
a
bare
and
for
this
reason
the
mystic
in
did
not
long
remain
in
isolated
contemplation
the
literature
reveals
as
soon
as
an
early
master
attained
fame
in
seclusion
he
was
called
out
into
the
world
to
exercise
his
powers
early
masters
attracted
disciples
because
of
their
presumed
ability
to
perform
miracles
of
often
insist
that
very
early
doctrine
opposed
the
rampant
supernaturalism
of
and
proposed
instead
a
more
mature
less
credulous
view
of
the
universe
support
of
this
stories
from
the
early
literature
are
cited
to
show
that
attacks
the
idea
of
supernatural
power
actually
these
accounts
reveal
the
supernatural
powers
that
the
masters
were
in
fact
supposed
to
possess
as
well
as
the
extreme
degree
of
popular
credulity
one
day
going
up
which
was
believed
to
have
been
inhabited
by
with
supernatural
powers
met
with
a
monk
whose
eyes
emitted
strange
light
went
along
the
pass
talking
with
each
other
for
a
short
while
until
they
came
to
a
river
roaring
with
torrent
being
no
bridge
the
master
had
to
stop
at
the
shore
but
his
companion
crossed
the
river
walking
on
the
water
and
beckoned
to
to
follow
him
said

thou
art
an

have
doubled
you
up
before
thou
got
over
there
monk
then
understood
the
spiritual
attainment
of
and
praised
him
as
a
true
second
tale
shows
still
more
clearly
the
kind
of
powers
a
truly
spiritual
monk
could
possess
one
occasion
saw
a
stranger
monk
flying
through
the
air
that
monk
came
down
and
approached
him
with
a
respectful
salutation
he
asked
art
thou
from
this
morning
replied
the
other
set
out
from
said
the
teacher
art
thou
so
late
stopped
responded
the
man
several
times
to
look
at
beautiful
sceneries
mayst
have
supernatural
powers
exclaimed
yet
thou
must
give
back
the
of
to
me
the
monk
praised
saying
have
come
over
to
in
order
to
worship
and
met
unexpectedly
with
and
after
giving
the
master
some
palm
leaves
he
brought
from
went
back
through
the

the
popular
mind
was
no
exception
to
the
ideas
of
coarse
magic
that
dominated
closer
look
at
modern
reveals
many
magical
carryovers
that
are
still
part
of
popular
attitudes
the

the
universe
is
still
populated
with
spiritual
beings
who
have
to
be
appeased

so
on

of

is
difficult
to
reconcile
with
such
formulas
as
you
demons

other
spiritual

now
offer
this
to
you
and
may
this
food

that

the
natural
man
is
spiritually
dead
and
blind
as
through
one
man
sin
entered
into
the
world
and
through
sin
death
and
thus
death
has
passed
unto
all
men

all
have
sinned
also
when
you
were
dead
by

of
your
offenses
and
sins
if
our

the
god
of
this

has
blinded
their
unbelieving
minds
that
they
should
not

we

effected
through

from
incorruptible
through

the
outcome
of
works
lest
anyone
may
boast
his

a
magazine
my
name

this
issue
that
you

marks
my
anniversary
came
into
being
years
ago
had
one
primary
purpose
to
help
men
and
women
everywhere
to
know
better
and
through
knowing
better
to
become
happier
and
more
effective
people
purpose
has
never
changed
you
read
me
you
are
holding
in
your
hands
the
product
of
many
minds
and
hearts
of
the
people
who
speak
through
my
pages
are
famous
others
unknown
work
with
their
hands
have
walked
through
pain
and
sorrow
to
bring
you
their
message
of
hope
are
so
filled
with
gratitude
for
the
gift
of
life
and
the
love
of
that
their
joy
spills
out
on
the
paper
and
brightens
the
lives
of
thousands
whom
they
have
never
known
and
will
never
see
years
ago
there
were
no
at
all
month
a
million
will
circulate
all
over
the
world
in
the
publishing
field
consider
this
astounding
do
not
understand
how
a
small
magazine
with
no
advertising
and
no
newsstand
sale
could
have
achieved
such
a
following
me
the
explanation
is
very
simple
am
not
doing
anything
of
myself
am
merely
a
channel
for
something
is
this
something
cannot
define
it
fully
is
the
force
in
the
universe
that
makes
men
love
goodness
even
when
they
turn
away
from
it
is
the
power
that
holds
the
stars
in
their
orbits
but
allows
the
wind
to
bend
a
blade
of
grass
is
the
whisper
in
the
heart
that
urges
each
one
to
be
better
than
he
is
is
wistful
yearning
for
a
world
of
justice
and
peace
things
are
possible
to
but
chooses
usually
to
work
through
people
such
people
sense
that
they
are
being
used
sometimes
not
years
ago
troubled
by
the
rising
tide
of
materialism
in
the
world
a
businessman
and
a
minister
asked
themselves
if
there
might
not
be
a
place
for
a
small
magazine
in
which
men
and
women
regardless
of
creed
or
color
could
set
forth
boldly
their
religious
convictions
and
bear
witness
to
the
power
of
faith
to
solve
the
endless
problems
of
living
businessman
was
minister
was
had
any
publishing
experience
but
they
had
faith
in
their
idea
borrowed
a
typewriter
raised
about
in
contributions
hired
a
secretary
persuaded
a
couple
of
young
men
to
join
them
for
almost
no
pay
and
began
mailing
out
a
collection
of
unstapled
leaflets
that
they
called
to
the
big
established
magazines
my
first
efforts
seemed
feeble
indeed
from
the
start
they
had
two
important
ingredients
sincerity
and
realism
people
who
told
the
stories
were
sincere
the
stories
they
told
were
true
example
early
in
my
life
when
one
of
my
editorial
workers
wanted
to
find
out
how
churches
and
philanthropic
organizations
met
the
needs
of
he
just
ask
questions
went
and
lived
in
the
slums
as
a
sidewalk
derelict
for
ten
days
was
nearly
years
ago
is
my
executive
editor
today
of
you
are
familiar
sure
with
the
story
of
my
early
struggles
the
fire
in
that
destroyed
everything
even
our
precious
list
of
subscribers
help
and
sympathy
that
were
forthcoming
from
everywhere
crisis
later
on
when
debts
seemed
about
to
overwhelm
me
was
when
a
remarkable
woman
came
to
my
aid
not
so
much
with
money
as
with
wisdom
and
courage
not
living
up
to
your
own
principles
she
told
my
discouraged
people
so
preoccupied
that
let
your
faith
grow
dim
do
you
want
a
hundred
thousand
subscribers
them
then
believe
you
are
getting
them
and
you
will
have
them
the
subscribers
became
a
reality
then
now
a
million
are
in
circulation

me
available

teachers
throughout
the
land

helps
them

back
into
schools

and
moral
values

easy
to
hold
and
read
years
ago
it
became
possible
to
finance
a
edition
for
blind
readers
these
exciting
years
have
been
fortunate
for
although
have
never
offered
great
financial
inducements
talent

found
its
way
to
me
who
so
ably
organizes
business
operations
who
guides
circulation
and
who
travel
widely
calling
on
business

our
newspaper
behind
this

am
sure
that
was
happy
too
about
that
support
was
the
oldest
and
most
influential
paper
in
with
a
reputation
for
speaking
out
against
tyranny
grandfather
had
been
stoned
because
of
his
editorials
own
earliest
memories
are
of
exiles
my
three
brothers
and
were
taken
often
to
the
to
visit
relatives
while
my
father
stayed
on
to
fight
the
dictator
it
was
my
turn
too
printed
the
truth
as
knew
it
about
and
rejoiced
to
see
his
regime
topple
of
us
was
aware
that
the
biggest
fight
was
still
ahead
was
full
of
hope
as
came
into
a
week
however
began
to
suspect
that
something
was
wrong
was
bringing
not
freedom
but
hatred
spent
long
hours
before
the
spitting
out
promises
of
revenge
showed
us
how
he
dealt
with
his
enemies
he
executed
them
before
cameras
home
sets
children
were
watching
the
death
throes
of
men
who
were
shot
before
the
paredon
the
firing
wall
reforms
seemed
bent
on
coupling
them
with
vengeance
schools
were
rising
but
with
this
went
a
harsh
proclamation
any
academic
degree
earned
during
regime
was
invalid
aid
had
promised
cheaper
housing
arbitrarily
he
cut
all
rents
in
half
whether
the
landlord
was
a
millionaire
speculator
or
a
widow
whose
only
income
was
the
rental
of
a
spare
room
another
law
hundreds
of
farms
were
seized
workers
had
their
wages
cut
almost
in
half
this
only
cents
a
day
was
paid
in
cash
the
rest
in
script
usable
only
in
suspicion
was
growing
that
was
a
my
mind
began
to
review
his
use
of
hate
to
gain
support
his
his
division
of
society
into
two
classes
one
the
hero
the
other
the
villain
most
disturbing
of
all
were
the
advisers
he
called
to
sit
with
him
in
the
many
came
from
countries
should
do
about
it
asked
myself
had
watched
handling
his
enemies
before
the
paredon
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
if
crossed
him
mobs
would
appear
outside
our
windows
shouting
should
do
was
proud
of
the
new
buildings
which
housed
now
the
rotogravures
gleaming
behind
glass
doors
the
thump
and
whir
of
our
new
presses
was
a
powerful
medium
but
it
could
speak
only
if
told
it
to
one
day
early
in
sat
down
at
my
desk
and
suddenly
was
aware
of
the
crucifix
was
a
simple
ivory
crucifix
which
my
mother
had
given
me
had
mounted
it
on
velvet
and
hung
it
over
my
desk
to
remind
me
always
to
use
the
power
of
the
paper
in
a
manner
it
seemed
almost
as
if
were
looking
down
at
me
with
sadness
in
eyes
saying
will
lose
the
paper
may
lose
your
life
do
you
have
any
choice
knew
in
that
moment
that
did
not
have
any
choice
that
day
on
began
to
write
editorials
about
the
things
did
not
think
correct
in
regime
often
a
beginning
bodybuilder
has
to
do
his
training
secretly
either
because
his
parents
want
to
lift
all
those
old
barbell
things
because
stunt
your
growth
or
because
childish
taunts
from
his
schoolmates
like
lookit
whaddya
gonna
do
with
all
those
muscles
of
which
he
has
none
at
the
time
all
a
gotta
have
a
little
ego
a
genuine
pleasure
to
tell
you
about
an
entirely
happy
bodybuilder
who
has
never
had
to
train
in
secret
has
never
heard
one
unkind
word
from
his
parents
and
never
has
been
taunted
by
his
schoolmates
happy
always
smiling
lad
with
the
sunny
disposition
is
our
new
from
discouraging
his
parents
urge
him
on
to
greater
and
greater
accomplishments
of
admonishing
him
to
let
the
weights
alone
they
personally
took
him
to
that
master
bodybuilding
authority
they
have
entrusted
to
better
hands
because
le
professeur
knows
his
muscles
from
the
mastoideus
of
the
neck
right
down
to
the
tibialis
anticus
of
the
leg
and
better
still
he
knows
just
what
exercises
work
best
for
them
and
what
principles
to
combine
them
with
for
fast
fast
muscle
growth
because
the
good
professor
teaches
only
methods
at
his
famous
which
is
located
at
in
you
have
read
the
case
histories
of
some
of
his
pupils
every
pupil
has
a
physique
title
of
some
kind
or
other
who
is
our
newest
whose
story
appeared
here
two
issues
ago
who
was
with
us
last
month
who
recently
won
the
subdivision
award
in
the
event
and
a
host
of
others
the
professor
knows
his
muscles
when
was
just
he
was
only
tall
and
weighed
an
astounding
pounds
and
his
greatest
desire
was
to
pack
on
some
weight
that
time
he
began
reading
and
and
he
learned
of
the
famous
way
to
fast
weight
gaining
so
many
illustrations
and
reading
so
many
testimonials
to
the
value
of
and
those
two
food
supplements
he
decided
to
try
them
and
see
what
they
could
do
for
him
sir
they
did
real
great
in
almost
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
it
bodyweight
was
increasing
rapidly
course
he
did
some
exercising
crazy
about
water
skiing
and
swimming
and
this
vigorous
exercise
in
conjunction
with
the
added
food
supplements
packed
pounds
of
solid
muscle
on
his
skinny
frame
has
always
had
shapely
legs
from
swimming
and
water
skiing
and
really
have
to
work
them
very
much
he
was
totally
dissatisfied
with
his
upper
body
was
muscular
but
it
symmetrical
real
nothing
torso
says
never
seemed
to
widen
just
got
longer
and
longer
when
he
went
to
at
once
saw
what
the
trouble
was
and
he
knew
just
how
to
correct
it
his
gym
the
professor
has
some
of
the
most
knocked
out
equipment
since
is
a
specialist
in
torso
development
and
he
has
long
favored
the
technique
in
which
one
exercise
of
the
is
a
pressing
or
pushing
movement
which
accents
one
sector
of
a
muscle
group
in
a
specific
way
followed
by
a
pulling
exercise
which
works
the
opposing
sector
of
the
same
muscle
group
right
away
introduced
to
his
famous
moon
bench
and
proceeded
to
teach
him
his
first
consisting
of
the
the
pull
part
of
the
which
dramatically
widens
the
ribcage
and
strongly
affects
the
muscles
of
the
upper
back
and
chest
and
the
which
specifically
works
on
the
chest
to
build
those
wide
gladiator
pecs
while
stimulating
the
upper
lats
and
frontal
deltoids
you
can
see
in
this
the
entire
area
is
vigorously
exercised
in
alternate
sectors
by
alternate
exercises
so
the
complete
torso
remains
all
the
time
when
has
completed
four
complete
the
professor
allows
him
about
a
rest
period
before
starting
him
on
four
complete
is
made
up
of
similar
exercises
but
this
time
done
with
dumbbells
and
using
both
moon
and
flat
benches
push
exercise
of
this
is
the
done
with
elbows
well
pulled
back
and
with
a
greater
downward
stretch
of
the
pectorals
not
possible
with
the
barbell
variation
need
the
barbell
variation
to
build
width
and
mass
in
the
pecs
dumbbell
variation
develops
a
most
classically
sculptured
outline
to
the
pull
exercise
in
this
is
the
how
strongly
the
upper
lats
and
serratus
are
worked
in
this
fine
exercise
because
of
the
concentration
of
force
which
the
dumbbell
variation
affords
the
third
the
push
exercise
is
the
widegrip
while
the
pull
exercise
is
the
with
bent
arms
done
in
this
manner
is
the
greatest
stretcher
ever
invented
is
true
only
if
a
very
wide
grip
is
used
and
only
when
the
greatest
possible
stretch
is
achieved
know
when
made
the
greatest
stretch
because
your
shoulder
blades
will
touch
you
see
the
professor
has
designed
a
piece
of
apparatus
that
forces
the
bodybuilder
to
use
a
grip
has
to
he
just
do
anything
about
it
at
all
as
you
can
also
see
not
a
painful
exercise
at
all
because
the
happy
bodybuilder
looks
as
though
he
were
having
the
time
of
his
life
last
exercise
of
prescribed
program
for
is
a
single
exercise
done
in
individual
sets
with
a
bit
longer
pause
between
sets
this
time
entire
area
is
to
almost
bursting
point
and
takes
time
to
do
a
bit
more
deltoid
shaping
work
has
do
from
four
to
six
sets
of
the
note
the
high
incline
gives
a
wide
flare
to
the
pecs
causing
them
to
flow
dramatically
upward
into
deltoids
and
dramatically
downward
into
the
serratus
and
is
the
kind
of
chest
that
invariably
wins
contests
that
rock
looks
of
the
great
champions
with
four
complete
four
of
four
of
and
four
to
six
sets
of
the
you
can
see
that
has
had
a
terrific
workout
that
cannot
be
improved
upon
contests
are
rarely
won
on
muscle
size
alone
still
is
a
or
of
true
build
aspects
of
physical
development
that
catch
the
eyes
and
which
rightfully
influence
their
decisions
are
symmetry
and
that
hallmark
of
the
true
champion
superior
definition
of
the
muscles
good
definition
is
one
thing
that
all
of
us
can
acquire
with
occasional
workouts
contest
definition
that
dramatic
muscular
separation
of
every
muscle
group
that
seems
as
though
it
must
have
been
carved
by
a
chisel
is
something
quite
different
comes
not
alone
from
training
but
from
certain
exercises
which
the
champion
selects
for
himself
with
the
knowledge
of
exactly
what
works
best
for
him
these
exercises
work
well
for
some
bodybuilders
but
less
spectacularly
for
others
they
are
minority
exercises
and
have
but
a
limited
appeal
they
soon
find
themselves
in
the
limbo
of
the
forgotten
when
the
newest
or
discovers
them
and
puts
them
into
practice
are
we
reacquainted
with
them
and
once
again
see
how
effective
they
really
are
exercise
shall
discuss
in
this
the
first
of
a
new
series
of
articles
on
muscle
of
a
particular
body
part
is
the
it
was
ever
forgotten
for
even
a
moment
cannot
say
because
it
works
perfectly
for
everyone
no
matter
whether
he
has
short
or
long
lengths
is
the
one
exercise
that
drastically
influences
the
definition
of
the
thighs
at
the
hipline
that
mark
of
the
champion
that
sets
him
apart
from
all
other
bodybuilders
a
criterion
of
muscle
drama
that
is
unforgettable
to
judges
and
audiences
alike
the
facet
of
muscular
development
that
wins
prizes
of
the
thighs
at
the
uppermost
part
is
quite
commonly
seen
in
most
championship
lifters
which
is
easily
understandable
is
a
split
and
all
lifters
practice
this
in
their
regular
workouts
for
purely
definition
purposes
used
in
conjunction
with
your
regular
programs
a
heavy
weight
is
not
needed
a
lighter
weight
works
much
better
because
a
greater
more
extensive
split
can
be
performed
in
several
sets
of
high
reps
once
or
twice
each
week
it
will
not
be
long
before
your
entire
upper
leg
takes
on
a
definition
in
which
the
muscles
look
like
wire
cables
writhing
and
twisting
under
the
skin
there
is
no
reason
why
this
fine
exercise
should
not
find
its
way
into
your
leg
program
at
all
times
for
the
following
suggestions
show
why
it
is
so
effective
a
complete
thigh
exercise
places
terrific
tension
on
the
leg
muscles
from
start
to
finish
of
each
repetition
improves
balance
and
control
for
the
bodybuilder
and
helps
to
make
more
easily
and
more
correctly
performed
increases
flexibility
of
the
legs
speeds
muscle
growth
and
power
development
even
for
the
advanced
bodybuilder
because
each
hip
and
leg
is
exercised
separately
thus
enabling
a
massive
concentrated
effort
to
be
focused
on
each
need
your
for
this
fine
exercise
and
the
way
done
your
in
position
and
adjust
their
height
so
that
this
will
correspond
to
the
height
of
your
shoulders
when
you
are
in
a
deep
leg
split
as
for
a
heavy
a
barbell
across
them
grasp
the
bar
which
will
rest
against
the
back
of
your
neck
extend
your
feet
forward
and
backward
until
you
are
in
a
deep
leg
split
raise
the
weight
by
straightening
your
front
leg
without
moving
your
feet
the
front
knee
is
straight
and
locked
allow
it
to
bend
again
until
you
feel
the
bar
come
lightly
into
contact
with
the
sides
of
the
you
have
taken
a
breather
reverse
the
position
of
your
legs
so
that
the
front
thigh
of
the
previous
exercise
is
now
to
the
rear
and
the
rear
thigh
now
to
the
front
and
perform
the
same
movement
in
the
same
manner
the
in
a
nutshell
should
have
a
couple
of
training
partners
to
stand
by
when
you
make
your
first
experiments
just
for
safety
should
also
begin
this
exercise
with
a
very
light
barbell
until
you
become
accustomed
to
it
wobble
and
weave
quite
a
bit
at
first
worry
your
first
training
experiment
has
ended
there
will
be
a
big
improvement
and
almost
before
you
know
it
be
raising
and
lowering
yourself
just
like
a
veteran
suggested
that
you
hold
the
bar
at
the
back
of
the
neck
no
reason
why
you
make
some
experiments
with
the
bar
held
in
front
of
the
neck
lifters
and
lifters
would
both
benefit
enormously
by
practicing
those
variations
providing
that
they
remember
to
make
alternate
sets
with
the
left
and
right
leg
to
the
front
most
beautiful
bed
of
pansies
seen
was
in
a
yard
on
a
sizzling
day
are
supposed
to
like
it
cool
but
those
great
velvety
flowers
were
healthy
and
perky
in
the
glaring
sun
sought
out
the
gardener
and
asked
him
what
he
did
to
produce
such
beauties
in
that
weather
seemed
puzzled
by
my
question
just
love
them
he
said
more
talked
with
him
the
more
convinced
became
that
that
was
the
secret
of
their
riotous
blooming
course
his
love
was
expressed
in
intelligent
care
planted
the
pansy
seeds
himself
buying
them
from
a
pansy
specialist
specialists
learned
have
done
a
great

cold

was
my
morale
builder
its
mass
of
bright
bloom
set
in
a
border
of

made
my
spirits
rise
every
time
looked
at
it
strawberries
in
pansies
are
far
more
exciting
in
than
in
that
late
winter
pickup
when
you
are
so
tired
of
cold
and
snow
that
you
feel
you
just
take
another
day
of
it
day
will
come
in
midsummer
when
you
find
your
plants
becoming
leggy
running
to
foliage
at
the
expense
of
blossoms
pegging
down
each
separate
branch
to
the
earth
using
a
bobby
pin
to
hold
it
there
the
flowers
keep
the
soil
dampened
and
each
of
the
branches
will
take
root
and
become
a
little
plant
and
go
on
blooming
for
the
rest
of
the
season
soon
as
an
experimental
tug
assures
you
that
roots
have
taken
over
cut
it
off
from
the
mother
plant
second
and
also
good
practice
is
to
shear
off
the
tops
leaving
an
inch
high
stub
with
just
a
leaf
or
two
on
each
branch
plants
will
bud
and
blossom
in
record
time
and
will
behave
just
as
they
did
in
early
spring
like
to
shear
half
my
plants
at
a
time
leaving
one
half
of
them
to
blossom
while
the
second
half
is
getting
started
on
its
new
round
of
blooming
no
one
needs
to
tell
you
that
the
way
to
stop
all
bloom
is
to
let
the
blossoms
go
to
seed
aim
different
from
ours
is
to
provide
for
the
coming
generation
done
her
work
is
accomplished
and
she
ignores
the
plant
is
a
word
of
advice
when
you
go
shopping
for
your
pansy
seeds
to
a
reputable
grower
preferably
a
pansy
specialist
is
no
harder
to
raise
big
healthy
blooming
plants
than
weak
sickly
little
things
in
fact
it
is
easier
you
will
never
get
better
flowers
than
the
seed
you
grow
people
think
that
pansies
last
only
a
few
weeks
then
their
period
of
growth
and
bloom
is
over
is
not
true
the
plants
are
cared
for
and
protected
over
the
winter
the
second
year
is
more
prolific
than
the
first
you
like
to
grow
exhibition
pansies
about
half
the
branches
from
each
plant
leaving
only
the
strongest
with
the
largest
buds
flowers
will
be

have
character
stick
to
their
principles
insist
upon
their
due
but
grow
and
bloom
with

given

salad
with

tomato
is
a
popular
and
wonderfully
healthful
addition
to
a
meal
but
add
an
avocado
and
you
have
something
really
special
delightful
tropical
fruit
has
become
in
the
past
thirty
years
because
modern
transportation
methods
have
made
it
possible
to
ship
avocados
anywhere
in
the
has
a
great
many
assets
to
recommend
it
and
if
you
made
avocado
a
part
of
your
diet
yet
you
really
should
will
find
that
avocado
is
unlike
any
other
fruit
you
have
ever
tasted
is
roughly
shaped
like
a
large
pear
and
when
properly
ripened
its
dark
green
skin
covers
a
meaty
pulp
that
has
about
the
consistency
of
a
ripe
pear
but
oily
avocado
should
have
a
give
to
it
as
you
hold
it
when
it
is
ripe
flavor
is
neither
sweet
like
a
pear
nor
tart
like
an
orange
it
is
subtle
and
rather
bland
is
a
flavor
that
might
take
a
little
getting
used
to
not
because
it
is
unpleasant
but
because
the
flavor
is
hard
to
define
in
the
light
of
our
experience
with
other
fruits
it
takes
several
eatings
of
avocado
to
catch
that
delightful
quality
in
taste
that
has
made
it
such
a
favorite
throughout
the
world
you
become
an
avocado
fan
you
will
look
forward
to
the
season
each
year
with
eager
anticipation
dormant

no
spray
danger
refrigerated
carriers
have
made
the
shipping
of
avocados
possible
to
any
place
in
the
world
fruit
is
allowed
to
mature
on
the
tree
but
it
is
still
firm
at
this
point
is
brought
to
packing
houses
cleaned
and
graded
as
to
size
and
quality
and
packed
in
protective
excelsior
fruit
is
then
cooled
to
a
temperature
at
which
it
lapses
into
a
sort
of
dormant
state
cooling
does
not
change
the
avocado
in
any
way
it
just
delays
the
natural
softening
of
the
fruit
until
a
grovelike
temperature
room
temperature
is
restored
happens
on
the
shelf
or
in
your
kitchen
of
the
most
attractive
things
about
avocados
is
that
they
do
not
require
processing
of
any
kind
is
no
dyeing
or
waxing
or
gassing
needed
the
temperature
is
controlled
properly
the
avocado
will
delay
its
ripening
until
needed
unlike
other
fruits
one
cannot
eat
the
skin
of
the
avocado
is
thick
much
like
an
egg
skin
so
that
poison
sprays
if
they
are
used
present
no
hazard
to
the
consumer
and
a
cholesterol
reducer
taste
and
versatility
plus
safety
from
spray
poisons
would
be
enough
to
recommend
the
frequent
use
of
such
a
fruit
even
if
its
nutritional
values
were
limited
however
are
very
rich
in

terrifying

many
writers
are
bewitched
by
the
apparently
overwhelming
advantage
an
attacker
would
have
if
he
were
to
strike
with
complete
surprise
using
nuclear
rockets
is
relatively
easy
to
go
a
step
further
and
reason
that
an
attacker
in
possession
of
such
absolute
power
would
simultaneously
destroy
his
cities
and
people
a
nation
defenseless
before
it
why
would
the
attacker
spare
the
people
the
wanton
destruction
of
cities
and
people
be
the
logical
act
of
complete
subjugation
nation

weapons
have
given
the
world
the
means
for
in
hours
or
days
and
now
rockets
have
given
it
the
means
to
destroy
itself
in
minutes
this
point
it
should
be
painfully
obvious
that
cities
being
soft
and
the
people
within
them
are
ideally
suited
to
destruction
by
nuclear
weapons
because
this
vulnerability
is
mutual
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
neither
side
to
destroy
the
cities
at
least
so
long
as
the
opponent
has
nuclear
weapons
with
which
to
effect
reprisal
should
be
appallingly
apparent
that
is
not
a
profitable
military
tactic
have
given
us
a
capability
which
could
be
used
in
two
different
ways
could
be
used
to
attack
a
people
which
would
inevitably
mean
the
loss
of
the
own
people
or
they
could
be
used
with
discrimination
to
destroy
the
military
force
our
national
interest
lies
in
being
able
to
fight
and
win
a
war
rather
than
committing
national
suicide
then
we
must
take
a
much
more
penetrating
look
at
ballistic
missiles
must
determine
whether
missiles
can
win
a
war
all
by
themselves
must
make
certain
that
the
aircraft
is
finished
before
we
give
the
entire
job
to
the
missile
are
very
valuable
weapons
but
they
also
have
their
too
little
known
limitations
of
a
ballistic
trajectory
the
location
of
a
fixed
target
must
be
known
quite
accurately
missiles
in
submarines
on
barges
railroads
highways
surface
vessels
and
in
the
air
provides
them
with
passive
protection
by
taking
advantage
of
the
gravest
weakness
of
ballistic
missiles
today
the
extreme
difficulty
of
destroying
a
mobile
or
moving
target
with
such
weapons
must
first
detect
a
fleeting
mobile
or
moving
target
decide
that
it
is
worthy
of
destruction
select
the
missile
to
be
fired
against
the
target
compute
ballistics
for
the
flight
and
prepare
the
missile
for
firing
if
all
these
operations
could
be
performed
instantaneously
the
still
has
a
time
of
flight
to
the
target
of
about
minutes
if
the
target
can
significantly
change
its
location
in
something
less
than
minutes
the
probability
of
having
destroyed
it
is
drastically
lowered
of
this
it
would
appear
inevitable
that
an
increasing
percentage
of
strategic
missiles
will
seek
in
mobility
at
least
until
missile
defenses
are
perfected
which
have
an
exceedingly
high
kill
probability
order
to
destroy
the
mobile
moving

imprecisely
located
strategic

we
must
have
a

in

this
operation
can
be
performed
by

manned

appear
to
be
the
only
means
available
to
us
seems
reasonable
that
if
general
nuclear
war
is
not
to
be
one
cataclysmic
act
of
burning
each
citizens
to
cinders
we
must
have
a
manned
strategic
force
of
aircraft
capable
of
going
into
or
to
find
and
destroy
their
strategic
forces
which
continued
to
threaten
us
us
suppose
the
decide
to
build
a
force
is
entirely
feasible
to
employ
aircraft
such
as
the
or
in
operations
against
missiles
we
stop
thinking
in
terms
of
tremendous
multimegaton
nuclear
weapons
and
consider
employing
much
smaller
nuclear
weapons
which
may
be
more
appropriate
for
most
important
military
targets
it
would
seem
that
the
or
could
carry
a
great
many
small
nuclear

aircraft
with
a
load
of
small
nuclear
weapons
could
very
conceivably
be
given
a
mission
to
suppress
all

operating
within
a
specified
geographic
area
of
provided
that
we
had
used
some
of
our
to
degrade

defenses
before
our

got
there
aircraft
could
be
used
to
destroy
other
mobile
fleeting
and
imprecisely
located
targets
as
well
as
the
known
fixed
and
hardened
targets
which
can
also
be
destroyed
by

then
we
planning
a
larger
more
important
role
for

aircraft
there
any
other
way
to
do
the
job
of
our
strategic
forces
mobile
and
hardened
hardened
and
and
airborne
means
that
it
will
take
some
time
perhaps
weeks
to
destroy
a
strategic

under
these
circumstances
cannot
be
one
massive
exchange
of
nuclear
devastation
will
survive
a
surprise

and
these
forces
will
give
depth
or
considerable
duration
to
the
conflict
forces
which
survive
the
initial
attack
must
be
found
and
destroyed
mobile
forces
must
be
found
and
destroyed
how
does
one
go
about
the
job
of
finding
and
destroying
mobile
forces
are
not
susceptible
to
wholesale
destruction
by
ballistic
missile
day
many
years
in
the
future
true
spacecraft
will
be
able
to
find
and
destroy
mobile
targets
until
we
have
an
effective
spacecraft
the
answer
to
the
problem
is
manned
aircraft
the
aircraft
which
we
have
today
are
tied
to
large
soft
airfields
rockets
can
destroy
airfields
with
ease
then
is
our
problem
aircraft
are
vital
to
winning
a
war
today
because
they
can
perform
those
missions
which
a
missile
is
totally
incapable
of
performing
but
the
airfield
on
which
the
aircraft
is
completely
dependent
is
doomed
by
the
missile
makes
aircraft
a
or
one
mission
weapon
are
mighty
expensive
if
you
can
use
them
only
once
is
the
point
on
which
so
many
people
have
written
off
the
aircraft
in
favor
of
the
missile
remember
this
it
the
aircraft
which
is
vulnerable
to
nuclear
rockets
it
is
the
airfield
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on
the
ground
and
you
have
essentially
eliminated
its
vulnerability
to
ballistic
missiles
are
four
rather
obvious
ways
to
reduce
or
eliminate
the
vulnerability
of
aircraft
on
the
ground
aircraft
in
hangars
when
they
are
on
the
ground
aircraft
which
can
take
off
from
small
airfields
with
runways
we
could
use
all
the
small
airfields
we
have
in
this
country
we
could
disperse
our
strategic
aircraft
by
a
factor
of
or
more
nuclear
propulsions
to
keep
our
military
aircraft
in
the
air
for
the
majority
of
their
useful
life
very
high
ratio
engines
develop
a
military
aircraft
have
the
technology
today
with
which
to
build
aircraft
shelters
which
could
withstand
at
least
could
put
a
portion
of
our
strategic
bombers
in
such
shelters
bombers
can
be
developed
which
would
have
the
capability
to
take
off
from
runways
but
they
would
require
more
powerful
engines
than
we
have
today
is
little
enthusiasm
for
spending
money
to
develop
more
powerful
engines
because
of
the
erroneous
belief
that
the
aircraft
has
been
made
obsolete
by
the
missile
same
preoccupation
with
missiles
at
the
expense
of
aircraft
has
resulted
in
our
effort
to
develop
nuclear
propulsion
for
aircraft
seldom
hears
the
analogy
nuclear
propulsion
will
do
for
the
aircraft
what
it
has
already
done
for
the
submarine
for
some
reason
such
as
economy
we
are
not
going
to
develop
aircraft
nuclear
propulsion
with
a
sense
of
national
urgency
then
we
should
turn
our
effort
to
developing
jet
engines
with
a
ratio
of
or
to
one
powerplants
such
as
these
vertical
takeoff
and
landing
combat
aircraft
could
be
built
example
a
engine
would
power
a
supersonic
fighter
a
engine
a
supersonic
aircraft
weighing
pounds
could
rise
vertically
reason
that
we
are
not
going
ahead
full
speed
to
develop
high
engines
is
that
it
would
cost
perhaps
a
billion
dollars
and
you
spend
that
sort
of
money
if
aircraft
are
obsolete
aircraft
are
no
longer
helpless
on
airfields
they
are
no
longer
vulnerable
to
our
bombers
were
today
capable
of
surviving
a
surprise
missile
attack
and
because
of
infinite
dispersion
or
long
endurance
had
the
capability
to
strike
at
again
and
again
and
again
those
bombers
would
unquestionably
assure
our
military
dominance
would
have
the
means
to
seek
out
and
destroy
the
force
whether
it
were
fixed
or
mobile
such
a
force
of
manned
bombers
we
could
bring
enormous
pressure
to
bear
on
an
enemy
and
this
pressure
would
be
selective
and
extremely
discriminating
need
to
kill
an
entire
city
and
all
its
people
because
we
lacked
the
precision
and
reconnaissance
to
selectively
disarm
the
military
force
first
necessity
at
the
very
outset
of
war
is
reconnaissance
a
few
years
we
will
have
semiautomatic
missile
observation
system
in
the
case
of
moving
targets
and
targets
which
have
limited
mobility
what
will
their
location
be
when
it
is
time
to
destroy
them
targets
have
we
successfully
knocked
out
ballistic
missile
cannot
today
tell
you
if
it
was
successful
or
unsuccessful
targets
still
remain
to
be
hit
crucial
questions
must
be
answered
by
reconnaissance
will
be
hard
put
to
see
through
clouds
and
to
see
in
the
dark
if
this
is
some
day
possible
there
remains
the
time
of
flight
of
a
missile
to
its
overseas
target
the
target
can
change
its
position
significantly
during
the
minutes
the
missile
is
in
the
air
on
its
way
the
probability
of
the
missile
destroying
the
target
is
drastically
reduced
reconnaissance
is
vital
but
only
reconnaissance
will
allow
us
to
terminate
the
war
favorably
would
be
priceless
to
have
an
aircraft
to
gather
that
reconnaissance
could
operate
under
the
clouds
and
perform
infrared
photography
through
clouds
and
at
night
would
be
even
more
valuable
because
that
same
aircraft
could
immediately
destroy
any
targets
it
discovered
no
need
to
wait
for
a
missile
to
come
all
the
way
from
the
with
the
chance
that
the
target
if
it
were
mobile
would
be
gone
large
aircraft
such
as
the
or
could
carry
perhaps
or
small
nuclear
weapons
people
realize
that
one
kiloton
of
nuclear
explosive
power
will
create
psi
overpressure
at
feet
put
another
way
the
hardest
missile
site
planned
today
could
be
destroyed
by
placing
a
warhead
the
size
of
those
used
in
and
within
to
feet
of
the
target
is
our
lack
of
extreme
accuracy
which
forces
the
use
of
very
large
yield
nuclear
weapons
we
have
radar
which
has
such
high
resolution
that
the
radar
picture
clearly
shows
individual
buildings
runways
separate
spans
of
bridges
these
keen
eyes
and
small
nuclear
weapons
delivered
with
accuracy
military
forces
can
be
directly
attacked
with
minimum
damage
to
urban
areas
we
fail
to
develop
the
means
to
hunt
down
and
destroy
the
military
force
with
extreme
care
and
precision
and
if
war
comes
in
spite
of
our
most
ardent
desires
for
peace
our
choice
of
alternatives
will
be
truly
frightening
lyric
beauties
of
its
elemental
rhythms
and
infectious
melodies
make
it
a
source
of
pure
pleasure
for
almost
all
music
listeners
for
students
of
musical
forms
and
classifiers
the
work
presents
its
problems
it
requires
only
five
players
it
would
seem
to
fall
into
the
category
of
chamber
music
yet
it
calls
for
a
double
bass
an
instrument
generally
regarded
as
symphonic
the
piece
is
written
in
five
movements
rather
than
the
conventional
four
of
most
quintets
and
this
gives
the
opus
a
serenade
or
divertimento
flavor
many
and
frequent
performances
of
the
serve
to
emphasize
the
dual
nature
of
its
writing
renditions
are
of
symphonic
dimensions
with
the
contrabass
given
free
rein
interpretations
present
the
music
as
an
essentially
intimate
creation
these
readings
the
double
bass
is
either
kept
discreetly
in
the
background
or
it
is
dressed
in
attire
the
musical
equivalent
of
a
bull
in
a
china
shop
was
struck
anew
by
the
divergent
approaches
when
in
the
course
of
one
afternoon
and
evening
listened
to
no
fewer
than
ten
different
performances
occasion
for
this
marathon
reissue
in
its
series
of
the
version
me
say
at
the
outset
that
the
music
sounded
as
sparkling
on
the
last
playing
as
it
did
on
the
first
considered
alone
or
in
relation
to
other
editions
is
a
document
of
prime
importance
was
one
of
the
greatest
players
of
all
time
and
any
commentary
of
his
on
this
repertory
is
valuable
was
a
great
teacher
in
addition
to
being
a
great
performer
and
the
fact
that
four
of
the
ten
versions
listened
to
are
by
pupils
and
also
sheds
light
on
the
pedagogical
skills
pianistic
traits
are
common
to
all
five
renditions
most
notably
the
trill
which
differs
from
the
conventional
trill
in
that
the
two
notes
are
struck
simultaneously
the
most
impressive
testimony
to
distinction
as
a
teacher
is
reflected
by
the
individuality
which
marks
each
approach
as
distinctly
his
own
emphasis
on
structural
clarity
his
innate
rhythmic
vibrancy
and
impetuous
intensity
all
tend
to
stamp
his
reading
as
a
symphonic
one
no
detail
was
too
small
to
receive
attention
from
this
master
and
as
a
result
the
playing
here
has
humor
delicacy
and
radiant
humanity
is
a
interpretation
but
it
is
never
although
pianism
bristles
with
excitement
it
is
meticulously
faithful
to
dynamic
markings
and
phrase
indications
piano
performance
on
this
is
one
that
really
demands
a
search
for
superlatives
the
contribution
am
less
happy
for
one
rather
regret
that
collaborate
with
the
whose
rugged
athletic
playing
was
a
good
deal
closer
to
this
interpretative
outlook
than
the
style
of
the
group
a
technical
standpoint
the
string
playing
is
good
but
the
people
fail
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
things
here
violinist
in
particular
is
very
indulgent
with
swoops
and
slides
and
his
tone
is
pinched
and
edgy
recording
offers
rather
faded
string
tone
but
the
balance
between
the
instruments
is
good
and
the
transfer
is
very
quiet
is
a
break
in
continuity
just
before
the
fourth
variation
in
the
movement
and
suspect
that
this
is
due
to
imperfect
splicing
between
sides
of
the
original
to
the
more
modern
versions
offers
the
most
sophisticated
keyboard
work
detail
in
his
interpretation
has
been
beautifully
thought
out
and
of
these
would
especially
cite
the
delicious
laendler
touch
the
pianist
brings
to
the
fifth
variation
an
obvious
indication
that
he
is
playing
with
musicians
and
the
gossamer
shading
throughout
of
playing
strikes
me
as
finicky
however
for
example
does
he
favor
two
tempos
rather
than
one
for
the
third
movement
assisting
musicians
from
the
are
somewhat
lacking
in
expertise
but
their
contribution
is
rustic
and
appealing
compliments
to
the
double
bass
playing
of
his
scrawny
tottering
sound
adds
a
delightful
hilarity
to
the
performance
edition
is
a
model
of
lucidity
and
organization
is
moreover
a
perfectly
integrated
ensemble
effort
having
lived
with
the
disc
for
some
time
now
find
the
performance
less
exciting
than
either
or
whose
superb
performance
with
the
has
still
to
be
recorded
and
a
good
deal
less
filled
with
humor
than
work
is
very
much
akin
to
but
the
sound
on
his
disc
is
dated
and
you
will
have
a
hard
time
locating
a
copy
of
it
and
editions
give
us
superlative
string
playing
both
in
symphonic
style
crippled
by
unimaginative
piano
playing
has
acquired
some
of
keyboard
manner
but
his
playing
is
of
limited
insight
and
are
both
pleasantly
lyrical
but
rather
slack
and
tensionless
playing
with
a
group
of
musicians
from
the
gives
a
sturdy
reading
in
much
the
same
vein
as
that
of
the
pianists
has
accorded
him
beautiful
sound
and
this
disc
it
sells
for
is
worthy
of
consideration
once
again
to
the
reissue
am
beguiled
anew
by
the
magnificence
of
this
musical
penetration
is
truly
a
of
the
and
its
greatness
is
by
no
means
diminished
by
the
fact
that
it
is
not
quite
perfect
recording
surely
belongs
in
collection
records
always
sound
like
records
the
beginning
of
commercial
recording
new
discs
purported
to
be
indistinguishable
from
have
regularly
been
put
in
circulation
in
perspective
many
of
these
releases
have
a
genuine
claim
to
be
milestones
lacking
absolute
verisimilitude
they
supply
the
ear
and
the
imagination
with
all
necessary
materials
for
of
the
original
the
basis
of
what
they
give
us
we
can
know
how
the
young
sang
appreciate
the
distinctive
qualities
of
under
baton
or
sense
the
type
of
ensemble
created
in
his
years
with
the
the
concept
of
high
fidelity
became
important
some
dozen
years
ago
the
claims
of
technical
improvements
have
multiplied
tenfold
many
cases
the
revolutionary
production
has
offered
no
more
than
sensational
effects
the
first
hearing
was
fascinating
and
the
second
disillusioning
as
the
gap
between
sound
and
substance
became
clearer
innovations
with
better
claims
to
musical
interest
survived
rehearing
to
acquire
in
time
the
status
of
classics
we
return
to
them
today
we
have
no
difficulty
spotting
their
weaknesses
but
we
find
them
still
pleasing
sound
like
records
because
they
provide
a
different
sort
of
experience
than
live
music
difference
is
made
up
of
many
factors
of
them
are
obvious
such
as
the
fact
that
we
associate
recorded
and
live
music
with
our
responses
and
behavior
in
different
types
of
environments
and
social
settings
often
sounds
best
to
me
when
can
dress
informally
and
sit
in
something
more
comfortable
than
a
theatre
seat
the
technical
standpoint
records
differ
from
live
music
to
the
degree
that
they
fail
to
convey
the
true
color
texture
complexity
range
intensity
pulse
and
pitch
of
the
original
alteration
of
one
of
these
factors
is
distortion
although
we
generally
use
that
word
only
for
effects
so
pronounced
that
they
can
be
stated
quantitatively
on
the
basis
of
standard
tests
it
is
the
accumulation
of
distortion
the
fitting
together
of
fractional
bits
until
the
total
reaches
the
threshold
of
our
awareness
that
makes
records
sound
like
records
sound
may
be
good
but
if
you
know
you
know
that
what
you
are
hearing
is
only
a
clever
imitation
new
is
a
major
effort
to
make
a
record
that
sounds
like
a
real
orchestra
rather
than
a
copy
of
one
the
recent
from
it
is
successful
because
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
good
musical
and
engineering
practices
rather
than
on
creating
sensational
effects
of
this
only
those
with
truly
fine
equipment
will
be
able
to
appreciate
the
exact
degree
of
the
triumph
easiest
way
to
describe
this
release
is
to
say
that
it
reproduces
an
interesting
and
effective
performance
with
minimal
alteration
of
its
musical
values
engineering
as
such
never
obtrudes
upon
your
consciousness
effect
of
the
recording
is
very
open
and
natural
with
the
frequency
emphasis
exactly
what
you
would
expect
from
a
live
performance
absence
of
peaky
highs
and
bass
not
only
produces
greater
fidelity
but
it
eliminates
listener
fatigue
contributing
factor
is
the
perspective
the
uniform
aesthetic
distance
which
is
maintained
orchestra
is
far
enough
away
from
you
that
you
miss
the
bow
scrapes
valve
clicks
and
other
noises
incidental
to
playing
you
feel
the
orchestra
is
near
at
hand
and
the
individual
instruments
have
the
same
firm
presence
associated
with
listening
from
a
good
seat
in
an
acoustically
perfect
hall
has
achieved
the
ideal
amount
of
reverberation
music
is
always
allowed
the
living
space
needed
to
attain
its
full
sonority
yet
the
hall
never
intrudes
as
a
timbre
remains
that
of
the
instruments
unclouded
by
resonance
of
this
would
be
wasted
of
course
if
the
performance
lacked
authority
and
musical
distinction
me
it
has
more
of
both
elements
than
the
majority
of
its
competitors
seems
to
have
gone
directly
back
to
the
score
discounting
tradition
and
has
built
his
performance
on
the
intention
to
reproduce
as
faithfully
as
possible
exactly
what
set
down
on
paper
accustomed
to
broader
more
romantic
statements
of
the
symphony
can
be
expected
to
react
strongly
when
they
hear
this
one
losing
the
distinctive
undertow
of
rhythm
the
pacing
is
firm
and
the
performance
has
a
tightly
knit
quality
that
makes
for
maximum
cumulative
effect
non
assai
of
the
first
trio
of
the
scherzo
is
taken
literally
and
may
shock
you
as
the
real
con
of
the
finale
is
likely
to
bring
you
to
your
feet
the
end
however
the
thing
about
this
performance
that
is
most
striking
is
the
way
it
sings
obviously
has
concluded
that
it
is
the
lyric
element
which
must
dominate
in
this
score
and
he
manages
at
times
to
create
the
effect
of
the
whole
orchestra
bursting
into
song
engineering
provides
exactly
the
support
needed
for
such
a
result
many
records
seem
to
reduce
a
work
of
symphonic
complexity
to
a
melody
and
its
accompaniment
technique
invites
you
to
listen
to
the
depth
of
the
orchestration
ear
takes
you
into
the
ensemble
and
you
may
well
become
aware
of
instrumental
details
which
previously
were
apparent
only
in
the
score
is
this
sort
of
experience
that
makes
the
concept
of
high
fidelity
of
real
musical
significance
for
the
home
music
listener
first
substantially
complete
stereo
and
the
only
one
of
its
scope
since
edition
of
for
this
set
is
afraid
likely
to
provide
more
horrid
fascination
than
enjoyment
already
faded
pastel
charms
of
the
naive
music
itself
vanish
entirely
in
melodramatic
contrasts
between
ultravehement
brute
power
and
chilly
if
suave
sentimentality
in
its
frantic
attempts
to
achieve
maximum
dynamic
impact
and
earsplitting
brilliance
the
recording
sounds
as
though
it
had
been
doctored
for
fidelity
home
listener
is
overpowered
all
right
but
the
experience
is
a
far
from
pleasant
one
with
the
penultimate
release
abridgment
for
find
the
cleaner
less
monophonic
version
for
all
its
lack
of
spaciousness
the
more
aurally
tolerable
but
this
may
be
the
result
of
processing
defects
in
my
copies
the
in
on
the
second
day

a

the

a

vast

commonplace
lucky

the

procedure
of
loading

making

to
transfer

technology
in

and

design
is
largely
responsible
for
the
plentiful
interest
in

wonder
if
anyone
ever
bothered
to
make
the
point
that
when
it
comes
to
boats
and
their
motors
excel
over
any
country
in
the
world
in
the
long

whose
technology

not
quite
primitive
is
still
in
the
dark
ages
when
it
comes
to
improving
the
outboard
motor
for
instance
here
is
truly
a
marvel
outboard
engine
of
today
has
a
phenomenal
range
of
one
to
horsepower
unheard
of
a
few
years
ago
for
a
two
cycle
engine
in
quantity
production
engines
can
be
removed
from
a
boat
with
relative
ease
wherein
lies
their
greatest
advantage
cost
is
not
beyond
the
hopes
of
the
pocketbook
the
range
being
about
to
depending
on
size
thought
has
been
given
to
making
life
easier
for
the
growing
boating
population
of
the
country
and
to
making
the
owning
of
a
boat
simpler
was
a
time
when
if
a
man
wanted
to
purchase
a
boat
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
able
to
produce
a
sizeable
amount
of
cash
before
he
could
touch
the
tiller
or
wheel
a
boat
financed
through
a
local
bank
is
done
much
the
same
way
as
an
automobile
loan
is
extended
dealers
and
even
some
manufacturers
who
sell
direct
in
areas
cooperate
in
enabling
you
to
launch

and
pay
later
range
from
one
to
five
years
and
the
interest
rates
and
down
payments
run
about
the
same
as
for
automobiles
course
individual
financing
arrangements
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
earning
power
credit
rating
and
local
bank
policy
motors
insurance
and
boat
repairs
may
also
be
financed
in
the
same
way
as
boats
and
rates
of
interest
for
motors
generally
follow
those
for
home
appliances
the
automobile
was
in
its
embryonic
stage
such
roads
as
existed
were
pretty
much
open
roads
with
the
tacit
understanding
that
horses
should
not
be
unduly
terrified
being
about
the
only
rule
governing
where
when
and
how
fast
a
car
could
go
air
travel
was
in
its
infancy
the
sky
was
considered
big
enough
and
high
enough
for
all
had
enough
to
worry
about
managing
to
get
up
there
and
stay
without
being
burdened
with
rules
once
aloft
was
much
the
same
with
pleasure
boating
at
first
one
come
all
the
fine
the
ungoverned
days
of
the
automobile
and
the
airplane
are
long
since
relegated
to
the
past
so
is
the
carefree
attitude
toward
what
a
boatman
may
and
may
not
do
must
and
should
do
there
is
a
minimum
of
legislative
restriction
on
boating
on
boating
vary
according
to
the
state
in
which
the
craft
is
to
be
used
and
according
to
its
horsepower
may
be
acceptable
in
one
state
may
be
strictly
prohibited
across
the
boundary
line
main
requirement
is
to
be
sure
the
boat
is
numbered
according
to
the
regulations
of
the
state
in
which
the
boat
will
be
principally
used
your
state
has
no
provisions
for
the
numbering
of
pleasure
boats
you
must
apply
for
a
number
from
the
for
any
kind
of
boat
with
mechanical
propulsion
rated
at
more
than
horsepower
before
it
can
be
used
on
waterways
numbering
laws
differ
from
each
other
in
many
ways
are
not
the
same
and
some
states
do
not
require
certain
craft
such
as
sailboats
with
no
power
to
be
registered
at
all
states
have
laws
regulating
the
use
of
boat
trailers
and
some
have
restrictions

there
are
marinas
word
marina
was
coined
by
originally
to
describe
a
waterfront
facility
where
recreational
boats
could
find
protection
and
basic
needs
to
lay
over
in
relative
comfort
marina
is
used
to
indicate
a
municipal
or
commercially
operated
facility
where
a
pleasure
boat
may
dock
and
find
some
or
all
of
the
following
available
gasoline
fresh
water
electricity
telephone
service
ice
repair
facilities
restaurants
sleeping
accommodations
a
general
store
and
a
grocery
store
a
relatively
new
word
indicates
a
waterfront
type
of
hotel
where
a
yachtsman
may
dock
and
find
overnight
accommodations
on
the
premises
as
well
as
other
services
has
a
similar
meaning
to
yachtel
indicates
the
same
thing
but
it
is
meant
to
pertain
more
specifically
to
establishments
designed
to
cater
to
smaller
type
boats
such
as
outboards
of
nomenclature
yachtels
and
boatels
are
marinas
which
also
provide
some
of
the
above
facilities
may
rightfully
be
called
marinas
recent
survey
disclosed
there
are
about
commercially
and
municipally
operated
marinas
and
boatyards
in
the
the
majority
of
which
are
equipped
to
handle
outboard
boats
design
of
a
mechanical
interlocking
frame
is
much
like
a
mechanical
puzzle
but
once
understood
the
principles
can
be
applied
to
any
track
and
signal
arrangement
the
frame
are
two
sets
of
bars
which
interact
with
each
other
to
prevent
the
operator
from
making
dangerous
moves
main
set
of
bars
are
the
tappets
and
one
tappet
is
connected
to
each
lever
the
lever
is
pulled
to
clear
a
signal
or
move
a
switch
the
tappet
moves
a
short
distance
lengthwise
at
the
same
time
behind
the
plane
of
the
tappets
are
the
locking
bars
can
also
move
a
short
distance
but
at
right
angles
to
the
tappets
number
of
locking
bars
required
depends
on
how
many
false
moves
must
be
prevented
the
sides
of
the
tappets
are
notches
with
sloping
sides
and
connection
between
the
tappets
and
locking
bars
consist
of
cams
called
dogs
or
more
dogs
are
mounted
on
each
locking
bar
slide
into
and
out
of
the
notches
in
the
tappets
as
the
tappets
are
moved
locking
and
unlocking
them
how
the
scheme
works
the
operator
pulls
the
lever
to
clear
a
particular
signal
also
pulls
the
tappet
connected
to
the
particular
lever
and
forces
any
dogs
seated
in
the
notches
to
the
side
thus
moving
one
or
more
locking
bars
dogs
on
the
other
ends
of
these
locking
bars
are
thus
forced
into
notches
in
other
tappets
this
scheme
pulling
one
signal
to
clear
locks
all
the
other
switch
and
signal
levers
in
safe
positions
until
the
first
signal
is
again
restored
to
normal
signals
are
normally
at
stop
or
red
position
and
a
lever
must
be
pulled
to
clear
the
signal
is
not
necessarily
to
green
however
for
in
some
situations
only
a
yellow
indication
is
given
to
a
train
to
let
it
into
the
plant
are
other
basic
rules
turnout
may
have
two
levers
one
to
actually
move
the
switch
points
the
other
to
lock
the
points
signal
cannot
be
cleared
until
all
the
related
turnouts
are
properly
thrown
and
locked
locks
are
nearly
always
used
where
the
switch
points
face
oncoming
traffic
lock
insures
that
the
points
are
thrown
all
the
way
with
no
chance
that
a
wheel
flange
will
snag
on
a
partly
thrown
point
the
points
thrown
all
the
way
the
cannot
be
locked
and
in
turn
the
signal
cannot
be
cleared
these
locks
on
turnouts
are
called
facing
point
locks

typical
arrangements

that
actually
guide
the
wheels
off
the

if
a

are
used
in
many
instances
signals
have
two
blades
blades
indicate
a
fixed
aspect
the
blade
does
not
move
an
engineer
approaches
the

the
position
of
the
home
signal
is
seen
in
advance
when
he
passes
the
distant
signal
located
beyond
the
limits
of
the
interlocking
plant
some
situations
the
distant
signal
is
fixed
at
caution
other
instances
where
there
is
no
automatic

the
men

are
therefore
essential
to
any
scientific

rodding
is
a
science
not
a
science
as
involved
as
determining
what
makes
the
earth
rotate
on

but
it

that
a
hot

must
necessarily
be
a
mathematician
guy
can
be
an
active

successful
hot

for
years
without
becoming
even
remotely
involved
with

however
he
will
have
a

the
chances
are
he
will
be
more
successful
if
he
understands
the
few
formulas
that
apply
to
rodding
mathematical

is
nothing
more
than
a
pattern
for
solving
a
specific

places
the
various
factors
involved
in
the
problem
in
their
correct
order
in

to
each
other
so
that
the
influence
of
factors
on
each

can
be
computed
first
step
in
using
a
formula
is
to
insert
the
numerical
values
of
the

used
for
the
mathematical
process
of
solving
the
problem
for
rodding
formulas
are
not
complicated
involve
only
simple
mathematics
that
are
taught
in
grammar
school
arithmetic
classes
it
is
essential
that
the
various
mathematical
symbols
used
in
the

be
understood
so
that
the
mathematical

can
be
done

computed
by
comparing
the

manner
as
for

install
the

amount

compression
ratio
arrived
at
with
the
formula
will
be
the
same
regardless
of
whether
cubic
inches
or
cubic
centimeters
are
used
only
precaution
is
that
all
volumes
used
in
the
formula
be
quoted
in
the
same
terms
volume
of
the
cylinder
opening
in
the
head
gasket
must
be
computed
by
multiplying
its
area
in
square
inches
by
the
thickness
in
thousandths
of
an
inch
it
is
necessary
to
roughly
calculate
the
square

area
of
the
opening
but
the
calculation
can
usually
be
made
with
sufficient
accuracy
that
it
affect
the
final
computation
volume
of
the
opening
is
added
to
the
combustion
chamber
volume
thing
that
must
be
taken
into
consideration
is
the
volume
of
the
area
between
the
top
of
the
piston
and
the
top
of
the
cylinder
block
when
the
piston
is
in

this

by
measuring
the

from
the

of
the
block
to
the
piston
head
as
accurately
as
possible
with
a
depth
micrometer
or
some
other
precision
measuring
device
and
then
multiply
the
area
of
the
cylinder
by
the
depth
formula
for
this
step
is
volume
is
added
to
the
total
volume
of
the
combustion
chamber

opening
total
of
these
three
volumes

the
factors
just
described

they
are
applied
to
the
following
formula
an
example
dream
up
an
engine
that
has
a
final
combustion
chamber
volume
of
cubic

get
the

method
of
computing
compression
ratio
cannot
be
used
accurately
for
engines
that
have
pistons
with
either
domed
or
irregularly
shaped
heads
irregularity
on
the
piston
heads
will
make
it
impossible
with
normal
means
to
determine
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
because
the
volume
displaced
by
the
piston
heads
cannot
be
readily
computed
only
way
to
determine
the
final
combustion
chamber
volume
when
such
pistons
are
used
is
by
measuring
it
with

done
some

and
worked

did
it
with

are
two
good

on
the

side
and
is
more
the
compact
type
have
never
seen
off
his

he
seems
to
know
nothing

trot
and
keeps
trying
a
little
harder
if
asked
to
do
so
has
made
a

several

has
thrived
on

is
a
wonderful

and
another
good

with
solid
rugged

good
flat

and
excellent

colt
arrived
at
the
early
last
and
immediately
was
put
into
harness
and
for
a
few
days
and
then
put
to
cart
and
broken
in
very
nicely
knowing
nothing
but
trot
appeared
in
the
hopples
about
was
treated
for
worms
on
the
the

has
done
everything
asked

it
with

another
promising
colt

of
the
ever
at

he
was
harnessed
he
stood

he
walked
off
like

blistered
for

has
delayed
his

somewhat
up

he
has
shown
as
much
as
any
in
the
big
stable
is
a
playful
bay
rascal
of
a
colt
not
the
best
gaited
but
he
surely
can
pace
and
is
right
there
with
them
and
sometimes
leading
them
in
the

colt
knows
nothing

pace
and
has
been
right
there
in
the
best
miles
is
not
so
masculine
as
most
of
the
colts
but
like
his
type
and
he
certainly
is
one
of
the
pacers
on
the
grounds
for
curbs
and
laid
off
three
weeks
he
is
coming
along
fine
and
looks
like
a
pacer
to
me
looks
like
a
splendid
candidate
for
the
best
time
is
colts
in
stable
have
little
if
anything
on
the
fillies
especially
the
pacers
is
improving
with
each
and
paced
weeks
ago
shows
promise
and
does
it
in
good
form
and
her
best
time
is
about
a
filly
that
wanted
to
trot
knocked
herself
and
fighting
the
hopples
was
then
trained
on
the
trot
until
hitched
to
a
breaking
cart
once
around
the
track
and
hoppled
again
time
she
submitted
and
in
a
few
days
was
going
good
she
paced
a
mile
in
on
on
filly
is
a
much
better
individual
than
either
of
her
and
more
scale
and
much
better
underpinning
is
more
like
her
full
brother
but
larger
to
date
she
is
a
filly
has
four
promising
pacers
seems
to
be
the
pick
of
the
stable
at
the
present
time
is
a
colt
with
a
good
body
good
set
of
legs
and
nice
way
of
going
best
mile
to

is
comes
next
with
a
mile
in
colt
is
another
equine
is
a
little
on
the
small
side
but
a
very
compact
colt
and
looks
like
one
to
stand
training
and
many
future
battles
with
colts
in
his
class
time
to
date
is
has
worked
in
on
the
track
and
shows
promise
of
have
worked
from
to
has
gone
in
in
first
time
saw
the
latter
filly
she
trotted
by
me
and
noticed
such
a
family
resemblance
that
said
to
myself
that
must
be
is
a
beautiful
filly
and
likes
to
trot
has
gone
in
around
is
a
large
colt
who
has
been
unfortunate
to
be
laid
off
for
some
time
due
to
injuries
is
going
sound
again
now
and
looks
good
has
gone
in
is
one
of
the
favorites
in
the
stable
and
the
boys
like
her
very
much
will
be
able
to
tell
you
more
about
this
string
of
equines
in
the
near
future
have
just
seen
and
work
a
mile
in
last
quarter
in
going
away
got
behind
several
lengths
stalling
at
the
start
she
is
a
little
fussy
left
the
together
and
finished
almost
together
shows
class
filly
is
another
that
wants
to
trot
and
trot
she
did
until
forced
to
do
otherwise
well
broken
and
equipped
with
shoes
on
behind
in
front
she
would
trot
a
real
storm
with
the
master
driving
placed
in
the
hopples
she
was
completely
baffled
hesitated
she
hopped
she
rolled
and
rocked
skipped
and
jumped
but
in
some
two
weeks
she
started
to
pace
that
time
to
this
she
has
shown
steady
improvement
and
now
looks
like
one
of
the
classiest
things

but
not
easy
to
decide
on
a
new
one
still
have
time
to
drop
a
few
hints
about
the
gifts
appreciate
most
the
time
to
decide
on
them
is
now
a
service
taken
a
close
look
at
this
crop
of
new
models
they
are
with
my
comments
and
judgments
on
take
your
pick
and
start
dropping
those
hints
on
my
own
list
would
be
two
arms
a
rifle
and
a
handgun
that
qualify
as
new
in
the
strictest
sense
me
a
changed
barrel
length
or
an
improved
stock
constitute
a
truly
new
design
modifications
are
all
for
the
best
but
it
takes
something
as
different
as
a
or
a
to
change
concepts
under
is
a
new
rifle
action
in
a
caliber
that
upsets
all
the
modern
theory
of
fans
a
short
light
little
timber
gun
designed
to
push
a
heavy
slug
at
modest
velocity
but
with
lots
of
killing
power
and
ample
range
for
our
most
popular
big
game
whitetail
reports
that
on
his
recent
safari
the
little
cartridge
was
a
real
work
horse
antelope
were
generally
grassed
with
one
shot
and
the
carbine
also
bagged
reedbuck
kob
and
wart
hog
with
deadly
efficiency
these
are
fairly
large
tough
animals
deadliness
of
the
in
a
rifle
comes
as
no
surprise
to
me
least
five
years
ago
of
made
up
an
double
rifle
for
me
in
this
caliber
using
the
now
defunct
action
in
size
figuring
out
how
to
regulate
the
barrels
so
that
they
shot
to
the
same
point
of
impact
we
fired
this
little
job
on
my
home
range
and
in
underground
test
gallery
quickly
ran
into
the
same
trouble
that
plagued
in
his
first
experiments
or
four
bullets
would
be
placed
well
in
a
bull
at
yards
and
then
unaccountably
one
could
stray
far
out
of
the
group
learned
that
this
was
because
the
higher
velocity
achieved
in
a
long
barrel
was
upsetting
the
shape
of
the
unjacketed
revolver
bullet
new
jacketed
slug
in
corrected
this
even
without
jacketed
bullets
had
enough
faith
in
my
double
to
take
it
on
an
deer
hunt
that
first
year
half
an
hour
jumped
a
buck
that
through
a
rhododendron
thicket
and
caught
him
just
behind
the
left
foreleg
at
yards
moved
only
about
feet
after
the
slug
hit
him
and
this
was
after
the
bullet
had
passed
through
a
sapling
more
deer
have
fallen
to
this
same
gun
and
all
were
kills
double
was
made
with
revolver
barrels
before
cutting
to
revolver
length
and
although
it
compares
well
in
other
respects
considerably
heavier
than
the
which
only
scales
about
pounds
ever
a
rifle
met
the
needs
of
the
whitetail
hunter
this
is
it
points
with
the
ease
speed
and
precision
of
a
fine
imported
double
shotgun
and
its
trigger
pull
is
light
and
sharp
bullet
leaves
the
muzzle
at
fps
which
gives
it
all
the
smash
needed
at
woods
ranges
five
shots
at
the
immediate
command
of
the
trigger
finger
the
gun
and
load
are
a
deadly
combination
second
really
new
development
this
year
was
a
revolver
handling
a
different
sort
of
varmint
load
the
present
available
in
one
model
the
fine
and
familiar
revolver
about
long
a
handgun
among
target
arms
velocity
of
this
bullet
is
rated
at
a
very
hot
fps
and
the
flattest
shooting
of
any
revolver
cartridge
with
a
rise
of
about
an
inch
over
a
range
is
a
varmint
load
pure
and
simple
much
too
explosive
for
small
edible
game
can
cut
a
red
squirrel
neatly
in
two
or
burst
a
crow
into
a
flurry
of
feathers
most
intriguing
aspect
of
the
chambered
for
the
new
is
that
it
can
also
fire
standard
by
means
of
adapter
sleeves
in
the
chambers
may
therefore
convert
the
gun
into
a
and
plinking
arm
although
the
difference
in
the
point
of
impact
can
be
somewhat
disconcerting
accuracy
of
the
cartridge
is
fine
tested
it
in
my
scoped
and
it
was
good
enough
to
allow
me
to
hit
a
chuck
with
every
shot
at
yards
if
did
my
part
by
holding
the
handgun
steadily
rifles
fact
that
the
and
the
were
the
only
completely
new
designs
this
year
mean
that
see
changes
in
models
actions
and
calibers
from
the
carbine
a
number
of
hunting
rifles
have
been
introduced
for
the
first
time
are
the
brands
in
alphabetical
order
and
the
new
models
to
the
hunter
are
the
group
of
rifles
have
fine
actions
and
a
finish
on
both
the
metal
and
the
stock
wood
weights
vary
sensibly
with
the
various
calibers
available
and
these
include
the
standard
bores
about
plus
the
around
the
latter
include
the
and
rubber
recoil
pads
are
standard
on
all
of
the
except
the
designs
are
excellent
for
use
with
scopes
rifles
are
all
made
with
actions
regardless
of
caliber
have
the
short
action
the
and
the
medium

the

the
the
long
action
about

the
version

lone
newcomer

the

given
this

an
exceptionally
fine

the

the

made
two
contributions
to
the
harvest
of
new
offerings

a

the

an
even
newer
auto
this
one
with
a

the
outfit
has
appeared
but
this
time
as
a
combination
bore
is
unrifled
but
is
provided
with
an
insert
tube
which
is
rifled
and
which
surprisingly
gives
pretty
fair
accuracy
even
though
only
inches
long
can
unscrew
this
tube
and
replace
it
with
a
smoothbore
insert
for
use
with
shotshells

your
choice
of

the

a
good
outfit

inspired
by
the
popularity

beat

safety
catch
will
make
this

more
appealing

the

fresh
crop
of
guns
showed
up
in
and
good
bets
for
your
gift
list
if
wondering
what
to
get
for
a
youngster
most
unusual
of
them
is
the
about
for
a
saddle
scabbard
a
patterned
after
the
famous
and
featuring
the
look
of
its
traditional
lines
it
probably
has
more
kid
appeal
than
any
other
model
action
is
a
handling
all
the
standard
latest
is
also
designed
for
the
beginning
shooter
although
a
rifle
with
plenty
of
barrel
weight
and
ample
stock
is
the
about
a
with
an
automatic
safety
the
safety
goes
on
every
time
the
bolt
is
lifted
and
the
gun
cocked
for
the
next
shot
design
is
excellent
and
this
model
is
a
good
first
gun
model
is
the
around
which
comes
with
a
barrel
and
a
short
stock
just
right
for
a
boy
of
shotgun
has
also
been
introduced
this
year
under
is
made
with
a
side
lever
rather
than
a
lever
because
many
youngsters
strong
enough
to
operate
a
top
tang
to
open
a
gun
and
the
side
lever
does
indeed
open
very
easily
gun
has
a
stock
and
is
available
in
either
or
gauge
another
addition
to
the
line
the
in
under
which
you
may
or
may
not
consider
a
gun
many
experienced
hunters
like
this
gauge
and
type
of
scattergun
too
there
were
no
startling
developments
in
shotgun
design
this
year
a
number
of
new
models
and
variations
of
existing
models
did
hit
the
market
example
a
trap
version
of
the
the
from
up
depending
on
grade
differs
from
standard
models
in
that
it
is
equipped
with
a
full
beavertail
fore
end
a
cushion
recoil
pad
and
a
ventilated
rib
for
fast
sighting
line
now
includes
a
new
scattergun
the
or
about
and
respectively
in
and
has
introduced
another
import
this
one
from
the
about
a
very
much
like
the
old
which
was
so
fine
a
gun
that
today
a
used
one
still
brings
high
prices
has
also
added
two
models
to
its
line
prices
begin
at
less
than

depend
on
grade
and
optional
features
is
a
auto
beginning
at
just
over

very
good

latest
contribution
to
the
field
is
the
from
this

an
improved
version
of
the
old
a

page
for
a
complete
report
on
it

the

driving

he
drove
his

the
classic

the
most
fashionable

on
this
stretch
was
made
up
largely
of

most
of
them

trenchermen

not
complain
at
the
inhuman
hour
of

all
that
remains

that
once
rivalled
the
of
my
steps
to
the
of
only
one
with
six
minarets
entered
the
courtyard
with
a
gallery
supported
by
pointed
arches
running
around
it
and
a
fountain
in
the
middle
of
the
most
beautiful
buildings
in
it
was
constructed
in
the
early
years
of
the
with
a
huge
central
dome
two
half
domes
that

stop
and
rode
up
the

any

will
do
past
the
of
also
known
as
the
at
the
top
on
my

stands
in
the
middle
of
what
was
once
the
of
who
brought
it
from
stayed
on
the

for
a
few
minutes
until
turning
right
it
entered
a
huge
square
with
the
on

and
the
gate
to
the
university
just
beyond
it
got
off
crossed
the
square
and
on
the
side
directly
opposite
the

found
a
good
restaurant
hard
to
come
by
in
this
part
of
the
city
the
it
is
on
the
third
floor
with
signs
pointing
the

has
a
terrace
overlooking
the

just
before
reaching

a
pastry
shop
that
sells
some
of
the
best
baklava

sweet
flaky
cake
in
a
great
favorite
of
the
university

and
joined
them
there
for

the
streetcar
back
to
walked
ahead
then
left
down
the
street
opposite
and
just
beyond
the
corner
came
to
a
small
building
with
a
roof
which
is
the
entrance
to
the
an
underground
cistern
its
roof
supported
by
rows
and
rows
of
pillars

was
built
by

and
emerged
almost
immediately

past
the
entrance
to
turned
left
at
the
end
of
it
and
continued
toward
a
gate
in
the
wall
ahead
before
reaching
it
came
to
a
grey
and
brown
stone
building
that
looks
somewhat
like
an
pagoda
with
lettering
in
gold

distance
past
the

then
just
outside
the

saw
a
spring
with
a
tap
in
the

on
my
right
the
where
he
washed
his
hands
and
his
sword
after
beheading
his
victims
through

with
towers
on
either
side
once
used
as
prisons
entered
a
huge
square
surrounded
by
buildings
and
on
the
wall
to
my
right
found
a
general
plan
of
the

is
laminated
from
four
pieces
two

rip
them
down
the

ones
are
a
narrower
battens
are
carefully
fastened
in
place
after
some
necessary
fairing
on
all
frames
and
screws
are
used
is
important
because
the
rear
seat
bunks
and
front
jump
seats
rest
on
or
are
fastened
to
many
of
the
side
battens
the
exception
of
two
battens
all
run
to
the
stem
where
they
are
glued
and
screwed
after
careful
beveling
chines
go
in
the

way
except
that
they
are
made
of
two
pieces
of
wood
for
strength
and
easier
bending
is
always
a
tedious
job
but
the
work
can
be
cut
down
considerably
with
a
planer
and
a
simple
jig
clamped
a
piece
of
aluminum
to
the
base
of
the
planer
with
a
pair
of
aluminum
flush
against
the
battens
acted
as
a
fairing
stick
and
enabled
me
to
plane
the
chines
and
keelson
to
the
proper
bevels
easily
you
own
a
planer
and
want
to
buy
one
well
worth
renting
planking
is
plywood
can
be
obtained
in
widths
feet
long
width
leaves
very
little
waste
pieces
are
used
the
sides
first
using
glue
and
nails
at
all
battens
the
stem
and
the
transom
person
inside
with
a
weight
against
each
batten
will
help
in
the
fastening
best
procedure
is
to
have
a
few
friends
hold
the
planking
in
place
while
you
mark
it
off
trim
the
excess
used
a
made
by
for
this
job
good
for
cutting
all
the
planking
because
it
cuts
with
a
blade
at
high
rpm
and
does
not
chatter
the
plywood
like
a
saber
saw
cut
the
planking
is
clamped
in
place
for
a
final
and
careful
trimming
it
is
marked
on
the
inside
where
it
comes
in
contact
with
the
transom
frames
keelson
and
all
the
battens
may
then
be
for
the
fastenings
next
step
is
to
remove
it
and
spread
glue
where
it
has
been
marked
at
the
contact
points
it
is
replaced
and
fastened
bottom
planking
is
applied
in
the
same
manner
planking
the
bottom
gets
a
layer
of
spray
rails
are
first
glued
on
the
outside
and
fastened
from
the
inside
with
screws
the

are
rounded
off
and
the

is
in
preparation
the

are
also
covered
up
to
the
spray
rails
they
are
also
in
that
area
cloth
is
laid
on
one
half
of
the
bottom
at
a
time
width
is
used
on
each
side
and
it
laps
the
keel
line
by
about
three
inches
the
cloth
in
place
and
trim
it
to
size
remove
it
and
give
the
whole
bottom
a
coat
of
resin
the
resin
has
hardened
mix
up
another
batch
with
a
pigment
added
if
you
wish
used
bright
red
mixing
the
pigment
in
thoroughly
before
adding
the
hardener
a
cheap
brush
coat
one
side
of
the
bottom
with
the
resin
and
then
apply
the
cloth
the
cloth
is
smooth
apply
another
coat
of
resin
spreading
it
with
a
paint
roller
sure
it
is
well
saturated
and
then
allow
it
to
harden
the
whole
bottom
has
hardened
use
a
disk
sander
to
feather
the
edges
of
the
cloth
at
the
keel
line
and
near
the
spray
rail
lay
a
strip
of

you
can
build
most
of
it
in
your
own

in
your
spare
time

panelized
and
utilizes
standard
materials
and
requires
the
use
of
only
simple
tools
the
following
pages
and
in
the
following
issues
we
take
you
every
step
of
the
way
to
your
vacation
cottage
from
choosing
the
proper
site
to
applying
the
final
trim
recognition
of
the
growing
trend
for
second
homes
or
vacation
cottages
we
have
designed
this
one
specifically
with
the
family
handyman
in
mind
is
a
big
project
not
to
be
taken
lightly
each
step
has
been
broken
down
into
easy
stages
utilizing
standard
materials
and
simple
tools
well
within
the
capabilities
of
the
handyman
theory
idea
behind
our
design
is
modular
units
or
panelization
possible
has
been
scaled
to
standard
sizes
and
measurements
of
materials
panels
and
structural
timbers
are
standard
as
are
windows
and
doors
making
for
a
minimum
of
cutting
have
developed
an
ingenious
method
of
interlocking
these
so
that
you
can
make
the
major
part
of
your
house
in
your
own
workshop
panel
by

according
to
plan
when
you
have
prepared
your
foundation
and
laid
the

these
can
be
trucked
to
the
site
and
erected
with
a
small
crew
of
friends
in
a
weekend
roof
timbers
are
precut
and
the
panels
standard
so
that
the
house
can
be
completely
enclosed
in
a
matter
of
three
or
four
days
you
can
do
the
finishing
touches
at
your
leisure
warning
to
the
fact
that
building
codes
and
regulations
vary
so
much
throughout
the
country
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
find
out
what
if
any
they
are
to
a
large
city
they
might
even
specify
the
size
of
the
nails
used
in
a
remote
section
there
might
be
no
restrictions
at
all
can
usually
be
found
out
at
the
nearest
town
hall
the
same
time
check
the
electrical
plumbing
and
sanitary
requirements
as
well
as
possible
zoning
regulations
electricity
and
public
water
and
sewers
are
available
or
not
check
the
local
customs
in
the
use
of
bottled
or
gas
we
give
you
alternatives
later
on
sure
that
this
information
is
reasonably
official
and
not
just
an
unfounded
opinion
there
are
any
major
restrictions
they
usually
can
be
obtained
in
printed
form
a
building
permit
is
required
find
out
what
you
must
present
when
applying
for
one
many
cases
you
must
file
a
complete
set
of
plans
with
the
local

to
look
for
in

if
you
already
bought

and
how
will
they

visit
in
the
early
spring
after
a

will
be
very
informative
where
the
sun
rises
and
sets
and
ask
which
direction

come
from

something
you
can
live
with
worry
too
much
about

we
will
take
up

down
a
power
source
and
a
movable

tension
may
be
adjusted
to
suit
individual
requirements
by
gripping
the
spring
housing
with
a

from
unwinding
when
it
is
released
loosening
the

the
desired
tension
is
achieved
the

it
lose
the
chuck
key
manufacturers
have
had
the
foresight
to
provide
a
socket
for
the
chuck
key
otherwise
have
to
spend
a
few
minutes
to
either
attach
a
suitable
spring
clip
somewhere
on
the
press
head
or
fit
the
key
to
a
length
of
light
chain
and
fasten
to
the
bottom
of
the
motor
mount
so
that
the
key
is
out
of
the
way
when
not
in
use
and
speeds
speeds
are
important
if
you
want
a
good
job
cutting
tool
will
operate
best
at
a
given
speed
depending
on
the
material
worked
most
drill
presses
it
is
impossible
to
get
the
exact
speed
but
you
can
come
close
by
adjusting
the
drive
belt
on
the
pulleys
will
find
a
chart
giving
the
various
speed
ratios
available
with
your
particular
drill
press
somewhere
in
the
instruction
booklet
that
came
with
the
tool
the
table
on
page
for
exact
recommended
speeds
the
larger
the
tool
and
the
harder
the
material
the
slower
the
speed
pressure
is
also
of
major
importance
much
pressure
will
force
the
tool
beyond
its
cutting
capacity
and
result
in
rough
cuts
and
jammed
or
broken
tools
light
a
feed
particularly
with
metal
or
other
hard
material
causes
overheating
of
the
tool
and
burning
of
the
cutting
edge
best
results
will
be
obtained
by
matching
the
correct
speed
with
a
steady
feed
pressure
that
lets
the
tool
cut
easily
at
an
even
rate
drilling
tools
are
numerous
types
and
styles
of
tools
to
drill
holes
most
common
are
the
twist
drill
the
solid
center
shaft
with
interchangeable
cutting
blades
the
double
spur
bit
and
the
power
wood
bit
will
do
a
good
job
if
sharp
but
the
twist
drills
cut
quite
as
smoothly
as
the
others
since
they
do
not
have
the
outlining
spurs
that
sever
the
fibers
before
actual
boring
starts
adjustable
fly
cutter
is
very
useful
for
cutting
large
diameter

of

to

drill

drill

turn
the

there
is
sometimes
a

for

to
wander
due
to
the
varying

of

this
case
drilling
a
small

will
do
much
to

to

the

and
finally
opposed

in

of
many
objections
the
granted
a
charter
on
of
that
year
the
bridge
was
completed
and
opened
who
invented
and
later
patented
the
arch
type
of
construction
for
wooden
bridges
was
the
genius
who
planned
and
supervised
the
building
of
the

bridge
although
the
actual
work
was
carried
out
under
the
direction
of
who
received
as
recompense
bridge
is
best
described
by
president
of
in
his
published
in
in
says
of
it
consists
of
two
divisions
separated
by
an
island
at
a
small
distance
from
the
southern
shore
division
between
the
island
and
this
shore
consists
principally
of
an
arch
whose
chord
is
one
hundred
and
sixty
feet
and
whose
vortex
is
forty
feet
it
was
actually
feet
above
the
mark
appearance
and
construction
it
resembles
the
bridge
whole
length
of

is
one
thousand
and
thirty
feet
and
its
breadth
have
already
mentioned
that
of
was
the
inventor
of
the
arched
bridges
in
this
country
was
educated
to
only
and
had
never
seen
a
structure
of
this
nature
he
certainly
deserves
not
a
little
credit
for
the
invention
is
hardly
necessary
to
remind
students
of
covered
bridges
that
was
born
in
in
nearby
that
he
moved
with
his
parents
to
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
and
was
there
apprenticed
to
a
builder
and
architect
was
indeed
a
remarkable
feat
that
a
man
who
had
had
no
experience
of
bridge
building
should
have
applied
the
principle
of
the
arch
which
appears
in
his
famous
bridges
at
and
when
first
built
was
not
covered
far
as
we
know
no
bridge
had
been
thus
protected
in
is
the
authority
for
the
statement
that
the
northern
section
was
probably
roofed
by
original
appearance
is
shown
in
an
engraving
published
in
the
in
which
is
reproduced
herewith
brief
description
accompanying
the
picture
says
that
the
bridge
contained
more
than
tons
of
timber
the
abutments
on
the
shore
and
the
south
bank
of
there
was
one
span
or
arch
measuring
feet
between
the
north
shore
of
and
the
side
there
was
an
arch
of
feet
and
a
series
of
piers

a
draw
forty
feet
long
dinner
and
celebration
in
honor
of
this
piece
of
engineering
took
place
in
a
tavern
erected
by
the
corporation
on
the
island
is
said
that
the
eccentric
who
was
one
of
the
first
stood
on
the
table
and
made
a
speech
worthy
of
the
occasion
says
that
he
delivered
an
oration
on
the
bridge
which
for
elegance
of
style
propriety
of
speech
or
force
of
argument
was
truly
reporter
must
have
written
this
with
tongue
in
cheek
because
oration
could
hardly
be
understood
and
although
he
later
explained
that
he
was
talking
it
seems
rather
more
likely
that
he
had
succumbed
to
the
joys
of
the
evening
north
portion
of
the
bridge
was
well
worth
the
cost
of
construction
although
it
proved
to
be
twice

was
estimated

the
beginning

in
its
original
form

however
on
account
of
its

by

torn
down

appropriately
the

engagement
of
the

is
a
good
eight
years
now
since
each
of
us
acquired
a
swimming
pool
eight
enlightening
vigorous
rigorous
not
wholly
unrewarding
years
have
learned
a
lot
a
dash
of
hydrochemistry
here
a
bit
about
plumbing
and
there
have
had
sound
grounding
in
the
principles
of
the
school
of
diplomacy
have
become
amateur
insurance
experts
and
yard
birds
our
problems
have
lessened
a
bit
as
more
and
more
of
our
neighbors
have
built
their
own
pools
thereby
diluting
our
spectacular
attractions
problems
cling
to

as
any

our
innate

us
to
share
our
trials

solutions
with
any
who
are
taking

for
the
first
time
in
the
pious
hope
that
some
may
profit
from
our
experience
to
put
it
may
not
be
everything
but
in
the
case
of
a
pool
it
can
certainly
contribute
difficulties
social

from
varying
viewpoints
of
us

a
pool
set
in
a

very
near
the
house

has
his
pool
far
away
from

in
a
field
high
on

are
dreaming
of
a
blue
shimmering
pool
right
outside
your
living
room
windows
close
your
eyes
firmly
and
fill
in
the

with
lots
and
lots
of
children
damp
towels
squashed
tubes
of
suntan
oil
and
plastic
toys
are
likely
to
be
nearer
the
truth
can
also
see
that
the
greater
the
proximity
of
the
pool
to
your
main
living
quarters
the
greater
the
chance
for
violation
of
family
privacy
annoying
noise
and
the
attitude
the
other
hand
does
not
lead
to
when
children
cannot
be
easily
observed
and
you
have
to
make
a
long
trek
to
reach
the
pool
dilemma
picturesque
as
a
sylvan
pond
in
the
forest
may
be
trees
offer
a
leaf
and
root
hazard
to
the
of
a
pool
a
grassy
approach
can
turn
a
pool
into
a
floating
lawn
every
time
the
grass
is
mowed
in
choosing
a
wife
it
is
only
sensible
to
consider
also
how
appealing
a
pool
is
likely
to
be
in
bad
weather
as
well
as
in
good
the
colder
climes
for
instance
you
will
have
to
live
through
the
many
unglamorous
winter
months
when
your
pool
will
hardly
look
its
best
may
be
a
big
hole
in
the
ground
filled
with
salt
hay
or
an
ice
floe
studded
with
logs
a
neat
plunge
is
not
exactly
a
joy
to
behold
do
however
recommend
those
patented
covers
to
prevent
both
people
and
junk
flora
and
fauna
generally
from
accidentally
wintering
in
the
pool
no
location
for
a
pool
is
perfect
on
all
counts
it
will
be
dictated
to
a
large
extent
by
the
shape
and
size
of
your
land
if
space
and
money
are
no
problem
and
small
children
are
not
on
hand
every
day
it
is
certainly
more
restful
to
have
your
pool
and
entertainment
area
removed
from
the
immediate
environs
of
the
house
a
good
several
feet
around
the
pool
should
be
neither
greensward
nor
woods
but
good
hard
pavement
placement
of
your
pool
however
will
not
of
itself
solve
the
two
major
problems
of
pool
owning
those
that
involve
your
social
life
and
those
pertaining
to
safety
with
them
demands
stern
discipline
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
family
neighbors
friends
and
anyone
you
ever
talked
to
on
a
transoceanic
jet
years
ago
while
we
were
going
through
the
construction
period
we
were
each
solaced
by
the
vision
of
early
morning
dips
and

to
a
cool
family
collected
around
the
pool
with
a
buffet
table
laid
out
nearby
for
the
lord
and
delectation
not
even
our
first
gatherings

anywhere

proud
to
perpetual
hosts
and
handymen
was
a
short
step
no
more
than
the
change
from
city
clothes
to
trunks
of
us
maybe
but
the
results
of
our
impulsive
invitations
to
come
over
next
summer
and
swim
in
our
new
pool
were
both
unexpected
and
unsettling
book
of
etiquette
the
first
few
weeks
it
was
obvious
that
rules
had
to
be
made
laid
down
and
obeyed
even
if
our
popularity

became
subnormal
as
a
result

we
made
in
unabashed
collusion
our
viewpoints
in
this
respect
coincided
precisely
we
present
the
fruits
of
our
efforts
herewith
as
a
single
social
code
for

owners

allowed
to
issue
blanket
invitations
to
his

of

we
finally
managed
to
coerce
our
children
to
this
view
friends
and
ours
are
welcome
to
share
the
pool
but
on
our
terms
and
at
our
times

are
to
arrive
without
an
invitation
or
without
at

telephoning

you

we
earnestly
recommend
for

a
good

with
your

lawsuits

are
the
result
of

with
the

you
want
to
make
your

a

widow
and
to
spend
a
great
many
of
your
leisure
hours
nursing
your
pristine
purity
its
care
and
feeding
from

to
filtering
and
vacuuming
is
best
left
to
a
weekly
or
professional
service
course
if
your
pool
is
close
to
the
house
your
wife
can
always
add
it
to
her
housekeeping
chores
you
hope
you
can
make
pool
care
the

of
swimming
for
so
every
pool
owner
in
case
of

should
have
some
idea
of
what

from
the

builders
may
well
be
appreciated
in
a

will
turn
your

poison
green
overnight
need
more
chlorine
walls
feel
slippery
need
algaecide
or
without
professional
help
you
will
have
to
be
able
to
do
some
of
these
jobs
yourself
unless
you
have
a

nurse
should
see
to
it
that

of

not

this
possibility
your

is
located
on

near
sloping
ground
it
may
have
natural
drainage
which
is
certainly
more
desirable
than
to
be
faced
with
the
annual
expense
and
labor
of
first
pumping
out
the

and
then
scooping
out
all
the

may
be
true
that
pool
lighting
dramatizes
an
evening
scene
but
lights
also
attract
all
the
insect
life
for
miles
around
on
the

these
little
visitors
seldom
leave
and
this
adds
to
your
filtering

problems
as
well
as
providing
a
slapping

for
all
those

one

high

will
provide
all
the

experience
has
taught
us
that
it
pays
to
buy
the
best
equipment
possible
from
pipes
to
brushes
instructions
to
the
letter
and
be
sure
that
one
person
in
the

or
not
is
regularly
responsible
for
each

of
the

with
no

it
is
the
which
has
arrived
at
this
conclusion

that

come
a
long

from
the
early

the

they
inflicted
know
now
that
a

assure
the

no

is
when

the

this
can
mean
savings
both
in

you
see
your

clear
to

your

the
problems
of
combining

are
knotty
it
may
be
cheaper
to

pump
of
the
more
remarkable
of
the
new
cooling
systems
is
one
that
can
be
switched
to

you
know
a
conditioner
makes
indoor
air
cool
by
pumping
the
heat
out
of
it
and
then
releasing
this
heat
outdoors
relatively
simple
switching
arrangement
reverses
the
cycle
so
that
the
machine
literally
runs
backward
and
the
heat
is
extracted
from
outdoor
air
and
turned
indoors
until
recently
this
heat
pump
method
of
warming
air
was
efficient
only
in
areas
of
mild
winters
and
when
outside
temperatures
were
above
degrees
the
machine
has
been
improved
to
a
point
where
it
is
generally
more
economical
than
oil
heat
at
temperatures
down
to

can
get
this
added

feature
for
as
little
as

than
the

besides
the
nature
of
your

and
how

it
will
depend
upon
your
personal

of

determine
how

safest
procedure
is
to
let
your
builder
estimate
the
size
of
the
unit
you
need
rather
than
trying
to
do
this
yourself
urge
your
builder
to
give
you
a
little
extra
cooling

just
to
be
sure
you

selection
must
know
before
you
start
what
the
needs
and
objectives
of
your
organization
are
you
must
have
a
list
of
requirements
on
where
how
many
and
what
type
sites
are
needed
such
a
program
you
can
make
constructive
selections
of
the
best
sites
available
the
examination
of
a
site
with
a
good
map
and
aerial
photos
if
possible
are
becoming
more
and
more
available
through
the
work
of
counties
and
other
government
agencies
new
editions
of
topographic
maps
being
made
by
the
federal
government
are
excellent
for
orienting
yourself
to
the
natural
features
of
the
site
are
inexpensive
and
available
from
the
recent
years
many
counties
and
the
have
taken
aerial
photos
which
show
features
in
detail
and
are
very
good
for
planning
use
counties
also
have
maps
available
from
the
county
engineer
showing
roads
and
other
features
and
from
the
office
showing
ownerships
of
land
the
site
in
the
field
during
the
time
of
the
year
when
the
area
will
be
most
heavily
used
for
recreation
gives
you
a
better
opportunity
to
get
the
feel
of
the
climate
conditions
the
exposure
to
the
sun
and
wind
the
water
interests
etcetera
which
vary
greatly
with
the
seasons
is
usually
helpful
to
make
a
sketch
map
in
the
field
showing
the
size
and
location
of
the
features
of
interest
and
to
take
photographs
at
the
site
are
a
great
aid
for
planning
use
back
at
the
office
site
planning
work
it
is
best
to
have
a
qualified
and
experienced
park
planner
to
carry
through
the
study
there
is
also
much
to
be
gained
by
making
use
of
the
abilities
of
the
local
people
who
are
available
and
interested
in
recreation
judges
commissioners
engineers
assessors
and
others
who
have
lived
in
the
area
for
a
long
time
may
have
valuable
knowledge
regarding
the
site
or
opinions
to
offer
from
their
varied
professional
experiences
visit
to
the
site
by
a
group
of
several
persons
can
usually
bring
out
new
ideas
or
verify
opinions
most
helpful
to
the
planning
study
of
any
recreation
area
much
study
is
required
of
course
depends
on
the
character
of
the
site
itself
the
previous
experience
of
the
investigator
and
the
number
of
factors
needed
to
arrive
at
a
good
decision
is
too
easy
for
the
inexperienced
person
to
make
a
quick
judgment
of
a
few
values
of
the
area
and
base
a
decision
on
these
alone
there
are
more
factors
to
good
site
planning
than
first
impressions
site
may
be
a
rundown
slum
or
a
desolate
piece
of
desert
in
appearance
today
but
have
excellent
potentials
for
the
future
with
a
little
development
or
water
same
is
true
of
areas
which
at
first
look
good
because
of
a
few
existing
recreation
features
but
may
actually
be
poor
areas
to
develop
for
general
public
use
looking
for
the
best
sites
available
that
meet
the
requirements
you
need
information
to
compare
the
site
with
others
need
answers
to
four
important
questions
are
the
existing
recreation
features
well
can
the
site
be
developed
useful
will
it
be
to
the
public
this
site
available
the
quantity
and
quality
of
all
of
the
recreation
interests
already
existing
at
the
site
a
park
site
with
scenic
views
a
good
lake
trees
and
sand
dunes
will
attract
more
people
than
a
nearby
area
with
only
trees
and
dunes
is
vitally
important
on
a
body
of
clear
clean
water
will
be
vastly
different
from
the
same
amount
of
frontage
on
polluted
water
recreation
features
such
as
scenic
values
and
water
interest
also
have
greater
overall
value
than
other
interests
of
the
most
desirable
features
for
a
park
are
beautiful
views
or
scenery
may
be
distant
views
of
a
valley
or
the
mountains
or
natural
features
such
as
a
small
lake
colorful
rock
formations
or
unusual
trees
site
which
overlooks
a
harbor
or
river
may
offer
interest
in
the
activities
of
boating
traffic
area
on
the
coast
may
have
relaxing
views
of
the
surf
rolling
in
on
a
beach
site
may
also
be
attractive
just
through
the
beauty
of
its
trees
and
shrubs
extent
of
these
interests
and
how
available
they
will
be
for
the
public
to
enjoy
interest
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
factors
you
can
find
for
a
recreation
site
park
planners
look
to
water
frontage
for
basic
park
areas
follows
naturally
since
frontage
on
an
ocean
stream
or
lake
provides
scenic
values
and
opportunities
for
the
very
popular
recreation
activities
of
bathing
fishing
boating
and
other
water
sports
body
of
water
is
usually
the
center
of
interest
at
parks
which
attract
the
greatest
picnic
and
camping
use
also
cools
the
air
in
summer
and
nourishes
the
trees
and
wild
life
amount
of
water
frontage
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
water
and
the
recreation
afforded
by
it
are
important
restricted
frontage
may
be
too
crowded
an
area
for
public
use
quantity
of
water
flow
may
be
critical
a
stream
or
pond
which
is
attractive
in
the
springtime
may
become
stagnant
or
dry
in
late
summer
the
site
is
on
a
reservoir
the
level
of
the
water
at
various
seasons
as
it
affects
recreation
should
be
studied
the
quality
of
the
water
stream
which
has
all
of
its
watershed
within
a
national
forest
or
other
lands
under
good
conservation
practices
is
less
likely
to
be
affected
by
pollution
than
one
passing
through
unrestricted
logging
or
past
an
industrial
area
factors
such
as
water
temperature
depth
of
water
the
fish
life
it
supports
wave
action
flooding
etcetera
will
affect
its
recreation
value
natural
features
which
can
be
of
high
interest
are
the
forests
canyons
mountains
deserts
seacoast
beaches
sand
dunes
waterfalls
springs
etcetera
with
which
the
area
is
blessed
as
the
national
and
state
parks
place
emphasis
on
features
which
are
of
national
or
state
significance
counties
should
seek
out
these
features
which
are
distinctive
of
their
area
the
site
may
not
contain
the
features
themselves
there
are
often
opportunities
to
include
them
as
additional
interest
to
the
site
route
to
the
park
may
lead
people
past
them
or
display
views
of
them
group
of
native
trees
or
plants
which
are
outstanding
in
a
particular
county
can
be
featured
at
the
site
fish
animals
and
birds
which
may
be
found
at
the
site
are
another
interest
interest
calls
for
a
check
of
the
species
found
quantity
and
size
the
season
they
are
available
and
the
stocking
program
of
the
fish
commission
may
be
present
at
the
site
or
provide
hunting
in
nearby
areas
site
may
be
on
one
of
the
major
flyways
of
migratory
birds
or
have
its
own
resident
bird
life
crabs
and
other
marine
life
may
add
interest
at
coastal
areas
area
has
its
own
historical
interests
with
which
much
can
be
done
visitors
are
always
eager
to
learn
more
about
the
area
they
are
in
historical
sign
tells
its
story
but
nothing
gets
interest
across
as
well
as
some
of
the
original
historical
items
or
places
themselves
which
still
have
the
character
of
the
period
covered
should
be
taken
of
unusual
rock
formations
deposits
or
shapes
of
the
crust
in
your
region
which
tell
a
story
of
the
formation
in
each
area
can
add
geological
interest
to
the
recreation
sites
old
shipwreck
a
high
dam
an
old
covered
bridge
a
place
to
find
agates
or
other
stones
or
a

to
pan
gold
etcetera
may
be
of
interest
areas
may
provide
archeological
values
such
as
ancient
village
sites
or
hunting
areas
caves
artifacts
etcetera
well
can
the
site
be
developed
at
the
physical
features
of
the
land
to
determine
how
desirable
it
is
for
use
what
can
be
done
to
correct
the
faults
and
what
it
will
cost
to
make
the
area
meet
your
needs
in
comparison
to
other
sites
things
need
to
be
checked
size
and
shape
size
of
the
area
alone
can
be
a
determining
factor
area
may
be
too
small
for
the
needs
of
the
project
should
be
large
enough
to
include
the
attractions
have
ample
space
for
the
use
of
facilities
needed
and
have
room
around
the
edges
to
protect
the
values
of
the
area
from
encroachment
by
private
developments
in
excess
of
the
minimum
is
good
practice
as
recreation
areas
are
never
too
large
for
the
future
and
it
is
often
more
economical
to
operate
one
large
area
than
several
small
ones
of
the
area
is
also
related
to
the
use
attractions
and
needs
of
the
development
large
picnic
area
or
camping
development
is
most
efficient
in
shape
as
a
square
or
rectangle
several
hundred
feet
in
width
in
preference
to
a
long
narrow
area
less
than
one
hundred
feet
wide
is
true
because
of
savings
in
utility
lines
and
the
fact
that
your
buildings
have
a
useful
radius
equal
in
all
directions
a
narrow
strip
may
be
very
practical
for
small
developments
or
to
provide
additional
stream
frontage
for
a
trail
or
include
scenic
strips
within
the

may
be
affected
by
the
appearance
of
the
adjoining

the
utilities
available
there

a
site
adjoining

at

by

what

the

defection

as
an
escape

those
who
dare
not

prefer
not
to
face
the
discipline
of
modern
traditionalism
with
what
resource
did
back
up
his
of

with

the

will

who
was
fully
aware

from

can
anyone
be

that
would

done
better

think
the

is
to
be

the

the
beautifully
patterned
art
of
like
this
master
realizes
his
subjects
in
large
simplified
masses
which
though
they
seem
effortless
are
in
reality
the
result
of
skilled
design
born
of
hard
work
and
a
thorough
distillation
of
the
natural
form
that
inspired
them
a

the
long
process
of
extracting
the
goodness
of
the
its
tang
of

its
change
of
seasons
its
variable
moods
father
a
professional
engraver
and
an
amateur
landscape
painter
took
his
sons
on
numerous
hunting
expeditions
and
imparted
to
them
his
knowledge
and
love
of
nature
of
this
background
of
hunting
and
fishing
it
was
only
natural
that
first
painted
subjects
he
knew
best
hunters
in
the
field
fishermen
in
the
stream
ducks
and
geese
on
the
wing
almost
always
against
a
vast
backdrop
of
weather
landscape
is
this
subject
matter
that
has
brought
a
large
and
enthusiastic
following
among
sportsmen
but
it
is
his
exceptional
performance
with
this
motif
that
commends
him
to
artists
and
discerning
collectors
had
to
earn
the
privilege
of
devoting
himself
exclusively
to
painting
many
others
he
had
to
work
hard
long
hours
in
a
struggling
family
business
which
though
it
was
allied
to
art
of
a
kind
the
design
and
production
of
engraved
seals
bore
no
relation
to
the
painting
of
pictures
it
did
teach
the
basic
techniques
of
commercial
art
and
later
for
twelve
years
he
and
his
sister
conducted
an
advertising
art
studio
in
the
death
of
their
father
they
returned
to
their
home
in
more
years
of
concentrated
effort
and
his
brother
finally
established
a
thriving
family
business
at
the
old
stand
all
this
time
continued
to
paint
first
only
on
weekends
and
then
as
the
family
business
permitted
for
longer
periods
he
withdrew
from
the
shop
altogether
and
for
the
past
thirty
years
he
has
worked
independently
as
a
painter
except
for
his
continued
hunting
and
fishing
expeditions
even
on
these
the
palette
often
takes
over
while
the
shotgun
cools
off
for
a
rich
friendship
with
the
painter
who
gave
him
the
only
professional
instruction
he
ever
had
and
this
was
limited
to
a
few
lessons
though
the
two
artists
often
went
on
painting
trips
together
developed
his
art
by
himself
the
best
tradition
he
first
taught
himself
to
see
then
to
draw
with
accuracy
and
assurance
and
then
to
paint
worked
in
oil
for
years
before
beginning
his
work
in
watercolor
and
his
first
public
recognition
and
early
honors
including
his
election
to
the
were
for
his
essays
in
the
heavier
medium
watercolor
claimed
his
greater
affection
until
today
it
has
become
his
major
if
not
exclusive
technique
has
been
my
privilege
to
paint
with
on
numerous
occasions
mostly
in
the
vicinity
of
often
than
not
have
found
easy
excuse
to
leave
my
own
work
and
stand
at
a
respectable
distance
where
could
watch
this
man
transform
raw
nature
into
a
composed
not
imitative
painting
have
observed
time
and
time
again
is
a
process
of
integration
integration
that
begins
as
abstract
design
and
gradually
takes
on
recognizable
form
color
patterns
that
are
made
to
weave
throughout
the
whole
composition
and
that
amazing
control
of
large
washes
which
is
the
stylemark
come
those
little
flicks
of
a
rigger
brush
and
the
job
is
done
yes
instructive
maybe
duplicable
no
for
the
technical
fact
we
have
the
own
testimony
late
years
find
that
like
best
to
work
make
preliminary
watercolor
sketches
in
quarter
scale
approximately
inches
in
which
pay
particular
attention
to
the
design
principles
of
three
simple
values
the
lightest
light
the
middle
tone
and
the
darkest
dark
by
reducing
the
forms
of
my
subject
to
these
large
patterns
a
human
figure
or
wild
life
are
to
be
part
of
the
projected
final
picture
try
to
place
them
in
the
initial
sketch
me
these
will
belong
more
completely
to
their
surroundings
if
they
are
conceived
in
this
early
stage
though
freely
admit
that
do
not
hesitate
to
add
or
eliminate
figures
on
the
full
sheet
when
it
serves
my
final
purpose
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
most
watercolors
suffer
because
the
artist
expects
nature
will
do
his
composing
for
him
as
a
result
such
pictures
are
only
a
literal
translation
of
what
the
artist
finds
in
the
scene
before
him
because
a
tree
or
other
object
appears
in
a
certain
spot
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
place
it
in
the
same
position
in
the
painting
unless
the
position
serves
the
design
of
the
whole
composition
the
artist
would
study
his
work
more
thoroughly
and
move
certain
units
in
his
design
often
only
slightly
finer
pictures
would
result
of
long
experience
have
found
that
incidental
figures
and
other
objects
like
trees
logs
and
bushes
can
be
traced
from
the
original
sketch
and
moved
about
in
the
major
areas
on
the
final
sheet
until
they
occupy
the
right
position
which
call
clicking
in
painting
a
picture
is
valid
only
when
it
imparts
spontaneity
and
crispness
but
unless
the
artist
has
lots
of
experience
so
that
he
can
control
rapid
execution
he
would
do
well
to
take
these
first
sketches
and
soberly
reorder
their
design
to
achieve
a
unified
composition
have
seemed
to
emphasize
the
structure
of
the
composition
mean
to
project
equal
concern
for
color
in
working
under
all
conditions
of
light
and
atmosphere
a
particular
passage
that
looked
favorable
in
relation
to
the
subject
will
be
too
bright
too
dull
or
too
light
or
too
dark
when
viewed
indoors
in
a
mat
this
occurs
make
the
change
on
the
sketch
or
on
the
final
watercolor
if
have
been
working
on
a
full
sheet

the
field

from
one
of
my
sketches

it
up

am

that
for
me
at

a
workmanlike
method
is
important
and
error
are
better
placed
in
the
preliminary

than
in
hoping
for
miracles
in

the
best

to

to

to

great
absorbency
of
this
tissue
and
the
fact
that

analyzing
the
watercolors
of
the
first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
is
their
essential
decorativeness
yet
this
word
has
such
a
varied
connotation
that
it
needs
some
elaboration
here
a
watercolor
is
unmistakably
a
synthesis
of
nature
rather
than
a
detailed
inventory
many
decorative
patterns
that
present
a
static
flat
convention
this
pictures
are
full
of
atmosphere
and
climate
observation
has
taught
that
most
landscape
can
be
reduced
to
three
essential
planes
a
foreground
in
sharp
focus
either
a
light
area
with
dark
accents
or
a
dark
one
with
lights
a
middle
distance
often
containing
the
major
motif
and
a
background
usually
a
silhouetted
form
foiled
against
the
sky
following
this
general
principle
provides
the
observer
with
a
natural
eye
progression
from
foreground
to
background
and
the
illusion
of
depth
is
instantly
created
painting
physical
eyes
are
while
his
eye
is
wide
open
and
this
circumstance
accounts
in
part
for
the
impression
he
wishes
to
convey
does
not
insist
on
telling
all
he
knows
about
any
given
subject
rather
his
pictures
invite
the
observer
to
draw
on
his
memory
his
imagination
his
nostalgia
is
for
this
reason
that
avoids
selecting
subjects
that
require
specific
recognition
of
place
for
their
enjoyment
pictures
generalize
though
they
are
inspired
by
a
particular
locale
they
universalize
in
terms
of
weather
skies
earth
and
people
dealing
with
common
landscape
in
an
uncommon
way
has
found
a
particular
niche
in
landscape
art
with
his
watercolors
is
a
vicarious
experience
of
seeing
nature
distilled
through
the
eyes
of
a
sensitive
interpretor
a
breath
and
breadth
of
the
outdoor
world
to
help

the
of
it
all
artist
was
born
in
in
and
until
two
years
ago
when
he
and
his
wife
moved
to
he
lived
in
western
in
looked
up
the
actual
date
of
his
birth
and
found
it
to
be
realized
that
was
born
under
the
right
zodiacal
sign
for
a
watercolorist
the
water
sign
of
thru
how
very
often
a
water
plane
is
featured
in
his
landscapes
and
how
appropriate
that
he
should
appear
in
again
in
his
natal
month
of

the
tar
out
of
the
gymnasts
in
the
for
one
reason
they
were
better
were
better
trained
better
looking
better
built
better
disciplined
and
something
else
they
were
better
dancers
athletes
are
only
just
beginning
to
learn
that
they
must
study
dance
are
all
trained
as
dancers
before
they
start
to
study
gymnastics
why
gymnastics
at
all
is
the
sport
really
important
all
we
did
pretty
well
in
some
other
areas
of
the
competition
if
it
is
important
what
can
we
do
to
improve
ourselves
is
more
than
just
lack
of
dance
training
that
is
our
problem
for
just
as
gymnastics
can
learn
from
dance
dance
has
some
very
important
things
to
learn
from
gymnastics
first
things
first
understand
the
sport
called
gymnastics
is
made
up
of
tumbling
which
might
be
said
to
start
with
a
somersault
run
through
such
stunts
as
headstands
handstands
cartwheels
backbends
and
culminate
in
nearly
impossible
combinations
of
aerial
flips
and
twists
and
apparatus
work
apparatus
used
by
gymnasts
was
once
a
common
sight
in
gyms
but
about
it
was
dropped
in
favor
of
games
parallel
bars
horse
buck
springboard
horizontal
bar
rings
and
mats
formerly
in
the
school
gyms
were
replaced
by
baseball
volleyball
basketball
and
football
the
use
gymnastics
as
the
first
step
in
training
for
all
other
sports
because
it
provides
training
in
every
basic
quality
except
one
endurance
gymnast
must
develop
strength
flexibility
coordination
timing
rhythm
courage
discipline
persistence
and
the
desire
for
perfection
short
gymnastics
uses
every
part
of
the
body
and
requires
a
great
deal
of
character
as
well
addition
of
endurance
training
later
when
the
body
is
mature
enough
to
benefit
from
it
without
danger
of
injury
provides
that
final
quality
that
makes
the
top
athlete
soldier
or
citizen
reason
gymnastic
study
is
valuable
is
that
it
can
be
started
very
early
in
life
enterprising
teacher
or
parent
could
start
training
a
healthy
child
at
the
age
of
seven
days
have
been
exercising
newborn
infants
for
centuries
most
sports
as
in
most
walks
of
life
the
angels
are
on
the
side
of
those
who
begin
young
and
the
competitor
of
has
at
least
thirteen
years
of
training
behind
him
is
very
lucky
if
he
has
three
a
nation
wished
to
get
a
head
start
in
physical
fitness
over
all
other
nations
it
would
start
its
kindergarten
students
on
a
program
of
gymnastics
the
day
they
entered
and
thus
eliminate
a
large
number
of
the
problems
that
plague
schools
of
the
problems
attacked
would
be
fatigue
and
emotional
tension
since
action
relieves
both
enough
it
is
proven
that
there
would
be
less
reading
difficulty
there
would
be
less
anxiety
fewer
accidents
it
is
the
clumsy
child
who
sustains
the
worst
injuries
and
higher
scholastic
averages
since
alert
children
work
better
knows
this
and
that
is
why
there
were
over
competing
for
places
as
candidates
for
the
gymnastic
team
thousand
won
top
honors
and
a
chance
to
try
for
the
team
itself
could
scarcely
find
eighty
in
our
great
land
of
over
million
people
what
has
dancing
to
do
with
all
this
great
deal
young
gymnasts
have
studied
dance
before
having
the
rigorous
training
on
apparatus
trained
in
posture
and
coordinated
movement
and
wedded
to
rhythm
they
presented
the
audiences
in
with
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sights
ever
seen
at
any
contest
audiences
in
particular
learned
two
valuable
lessons
saw
completely
masculine
and
obviously
virile
men
performing
with
incredible
grace
were
further
stripped
of
old
tales
by
seeing
the
slender
lovely
girls
performing
feats
requiring
tremendous
strength
and
with
not
one
bulging
muscle
has
asked
that
we
become
a
physically
fit
nation
we
wait
until
children
are
in
junior
high
or
high
school
we
will
never
manage
it
be
fit
one
has
to
start
early
with
young
children
and
today
the
only
person
who
really
reaches
such
children
is
the
teacher
of
dance
the
dance
teachers
of
make
it
their
business
to
prepare
their
young
charges
for
the
gymnastics
that
must
come
some
day
if
our
schools
are
really
responsible
we
will
be
that
much
ahead
teachers
all
too
unprepared
for
the
job
they
must
do
will
need
demonstrators
should
be
youngsters
who
know
how
to
do
a
headstand
and
also
how
to
help
other
children
learn
it
should
know
simple
exercises
that
could
prepare
less
fortunate
children
for
the
sports
we
will
demand
be
taught
teachers
can
respond
to
request
not
only
through
their
regular
dance
work
but
also
through
the
kind
of
basic
gymnastic
work
that
makes
for
strength
and
flexibility
little
in
living
provides
the
strength
we
need
and
nothing
provides
the
flexibility
do
have
flexibility
often
fail
however
to
develop
real
abdominal
back
chest
shoulder
and
arm
strength
any
group
of
ballerinas
to
do
ten
or
three
and
the
results
considering
the
amount
of
physical
training
they
have
had
will
be
very
disappointing
the
boys
will
not
be
outstanding
in
these
areas
surprising
when
we
consider
that
over
percent
of
the
boys
in
cannot
chin
themselves
once
and
that
school
girls
outdo
them
in
almost
every
test
even
dashes
and
endurance
only
area
in
which
boys
hold
their
own
is
the
baseball
throw
chinning
bar
arm
and
shoulder
strength
a
chinning
bar
is
recommended
should
be
installed
over
a
door
that
is
in
full
view
of
everyone
and
a
chair
should
be
placed
under
it
a
little
to
one
side
children
who
can
chin
themselves
should
be
told
to
do
one
each
time
they
pass
under
it
who
are
too
weak
should
climb
on
the
chair
and
starting
at
the
top
of
the
chin
let
themselves
slowly
down
they
can
take
ten
seconds
to
accomplish
the
descent
they
will
have
the
strength
to
should
be
informed
about
this
system
and
encouraged
to
do
the
same
with
the
whole
family

with
legs
wide
apart
and
upper

bent
forward
by
falling
forward
to
a
point
close
to
the
feet
and
as
strength
improves
fall
farther
and
farther
out
to
push
back
to
the
stand
position
from
the
stretched
position
without
any
intermediate
pushes
from

can
be
taught
by
starting
at
the
top
of
the

legs
spread
wide
the
body

slowly
taking
at
least
five
seconds
for
the
letting

of
these
done
daily
for
about
a
week

develop
the
strength
for
one
come
after
arms
chest
and
shoulders
have
developed
at
least
a
minimum
of
strength
course
those
who
have
developed
more
will
find
them
easier
with
the
class
standing
in
a
circle
with
weight
on
the
right
foot
and
the
left
extended
a
little
way
into
the
circle
first
each
child
should
do
a
by
himself
so
that
the
teacher
can
determine
those
ready
to
work
alone
and
those
who
need
help
both
hands
to
the
floor
and
at
the
same
time
kick
the
right
foot
up
in
back
left

follow
at
once
right

land
first
followed
by
the
left
to
the
standing
position
should
be
taken
to
see
that
the
hands
are
placed
on
the
floor
before
the
kick
starts
and
also
that
the
landing
foot
is
brought
as
close
to
the
hands
as
possible
will
prevent
flat
falls
and
toe
injuries
feet
are
better
for
such
work
than
any
form
of
slipper
the
class
will
be
able
to
kick
up
high
enough
so
that
the
teacher
can
catch
the
leading
leg
child
should
then
bring
both
legs
together
overhead
point
the
toes
and
tighten
the
seat
muscles
sure
that
the
landing
foot
is
brought
close
to
the

and
that
only
one
foot
lands

a
time
backbend
is
of
extreme
importance
to
any
form
of
free
gymnastics
and
as
with
all
acrobatics
the
sooner
begun
the
better
the
results
the
class
lie
supine
with
knees
apart
and
bent
flat
palms
on
either
side
of
the
head
a
few
inches
away
from
the
ears
fingers
pointing
toward
the
shoulders
the
back
upwards
to
make
a
bridge
sure
the
head
drops
backward
so
that
the
child
looks
at
the
floor
rather
than
toward
the
ceiling
flexibility
improves
the
feet
will
move
closer
to
the
hands
and
the
bridge
rise
higher
this
can
be
combined
with
the
handstand
to
provide
a
walkover
circle
further
increase
back
flexibility

the

be
measured
by
the
lessening
distance
between

last
essential
to
the
gymnastic
program
is
the
somersault
or
forward
roll
used
to
be
part
of
every
bag
of
tricks
but
few
children
can
do
it
today
some
are
actually
incapable
of
rolling
forward
and
are
completely
confused
when
not
sitting
or
standing
upright
most
small
children
learning
a
forward
roll
is
simply
a
matter
of
copying
another
child
who
can
it
has
been
seen
have
the
child
start
on
a
mat
on
hands
and
knees
a
thin
inexpensive
mat
is
quite
sufficient
for
anything
that
does
not
require
falling
places
the
hands
on
either
side
of
the
head
keeping
the
chin
down
on
the
chest
then
pushes
his
seat
into
the
air
and
the
teacher
guides
it
over
or
two
practice
runs
should
be
sufficient
for
solo
however
the
child
is
weak
overweight
or
afraid
more
help
will
be
needed
the
child
raises
his
seat
into
the
air
the
teacher
takes
hold
under
both
sides
of
the
pelvis
then
no
matter
what
happens
the
performance
will
be
controlled
lifting
the
seat
upwards
a
little
the
weight
is
taken
off
the
neck
and
the
back
is
kept
rounded
are
beginnings
but
correctly
learned
they
prepare
for
satisfying
and
exciting
stunts
that
can
be
performed
by
a
strong
flexible
body
we
are
not
talking
of
eccentric
extremes
if
gymnastics
are
not
the
ultimate
goal
the
good
tumbler
will
be
a
better
dancer
a
better
athlete
and
a
human
being
with
a
greater
margin
of
safety
in
any
activity
is
very
important
for
parents
to
understand
that
early
training
is
imperative
dancing
school
so
helpful
in
artistic
and
psychological
development
also
contributes
to
this
essential
early
training
and
can
contribute
even
more

alone
the

has
enormous
possibilities
benefits
electronics
can
bring
to
may
be
greater
by
far
than
any

been
applied
to
medicine
for
many
years
in
the
form
of
such
familiar

this

we
will
concentrate
on
the
advances
in
the
application
of

laboratories
because
this
is
where

the
wide

perfected
in

we
have
selected
a
few
examples
which
appear
to
be
headed
for
use
in
the
immediate

and
which
offer
completely
new
tools
in
medical

completely
new
insight
into
living
cells
and
their
structure
will
be
possible
by
use
of
a
new
technique
which
replaces

primarily
indicates
irregularities
in
the
heartbeat
but
techniques
allow
exact
measurements
of
the
flow
of
blood
through
the
aorta
dimensioning
of
the
heart
and
its
chambers
and
a
much
more
detailed
study
of
each
heartbeat
many
of
these
measurements
the

must
be
opened
but
the
blood
vessels
and
the
heart
itself
remain
undisturbed
group
of
researchers
at
the
of
have
given
a
paper
which
briefly
outlines
some
of
these
techniques
simple
method
of
measuring
the
expansion
of
the
heart
is
to
tie
a
thin
rubber
tube
filled
with
mercury
around
the
heart
and
record
the
change
in
resistance
as
the
tube
is
stretched
balanced
resistance
bridge
and
a
pen
recorder
are
all
the
electronic
instrumentation
needed
can
be
used
to
measure
the
thickness
of
the
heart
by
placing
small
crystal
transducers
at
opposite
sides
of
the
heart
or
blood
vessel
and
exciting
one
with
some
pulsed
ultrasonic
energy
travel
time
of
sound
in
tissue
is
about
meters
per
second
thus
it
takes
about
to
traverse
of
tissue
sonar
or
of
pulse
generator
and
measuring
system
is
required
for
evaluation
addition
to
the
heart
and
aorta
successful
measurements
of
liver
and
spleen
have
also
been
made
by
this
technique
effect
using
ultrasonic
signals
can
be
employed
to
measure
the
flow
of
blood
without
cutting
into
the
blood
vessel
still
more
sophisticated
system
has
been
devised
for
determining
the
effective
power
of
the
heart
itself
uses
both
an
ultrasonic
dimensioning
arrangement
of
the
heart
and
a
catheter
carrying
a
thermistor
inserted
into
the
bloodstream
latter
measures
the
heat
carried
away
by
the
bloodstream
as
an
indication
of
the
velocity
of
the
blood
flow
is
also
possible
to
utilize
a
pressure
transducer
mounted
at
the
end
of
a
catheter
which
is
inserted
into
the
left
ventricle
to
indicate
the
blood
pressure
in
the
heart
itself
pressure
measurement
may
be
made
at
the
same
time
that
the
ultrasonic
dimensioning
measurement
is
made
simplified
version
of
the
instrumentation
for
this
procedure
is
shown
in
of
the
two
systems

measured
by
a

pills
years
ago
headlines
were
made
by
a
small
radio
transmitter
capsule
which
could
be
swallowed
by
the
patient
and
which
would
then
radio
internal
pressure
data
to
external
receivers
original
capsule
contained
a
battery
and
a
transistor
oscillator
and
was
about
in
diameter
life
limited
the
use
of
this
pill
to
about
to
hours
maximum
refinement
of
this
technique
has
been
described
by
and
and
of
the
of
the
this
novel
arrangement
the
pill
is
much
smaller
and
contains
only
a
resonant
circuit
in
which
the
capacitor
is
formed
by
a
transducer
shown
in
an
external
antenna
is
placed
over
or
around
the
patient
and
excited
times
a
second
with
short
bursts
energy
received
by
the
pill
causes
the
resonant
circuit
to
ring
on
after
the
burst
and
this
ringing
takes
place
at
the
resonant
frequency
of
the
pill
frequencies
are
amplified
and
detected
by
the
receiver
after
each
burst
of
transmitted
energy
and
after
the
pill
has
been
calibrated
precise
internal
pressure
indications
can
be
obtained
of
the
advantages
of
this
method
is
that
the
pill
can
remain
in
the
patient
for
several
days
permitting
observation
under
natural
conditions
to
organs
other
than
the
gastrointestinal
tract

planned
for

of
the
most
gratifying
applications
of
an
important
technique
of
submarine
detection
is
in
the
exploration
of
the
human

readers
are
familiar
with
the
principles
of
sonar
where
sound
waves
are
sent
out
in
water
and
the
echoes
then
indicate
submerged
objects
methods

displaying
these
sound

are
used
to
detect
submarines

floors
and
even
communicate
under

medicine
the
frequencies
are
much
higher
transducers
and
the
sonar
beams
themselves
are
much
smaller
and
different
scanning
techniques
may
be
used
but
the
principles
involved
are
the
same
as
in
sonar
the
body
contains
so
much
liquid
transmission
of
ultrasonic
signals
proceeds
fairly
well
in
muscles
and
blood
vessels
and
cartilage
transmit
poorly
and
tend
to
reflect
the
ultrasonic
signals
on
this
phenomenon
a
number
of
investigators
have
used
this
method
to
look
through
human
organs

two
older

therefore
went
daily
to
the

taught
the
two
boys
to
read

later
joined
them
for
instruction
with
the
wigmaker
and
also
arithmetic
was
added
to
reading
and
in
the
informal
curriculum
contributions
were
soon
exhausted
and
the
boys
had
to
turn
to
a
wider
circle

student
days
were
at
a
time
when
was
in
a
new
intellectual
ferment
following
the
revolutions
in

in
and
were
rising
from
divisive
nationalisms
and
a
strong
wave
of
intellectual
awareness
was
sweeping
the
new
century
opened
with
beginning
his
professional
career
in
charge
of
an
apothecary
shop
in
and
as
lecturer
at
the
university
was
stirred
by
the
announcement
of
discovery
of
chemical
electricity
and
he
immediately
applied
the
voltaic
pile
to
experiments
with
acids
and
alkalis
following
year
he
devoted
to
the
customary
traveling
in

the
meeting
the

and
also
met

lived
to

the
event
occur
but
was
the
author
of
it
returned
to
and
applied
for
the
chair
in
physics
but
was
rejected
because
he
was
probably
considered
more
a
philosopher
than
a
physicist
he
continued
experimenting
and
lecturing
publishing
the
results
of
his
experiments
in
and
periodicals
his
ambition
was
realized
and
he
became
professor
of

not
realizing

until
attendance
at
the

it
was
poorly
equipped

in

the

that

increased
the

more
than
did
salts
as
he
was
to
pursue
this
promising
line
he
was
so
loaded
down
with
the
management
of
the
pharmacy
and
lectures
in
the
medical
and
pharmaceutical
faculties
at
the
university
that
he
could
devote
only
afternoons
to
galvanizing
assumed
his
academic
career
with
the
same
intensity
and
thoroughness
that
had
marked
every
step
in
his
rise
from
boyhood
university
was
the
only
one
in
and
the
status
of
professor
represented
the
upper
social
level
broad
interest
in
literary
political
and
philosophical
movements
opened
many
doors
to
him
friends
were
numerous
and
their
ties
to
him
were
strong
years
and
saw
him
in
and
again
but
on
this
visit
to
he
did
not
seek
out
the
philosophers
as
he
had
on
his
first
journey
he
published
his
views
of
the
chemical
laws
of
nature
in
and
this
was
issued
in
translation
under
the
title
chimiques
et

a
work
held
in
very
high
esteem
by
the
new
generation
of
research
chemists
interest
in
finding
a
relationship
between
voltaic
electricity
and
magnetism
is
here
first
indicated
is
entitled
and
in
it
are
included
such
remarks
as
has
always
been
tempted
to
compare
the
magnetic
forces
with
the
electrical
forces
great
resemblance
between
electrical
and
magnetic
attractions
and
repulsions
and
the
similarity
of
their
laws
necessarily
would
bring
about
this
comparison
is
true
that
nothing
has
been
found
comparable
with
electricity
by
communication
but
the
phenomena
observed
had
such
a
degree
of
analogy
to
those
depending
on
electrical
distribution
that
one
could
not
find
the
slightest
difference
form
of
galvanic
activity
is
halfway
between
the
magnetic
form
and
the
electrical
form
forces
are
more
latent
than
in
electricity
and
less
than
in
magnetism
in
such
an
important
question
we
would
be
satisfied
if
the
judgment
were
that
the
principal
objection
to
the
identity
of
forces
which
produce
electricity
and
magnetism
were
only
a
difficulty
and
not
a
thing
which
is
contrary
to
it
could
also
add
to
these
analogies
that
steel
loses
its
magnetism
by
heat
which
proves
that
steel
becomes
a
better
conductor
through
a
rise
in
temperature
just
as
electrical
bodies
do
is
also
found
that
magnetism
exists
in
all
bodies
of
nature
as
proven
by
and
that
one
feels
that
magnetic
forces
are
as
general
as
electrical
forces
attempt
should
be
made
to
see
if
electricity
in
its
most
latent
stage
has
any
action
on
the
magnet
as
such
plan
and
intent
were
clearly
charted
returned
in
and
resumed
an
active
part
in
university
and
political
discussions
one
debate
he
supported
the
freedom
of
judgment
as
opposed
to
dogma
in
another
he
held
that
the
practice
of
science
was
in
fact
an
act
of
religious
worship
continued
as
a
popular
lecturer
devised
a
detonating
fuse
in
which
a
short
wire
was
caused
to
glow
by
an
electric
current
under
royal
command
he
undertook
a
very
successful
geological
expedition
to
one
of
the
islands
being
one
of
three
scientists
in
the
expedition
was
with
the
assistance
of
one
of
the
members
of
this
expedition
that
succeeded
in
producing
light
by
creating
an
electric
discharge
in
mercury
vapor
through
which
an
electric
current
was
made
to
flow
they
also
developed
a
new
form
of
voltaic
cell
in
which
the
wooden
trough
was
replaced
by
one
of
copper
thereby
producing
stronger
currents
was
among
those
who
witnessed
first
demonstration
of
his
discovery
of
electromagnetism
the
association
between
electric
both
electrostatic
and
voltaic
forces
and
magnetic
forces
had
been
recognized
by
investigators
for
many
decades
literature
contained
numerous
references
to
lightning
that
had
magnetized
iron
and
had
altered
the
polarity
of
compass
needles
the
late
and
among
others
had
magnetized
iron
by
sending
an
electrostatic
charge
through
it
had
almost
stumbled
on
a
lead
to
the
relationship
between
electricity
and
magnetism
when
a
discharge
from
a
jar
was
sent
transversally
through
a
piece
of
steel
making
its
ends
magnetic
resulting
magnetic
effect
proved
stronger
than
when
the
discharge
was
made
lengthwise
experiments
of
and
others
have
already
been
noted
but
no
one
had
determined
the
relationship
between
these
two
primary
forces
own
earlier
experiments
were
unimpressive
possibly
because
he
had
like
other
experimenters
laid
the
conducting
wire
across
the
compass
needle
instead
of
parallel
with
it
sequence
of
events
leading
to
his
important
discovery
still
remains
ambiguous
but
it
seems
that
one
of
the
advanced
students
at
the
university
related
that
the
first
direct
event
that
led
to
the
publication
of
discovery
occurred
during
a

cattle
bunks
cattle
eat
from
one
side
while

is
put
in
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
by
wagons
bunks
they
sit
within

lot
are
filled

mechanical
conveyor

bunks
as
discussed
here
they
permit

all
sides
is
put

with
an
elevator
materials
or
combinations
of
materials
can
be
used
to
construct
a
satisfactory
feed
bunk
selection
of
materials
depends
on
skills
of
available
labor
for
installation
cost
of
materials
available
locally
and
your
own
preference
one
material
is
best
for
all
situations
bunks
by
economic
comparison
is
usually
an
individual
problem
feeding
eat
only
from
one
side
so
the
bunk
must
be
twice
as
long
as
the
mechanical
bunk
bunks
also
serve
as
a
fence
so
part
of
the
additional
cost
must
be
attributed
to
the
fence
of
their
location
on
the
edge
of
the
feed
lot
bunks
are
not
in
the
way

bunks

wagons

this
kind
of

climate
what
competitive
marketing
problems
will
your

face
in
the
next
on
our

with

we
see
major
problems
which
fall
into
three
broad
groups
the
market
place
itself
marketing
methods
and
marketing

in
the
market
greater
has
been
an
intensification
of
in

there

every
indication
it

continue
wittingly
or
unwittingly
has
been
fostered
by
manufacturers

generally
good
levels
of
income
we
see
greater
price
pressures
than
ever
before
traveling
back
along
the
chain
from
consumer
to
distributor
to
manufacturer
are
some
key
areas
to
examine
to
make
sure
your
pricing
strategy
will
be
on

the
probable

situation
in
your

studies
been
made
of
every
phase
of

to

what
might
be
done
if
things
get
worse
you
actually
checked
out
not
just
mentally
tested
different
selling
approaches
designed
to
counter
the
price
competition
problem
customer
sophistication
consumer
is
becoming
more
sophisticated
regarding
product
and
advertising
claims
partly
because
of
widespread
criticism
of
such
assertions
problem
can
force
a
change
in
marketing
approach
in
many
kinds
of
businesses
you
examined
this
problem
of
increasing
consumer
sophistication
from
the
standpoint
of
your
own
company
demand
for
services
for
service
is
here
to
stay
and
the
problem
is
going
to
be
tougher
to
solve
in
the
sixties
are
two
reasons
for
this
most
products
tend
to
become
more
complex
in
a
competitive
market
the
customer
feels
his
weight
and
throws
it
around
good
customer
service
requires
as
thorough
a
marketing
and
general
management
planning
job
as
the
original
selling
of
the
product
often
it
is
thought
of
at
the
last
moment
of
new
product
introduction
service
starts
with
product
design
and
planning
products
seem
to
be
designed
for
a
production
economy
not
for
a
service
one
requires
training
your
own
sales
organization
and
your
distributor
organizations
not
only
in
the
techniques
but
also
in
good
customer
relations
you
assessed
the
importance
of
service
and
given
it
proper
attention
discretionary
choices
for
customers
spending
his
money
today
the
consumer
is
pulled
in
many
directions
the
manufacturer
of
the
more
product
the
purchase
of
which
can
be
switched
delayed
or
put
off
entirely
the
implications
are
important
competition
is
now
proportionately
greater
you
are
competing
not
only
against
manufacturers
in
the
same
field
but
also
against
a
vast
array
of
manufacturers
of
other

been
in

many
years

shifts
to
the

from

will
continue
in

you

it
is

have
been
under

controversy
of
the
last
few
years
over
whether
architects
or
interior
designers
should
plan
the
interiors
of
modern
buildings
has
brought
clearly
into
focus
one
important
difference
of
opinion
architects
do
not
believe
that
the
education
of
the
interior
designer
is
sufficiently
good
or
sufficiently
extended
to
compare
with
that
of
the
architect
and
that
therefore
the
interior
designer
is
incapable
of
understanding
the
architectural
principles
involved
in
planning
the
interior
of
a
building
politeness
may
have
militated
against
this
opinion
being
stated
so
badly
but
anyone
with
a
wide
acquaintance
in
both
groups
and
who
has
sat
through
the
many
round
tables
workshops
or
panel
discussions
whatever
they
are
called
on
this
subject
will
recognize
that
the
final
boiled
down
crux
of
the
matter
is
education
is
true
that
most
architectural
schools
have
five
year
courses
some
even
have
six
or
more
element
of
public
danger
which
enters
so
largely
into
architectural
certification
however
would
demand
a
prolonged
study
of
structure
would
naturally
lengthen
their
courses
far
beyond
the
largely
esthetic
demands
of
interior
training
may
then
dismiss
the
time
difference
between
these
courses
and
the
usual
four
year
course
of
the
interior
design
student
as
not
having
serious
bearing
on
the
subject
real
question
that
follows
is
how
are
those
four
years
used
and
what
is
their
value
as
training
of
has
published
a
recommended
course
for
designers
and
a
percentage

of
such
a

of
some
forty
catalogs
of
schools
offering
courses
in

the
most
part

accredited
by
membership
in
the
of
of
and
a
further
on
the
spot
inspection
of
a
number
of
schools
show
their
courses
adhere
pretty
closely
to
the
recommendations
or
two
of
the
schools
have
a
five
year
curriculum
but
the
usual
pattern
of
education
has
limited
most
of
them
to
the
plan
which
seems
to
be
the
minimum
in
acceptable
institutions
suggested
course
of
the
was
based
on
the
usual
course
offered
and
on
the
opinion
of
many
educators
as
to
curricular
necessities
the
four
year
provision
limits
this
to
fundamentals
and
much
desirable
material
must
be
eliminated
comparing
the
relative
merits
of
the
two
courses
architecture
versus
interior
design
let
us
examine
the
educational
needs
of
the
interior
designer
begin
with
what
is
an
interior
designer
published
by
the
of
describes
him
as
follows
plans
and
furnishes
interiors
of
houses
commercial
and
institutional
structures
hotels
clubs
ships
theaters
as
well
as
set
decorations
for
motion
picture
arts
and
television
drawings
and
plans
of
rooms
showing
placement
of
furniture
floor
coverings
wall
decorations
and
determines
color
schemes
complete
cost
estimates
for
clients
approval
necessary
purchases
places
contracts
supervises
construction
installation
finishing
and
placement
of
furniture
fixtures
and
other
correlated
furnishings
and
follows
through
to
completion
of
project
addition
to
this
the
when
examining
applicants
for
government
positions
as
interior
designers
expects
that
when
various
needed
objects
are
not
obtainable
on
the
market
he
will
design
them
must
be
capable
of
designing
for
and
supervising
the
manufacture
of
any
craft
materials
needed
in
the
furnishings
seems
like
a
large
order
interior
designer
then
must
first
be
an
artist
but
also
understand
carpentry
and
painting
and
lighting
and
plumbing
and
finance
nobody
will
question
the
necessity
of
all
this
and
any
reputable
interior
designer
does
know
all
this
and
does
practice
it
further
he
must
understand
his
obligation
to
the
client
to
not
only
meet
his
physical
necessities
but
also
to
enhance
and
improve
his
life
and
to
enlarge
the
cultural
horizon
of
our
society
will
quarrel
with
the
aim
of
the
schools
or
with
the
wording
of
their
curriculum
is
in
the
quality
of
the
teaching
of
all
this
that
a
question
may
arise
old
established
independent
art
schools
try
their
best
to
fulfill
their
obligations
even
here
many
a
problem
is
presented
as
in
a
recent
design
competition
with
a
floor
plan
and
the
simple
command
design
a
luxury
apartment
no
description
of
the
client
or
his
cultural
level
no
assertion
of
geographical
area
or
local
social
necessities
simply
a
luxury
apartment
in
a
vacuum
of
minimal
information
can
result
only
in
show
pieces
that
look
good
in
exhibitions
and
catalogs
and
may
please
the
public
relations
department
but
have
little
to
do
with
the
essence
of
interior
design
is
possible
of
course
to
work
on
extant
or
projected
buildings
where
either
architect
or
owner
will
explain
their
necessities
so
that
the
student
may
get
the
feel
of
real
interior
design
demands
the
purely
synthetic
problem
is
the
rule
is
like
medical
schools
in
where
in
that
of
religious
inhibition
the
dissection
of
dead
bodies
is
frowned
upon
they
learn
their
dissection
on
the
bulbs
of
plants
technical
efficiency
is
achieved
at
the
expense
of
actual
experience
the
earlier
years
of
training
certain
phases
of
the
work
must
be
covered
and
the
synthetic
problem
has
its
use
to
continue
to
divorce
advanced
students
from
reality
is
inexcusable
with
architects
clients
real
estate
men
fabric
houses
and
furniture
companies
is
essential
to
the
proper
development
of
class
problems
just
as
in
actual
work
although
only
a
few
years
ago
they
held
the
student
at
arms
length
today
the
business
houses
welcome
the
opportunity
to
aid
the
student
not
only
from
an
increased
sense
of
community
responsibility
but
also
from
the
realization
that
the
student
of
today
is
the
interior
designer
of
tomorrow
that
the
student
already
is
in
the
trade
the
history
of
furniture
can
hardly
be
taught
exclusively
from
photographs
and
lantern
slides
too
the
reality
of
actual
furniture
must
be
experienced
professional
organizations
such
as
of
of
and
various
trade
associations
can
and
do
aid
greatly
in
this
work
every
educator
involved
in
interior
design
should
be
a
member
and
active
in
the
work
of
one
of
these
organizations
only
should
every
educator
above
the
rank
of
instructor
be
expected
to
be
a
member
of
one
of
the
professional
organizations
but
his
first
qualification
for
membership
as
an
educator
should
be
so
sharply
scrutinized
that
membership
would
be
equivalent
to
certification
to
teach
the
subject
for
the
educator
in
this
case
however
would
have
to
be
raised
to
full
and
complete
membership
largest
of
these
organizations
at
present
denies
to
the
full
time
educator
any
vote
on
the
conduct
and
standards
of
the
group
and
indeed
refuses
him
even
the
right
to
attach
the
customary
initials
after
his
name
in
the
college
catalog
anomalous
status
of
the
educator
cannot
fail
to
lower
his
standing
in
the
eyes
of
the
students
professor
in
turn
dares
not
tolerate
the
influence
in
his
classes
of
an
organization
in
the
policies
and
standards
of
which
he
has
no
voice
seems
somewhat
shortsighted
since
if
the
absolute
educational
qualifications
for
membership
which
the
organizations
profess
are
ever
enforced
the
educator
will
have
the
molding
of
the
entire
profession
in
his
hands
one
way
the
and
do
a
disservice
to
the
schools
is
in
the
continuance
of
the
grandfather
clauses
in
their
membership
requirements
these
groups
were
first
formed
many
prominent
and
accomplished
decorators
could
not
have
had
the
advantage
of
school
training
since
interior
design
courses
were
rare
and
undeveloped
during
their
youth
hard
years
of
on
the
job
training
had
brought
them
to
their
competence
necessity
of
that
day
has
long
disappeared
is
plenty
of
opportunity
for
proper
education
today
is
discouraging
for
students
to
realize
that
the
societies
do
not
truly
uphold
the
standards
for
which
they
are
supposed
to
stand
reason
and
the
day
of
grandfather
clauses
has
long
since
passed
one
can
deny
that
these
back
door
admissions
to
membership
provisions
have
been
seriously
abused
nor
that
they
have
not
resulted
in
the
admission
of
downright
incompetents
to
membership
in
supposedly
learned
societies
any
question
of
curriculum
and
approach
to
subject
must
be
the
quality
of
the
teachers
themselves
will
occur
to
anyone
that
the
teacher
must
have
adequate
education
a
depth
and
breadth
of
knowledge
far
beyond
the
immediate
necessities
of
his
course
plus
complete
dedication
to
his
subject
and
to
his
students
local
decorator
who
rushes
in
for
a
few
hours
of
teaching
may
but
more
likely
may
not
have
these
qualifications
will
the
hack
the
still
found
in
some
of
the
smaller
art
schools
suffice
a
few
years
ago
a
middle
western
college
circulated
a
request
for
a
teacher
of
interior
design
the
end
of
its
letter
was
the
information
that
applicants
for
this
position
must
also
be
prepared
to
teach
costume
design
and
advertising
art
kind
of
irresponsibility
toward
their
students
can
scarcely
build
a
strong
professional
attitude
in
the
future
designer
must
build
a
corps
of
highly
professional
teachers
of
interior
design
who
have
had
education
experience
in
the
profession
and
are
willing
to
take
on
the
usual
accompaniments
of
teaching
minimal
income
and
minimal
status
among
their
confreres
specialization
in
teaching
subjects
such
as
architecture
furniture
design
textiles
and
color
is
also
desirable
all
degree
courses
in
interior
design
a
number
of
academic
or
general
studies
courses
are
included
is
only
fair
to
demand
that
teachers
of
courses
in
history
psychology
and
so
on
be
as
well
informed
in
matters
of
art
especially
interior
design
as
are
the
art
teachers
educated
in
the
academic
subjects
proper
correlation
of
the
art
with
the
academic
can
be
achieved
only
if
this
standard
is
observed
matter
of
sympathy
of
the
academic
professors
for
art
objectives
also
must
be
taken
into
account
technical
question
of
school
organization
comes
to
mind
here
proper
accreditation
of
schools
teachers
in
any
course
must
have
a
degree
at
least
one
level
above
that
for
which
the
student
is
a
candidate
there
are
almost
no
schools
in
the
country
offering
graduate
work
in
interior
design
this
rule
cannot
at
present
be
observed
it
has
only
been
a
matter
of
the
last
few
years
that
reputable
schools
of
art
have
granted
degrees
at
all
question
however
cannot
be
ignored
for
long
basic
problem
involved
is
that
a
college
setting
up
a
graduate
school
must
have
an
entirely
separate
faculty
for
the
advanced
degree
professors
in
the
course
must
naturally
again
have
a
higher
degree
than
the
course
offers
solution
is
the
aquisition
of
degrees
in
education
but
it
is
a
poor
substitute
is
a
sort
of
academic
and
you
solve
it
brings
us
to
the
question
of
accreditation
of
art
schools
in
general
the
independent
art
schools
that
is
those
not
connected
with
any
university
or
college
receive
severe
and
separate
investigation
before
accreditation
by
the
various
regional
organizations
has
been
the
custom
for
most
universities
to
stretch
the
blanket
of
accreditation
for
their
liberal
arts
school
to
cover
the
shivering
body
of
their
fine
arts
department
plus
the
habit
of
many
schools
of
simply
adding
interior
design
to
the
many
subjects
of
their
home
economics
department
yet
nevertheless
claiming
that
they
teach
interior
design
has
contributed
to
the
low
repute
of
many
university
courses
in
interior
design
spite
of
this
many
universities
offer
adequate
and
even
distinguished
courses
in
the
subject
will
be
no
mitigation
of
these
offences
until
all
art
schools
whether
independent
or
attached
to
universities
have
separate
accreditation
as
do
medical
schools

of
lasting
importance
they
keep
coming
are
a
half
dozen
reasons
helping
to
account
for

more

the
more

and
it
is
helping
more
see
more
of
the
country
than
they
ever
saw
before
make
no
mistake
about
it
the
first
reason
people
turn
to
camping
is
one
of
economy
is
the
promise
of
a
vacation
trip
they
can
afford
computing
the
cost
for

people

up

then
splits
it
down
this
way
for

for

for

and

and
for
tips
and
miscellaneous
does
the
camping
couple
do
to
this
set
of
figures
for
lodging
they
save
they
prepare
their
own
meals
they
also
keep
in
their
pockets
a
good
portion
of
that
food
bill
along
with
most
of
the
tip
money
automobile
expenses
are
about
the
only
vacationing
cost
they
either
eliminate
or
pare
down
drastically
by
camping
along
the
way
used
to
think
of
a
single
vacation
each
summer
they
now
think
about
how
many
vacations
they
can
have
weekends
enable
many
to
get
away
from
home
for
three
or
four
days
several
times
a
year
even
if
they
stay
in
resorts
part
of
the
time
they
might
if
the
right
salesman
gets
them
in
tow
develop
a
yearning
to
spice
the
usual
vacation
fare
with
a
camping
trip
into
the
wide
open
spaces
would
be
a
mistake
to
sell
those
thousands
of
beginning
campers
on
the
idea
buying
the
comforts
of
home
not
is
the
place
to
find
the
comforts
of
home
buying
fun
and
adventure
and
family
experiences
it
would
also
be
a
mistake
for
them
not
to
realize
how
comfortable
camping
has
become
is
no
longer
a
way
of
life
for
the
bearded
logger
and
the
wandering
cowboy
campers
want
comforts
and
they
have
them
this
helps
explain
why
so
many
people
are
now
going
camping
fun
and
easy
so
easy
that
there
is
time
left
after
cooking
and
tent
keeping
for
the
women
to
get
out
and
enjoy
outdoor
fun
with
their
families
meals
are
no
great
problem
are
beds
thanks
to
air
mattresses
and
sleeping
bags
are
shelters
because
there
is
one
to
meet
the
needs
of
every
camper
or
prospective
camper
there
is
still
the
sometimes
complex
problem
of
helping
campers
choose
the
best
equipment
for
their
individual
needs
history
the
man
who
showed
superior
performance
has
become
the
commander
of
others
for
good
or
bad
the
when
factories
emerged
this
classical
pattern
has
been
followed
recently
have
always
been
tales
of
disillusionment
the
competent
technician
who
became
an
administrator
willingly
or
not
and
found
he
like
it
the
scientist
who
rebelled
against
the
personnel
and
paper
work
and
much
more
commonly
in
recent
years
the
engineer
who
found
that
other
duties
interfered
with
or
eliminated
his
engineering
contributions
have
been
many
extremely
competent
men
who
have
been
converted
into
very
incompetent
managers
or
submerged
in
paper
work
to
their
own
and
the
dissatisfaction
and
loss
has
been
more
evident
since
our
products
have
incorporated
astronomically
increased
technology
remedies
have
been
many
and
varied
attempts
to
teach
management
techniques
either
in
plant
at
special
schools
or
in
university
crash
courses
provision
of
assistants
or
associates
the
realization
has
been
growing
that
these
are
not
the
complete
answer
men
have
no
talent
for
or
interest
in
management
forcing
them
into
management
can
only
create
trouble
old
shop
adage
still
holds
good
mechanic
is
usually
a
bad
boss
our
economy
clings
inexorably
to
recognition
of
managerial
status
as
the
gage
of
success
fights
to
change
its
collar
from
blue
to
white
grades
of
management
seek
more
resounding
titles
and
incomes
because
of
social
pressures
several
recent
books
have
we
have
become
the
most
nation
in
the
world
can
be
done
for
the
individual
contributor
who
is
extremely
important
and
likely
to
be
more
so
in
the
operation
of
the
technically
oriented
company
is
usually
conscious
of
the
social
pressures
at
home
and
outside
usually
concerned
about
belief
that
attainment
and
success
are
measured
in
dollars
and
titles
titles
are
traditionally
given
only
to
management
men
and
income
tends
to
rise
with
title
the
college
professor
in
has
been
affected
is
as
one
engineer
says
indeed
a
difficult
thing
for
the
engineer
to
accept
that
he
can
go
as
far
on
his
technical
merit
as
he
could
employing
managerial
skills
difficulty
arises
even
though
we
can
give
examples
of
men
who
have
actually
followed
this
course
leads
one
to
conclude
as
you
have
that
there
is
inevitably
more
prestige
in
a
management
position
in
the
minds
of
our
people
should
be
more
able
to
answer
the
questions
on
this
score
than
engineering
and
chief
engineers
we
asked
such
men
in
major
companies
in
the
design
field
to
offer
their
opinions
on
the
problem
and
more
importantly
their
solutions
the
paragraphs
that
follow
we
quote
from
men
who
are
identified
on
the
final
page
what
title
what
setup
the
more
familiar
plans
for
advancement
is
that
of
is
not
a
mutually
exclusive
plan
there
is
no
one
point
in
a
career
at
which
he
must
select
either
the
technical
or
the
managerial
path
upward
the
management
path
does
not
open
the
door
to
higher
opportunities
than
are
offered
by
the
more
technical
path
is
common
to
shift
back
and
forth
working
up
through
a
number
of
supervisory
and
positions
there
are
a
number
of
positions
in
both
operating
departments
and
in
the

operation
that
are
filled
by
men
with
successful
managerial
experience
who
are
currently
broadening
their
capabilities
moving
into
a
managerial
position
does
not
necessarily
end
a
recognition
as
a
technical
expert

recognized
as

side

the

upon

and
actual
belief
in
the
policy
on
the
part
of

as
will
be
abundantly
apparent
in
subsequent
quotations
factor
that
may
hold
hope
is
for
parallel
recognition
is
as
one
man
says
it
that
the
fad
for
educating
top
people
along
managerial
lines
is
yielding
to
the
technically
trained

expectation
is
that

equal

with
very
few
coming
from

company
expects
to
extend

both

probably
not
into

this

about

of

do
not
have
people
in

termed

fellows
who
are
specialists
in
one
particular
technical
subject
suppose
it
is
because
we

just
not

enough
have
a
few

retired

retained

called
in
on
certain

only
fellows
in

are
those
who
have
been
honored
by
or
am
sure
that
the
engineer
who
enters
management
is
nearly
always
opening
the
door
to
greater
possibilities
than
he
would
have
as
a
technical
specialist
because
of
his
wider
accountability
structure

tried
to
make
both
paths
attractive
so
that
good
men
could
find
opportunity
and
satisfaction
in
either
way
to
formalize
this
is
in
the

structure
have
these
positions
which
compare
directly
these

we
have
chief

for

of

include
major

responsibilities
and
have
been
filled
by
those
who
have
come
up
primarily
through
the
side
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
establishing
recognition
of
technical
specialization
comparable
to
our
higher
levels
of

but
believe
we
will
trend
in
this
direction
but
not
to
exceed
job
research
scientist
four
years
ago
we
initiated
a
dual
ladder
of
advancement
for
technical
persons
highest
position
is
known
as
a
research
scientist
approach
has
not
been
entirely
satisfactory
primary
deterrent
appears
to
lie
with
the
technical
people
themselves
and
their
concept
of
what
constitutes
status
in
society
who
agitate
hardest
for
technical
recognition
are
often
the
most
reluctant
to
accept
it
have
discovered
that
the
outward
trappings
such
as
private
offices
and
private
secretaries
are
extremely
important
and
although
we
have
attempted
to
provide
these
status
symbols
support
of
the
plan
has
been
despite
the
creation
of
a
salary
potential
for
a
research
scientist
commensurate
with
that
of
men
in
top
managerial
positions
serious
problem
accompanying
the
approach
is
the
difficulty
of
clearly
defining
responsibilities
and
standards
of
performance
for
each
level
no
set
standards
there
is
the
tendency
to
promote
to
the
next
highest
level
when
the
top
of
a
salary
band
is
reached
regardless
of
performance
is
too
often
based
on
longevity
and
time
in
salary
grade
instead
of
merit
no
specific
organization
plan
exists
limiting
the
number
of
scientists
at
each
salary
level
the
result
is
a
department
with
personnel
engineer
manager
have
two
approaches
for
the
technical
man
the
position
of
staff
engineer
which
is
rated
as
high
in
salary
as
department
manager
and
an
administrative
organization
to
take
the
routine
load
away
from
department
managers
and
project
engineers
as
much
as
possible
thus
allowing
them
more
time
for
strictly
technical
work
are
only
halfway
measures
and
the
answer
will
come
when
some
way
is
found
to
allow
the
technical
man
in
industry
to
progress
without
limit
in
salary
and
prestige

that
the

to
the

can
result
entirely
from

the
difficulty
of

the
fact
that

of
a
central
tank
with
lines
to
each
house
is
not
in
itself
a
novelty
a
year
goes
by
but
what
several
local
companies
in
the
and
even
overseas
write
to
to
inquire
if
feasible
and
where
it
is
being
done
editors
only
knew
of
one
example
to
point
to
a
public
housing
development
of
homes
in
described
by
in
the
issue
has
survived
the
years
but
there
has
been
considerable
concern
among
the
tenants
over
the
fact
that
the
oil
was
not
metered
the
monthly
total
consumption
was
divided
and
charged
on
the
basis
of
number
of
rooms
and
persons
in
the
family
complaints
included
leaving
her
windows
open
all
the
time
a
fresh
air
fan
or
the
family
was
visiting
with
the
house
shut
up
but
they
still
paid
the
same
rate
for
oil
a
result
of
that
attitude
others
have
been
discouraged
from
trying
central
distribution
new
low
capacity
meter
is
the
key
that
unlocks
the
situation
at
a
meter
it
was
designed
for
this
job
by
of
a
key
individual
being
has
acquired
its
exclusive
distribution
for
the
northern
principal
heating
states
an
advantage
in
having
a
firm
like
headed
by
a
lawyer
earlier
development
was
public
housing
so
it
easily
leaped
over
the
problems
met
in
a
private
venture
have
to
do
with
property
rights
municipal
official
attitudes
and
a
host
of
others
working
out
the
practical
legal
conclusions
was
not
thinking
only
of
this
pilot
project
for
it
is
planned
to
duplicate
this
program
or
system
in
other
builder
developments
nationally
is
always
difficult
or
at
least
to
get
approval
of
any
kind
of
line
under
a
public
street
as
one
example
overcome
this
the
builder
lays
and
completes
the
street
himself
then
deeds
it
to
the
community
while
retaining
a
perpetual
easement
for
the
oil
lines
a
family
buys
a
home
the
title
is
subject
to
a
perpetual
easement
to
the
central
storage
buys
one
acre
its
tanks
and
simply
holds
permanent
title
to
that
piece
other
words
the
whole
storage
and
pipeline
system
does
not
belong
to
the
homeowners
nor
to
the
town
but
rather
to
does
get
its
revenue
from
this
plan
leases
the
whole
facility
to
a
large
oil
company
at
least
large
enough
to
have
a
strong
credit
position
first
test
is
being
leased
for
ten
years
but
future
projects
will
require
at
least
years
amount
paid
by
the
oil
company
to
for
the
use
of
its
oil
distribution
system
and
the
privilege
of
supplying
all
the
homes
is
subject
to
negotiation
but
naturally
must
be
profitable
to
both
parties
this
first
venture
the
central
storage
is
gallons
in
two
tanks
or
an
average
of
gallons
for
each
of
the
homes
supplier
delivers
at
his
convenience
in
transport
loads
so
as
to
maintain
weeks
reserve
supply
against
weather
contingencies
that
is
not
all
he
has
to
do
must
undertake
complete
servicing
of
the
oilheating
equipment
to
assure
fine
heating
the
present
project
the
heating
is
by
circulating
hot
water
from
units
with
domestic
hot
water
hookups
the
oil
man
must
read
the
meters
at
such
intervals
as
he
finds
best
this
first
development
the
supplier
signing
the
lease
is
a
major
oil
company
but
in
turn
the
deal
is
being
transferred
for
operation
to
its
local
fueloil
distributor
major
gets
the
assured
gallonage
for
the
life
of
the
lease
and
the
distributor
apparently
can
do
well
because
delivery
cost
is
low
considerations
officers
of
the
new
corporation
have
naturally
explored
many
angles
as
well
as
personalities
that
might
be
affected
example
the
officials
of
town
township
where
the
project
is
located
think
highly
of
it
because
it
simplifies
their
snow
clearing
problem
central
storage
is
near
a
main
artery
quite
easy
to
reach
with
large
transports
on
a
short
crescent
swing
with
fewer
trucks
in
the
residential
streets
has
ruled
that
this
is
not
a
public
utility
subject
to
their
many
regulations
financial
institutions
both
banks
and
insurance
companies
have
been
sounded
out
like
it
and
would
supply
most
of
the
capital
because
of
the
long
term
leases
by
strong
oil
companies
housing
agencies
consider
it
feasible
with
one
special
stipulation
must
be
a
restriction
in
the
deed
to
provide
that
the
customer
may
not
be
charged
more
than
the
current
market
price
for
the
oil
an
obvious
precaution
since
the
account
is
permanently
wedded
just
like
with
gas
or
electricity
a
few
details
of
the
system
the
lines
are
a
product
of
and
all
lines
are
welded
are
laid
a
minimum
of
deep
and
in
some
areas
four
feet
down
particularly
under
roads
to
stay
clear
of
all
other
piping
such
as
water
and
sewers
and
to
minimize
shocks
from
heavy
trucking
meter
is
mounted
high
on
the
basement
wall
figures
are
a
half
inch
high
and
very
easy
to
read
even
into
tenth
gallons
will
accommodate
firing
rates
as
low
as
a
half
gallon
an
hour
the
builder
is
convinced
that
the
total
cost
of
all
the
heating
systems
plus
the
oil
distribution
system
is
no
greater
than
would
be
gas
heating
systems
in
the
houses
plus
their
lines
and
meters
believes
that
this
is
a
sound
approach
to
gas
competition
in
builder
developments
where
gas
is
available
would
be
pretty
difficult
to
install
a
system
in
old
neighborhoods
and
an
understatement
job
of
getting
property
easements
and
street
easements
and
the
acre
for
the
tanks
would
become
pretty
discouraging
in
a
new
development
where
everything
starts
from
scratch
the
solutions
are
simple
plans
does
actually
want
to
do
now
that
it
has
the
meters
under
franchise
and
certain
phases
of
its
piping
system
in
the
patent
applied
for
stage
wants
to
interest
builders
and
oil
companies
in
the
idea
of
including
its
facility
in
their
new
home
projects
by
financing
and
installing
the
storage
piping
and
meters
and
leasing
these
for
years
with
renewal
options
to
a
strong
oil
company
may
also
work
in
one
other
way
by
licensing
its
system
patents
and
supplying
the
meters
letting
the
oil
company
or
even
the
builder
install
the
facilities
whole
development
is
certain
to
be
of
interest
to
the
readers
for
the
idea
has
so
often
been
mentioned
somewhat
wistfully
too

that

plastics

now
account
for
more
than
of
all

sales
years
ago
they

with
the
remainder
firmly
entrenched
in
the
stronghold
of

from

sources
are
now
estimating
that
of
the

made
during
the

be
of
plastic
construction
of
this
trend
can
best
be
seen
in
the
recent
activities
of
such
leading
companies
in
the
field
as
years
ago
the
entire
line
was
devoted
to
neon

today

in

the

standpoint
the
total
market
represented
by
the

industry
is
impressive

approximately
million
there
are
some
companies
in
the
field
ranging
from
small
firms
with
a
handful
of
employees
to
major
concerns
having
complete
facilities
for

the
trend
to
plastics
accounts
for
the
rapid
growth
of
plastics
in
the
sign
and
display
field
of
many
factors
which
might
be
cited
five
are
most
important
combine
such
properties
as
color
light
weight
optional
transparency
or
translucency
resistance
to
corrosion
as
well
as
the
ease
of
fabrication
signs
are
economical
to
one
major
producer
materials
for
a
typical
plastic
sign
are
approximately
less
costly
than
for
a
comparable
neon
unit
cost
is
also
reduced
a
plastic
sign
weighs
about
compared
to
for
neon
weight
advantage
plus
greater
durability
of
the
plastic
unit
yields
a
saving
of
about
in
shipping
lighter
weight
also
means
less
costly
supports
and
mountings
are
needed
maintenance
costs
on
plastic
signs
are
much
lower
than
on
fragile
neon
signs
offer
exceptional

it
possible
to

signs
also
show
versatility
in
other
directions
used
by

panels
are
printed
one

as
are

the

can
be
applied

faces
they
can
also
be
applied
to
opaque

for
use
on
cutouts
or
they
can
be
applied
directly
to

faces
this
way
the
sign
maker
has
an
economical
means
for
displaying
uniform
copy
on
different
sign
media
unveiled
another
new
development
made
possible
by
modern
plastic
materials
a
revolving
spectacular
sign
of
triangular
plastic
sections
it
makes
it
possible
to
combine
three
different

in
a
single

triangles
automatically
revolve
in
a

permits
of

letters
fill
many
needs
the
best
way
to
indicate
the
versatility
of
design
that
characterizes
the
use
of
plastics
in
signs
and
displays
would
be
to
look
at
what
is
happening
in
only
one
of
the
areas
in
this
complex
field
changeable
signs
are
meant
to
convey
a
message
and
in
most
cases
this
requires
words
and
letters
the
message
must
be
changed
at
intervals
to
feature
new
products
price
changes
huge
market
for
changeable
signs
has
spurred
a
universal
demand
for
individual
plastic
letters
in
all
shapes
and
sizes
and
a
number
of
companies
are
set
up
to
supply
them
are
some
of
the
newer
items
currently
available
a
changeable

sign
which
consists
of
an
extruded
impact
styrene

in
choice
of

onto
which
are
mounted
letters

or
other
types
of

which
is
available
in
various
widths

there
are
other
techniques
example
in
a
typical
store
installation
fifty
and
six
red
acrylic
letters
were
mounted
against
a
white
painted
wood
background
fact
that
even
the
larger
letters
weighed
only
each
made
it
possible
to
secure
the
letters
to
the
building
through
clear
acrylic
angle
brackets
cemented
to
the
letters
steel
screws
were
used
to
minimize
corrosion
stains
mounting
to
corrugated
plastic
backgrounds
very
small
holes
may
be
drilled
in
the
sides
of
the
letters
and
stainless
steel
wire
threaded
through
the
openings
its
ends
twisted
behind
the
panels
letters
are
also
available
for
sign
installations
for
example
supplies

in
several
colors
in
heights

inches
are
molded
of
a
special
formulation
of
butyrate
available

shaped
in
cross
section
to
provide
a
secure
fit
for
the
tapered
slots
molded

another
approach
to
the
changeable
letter
type
of
sign
is
a
modular
unit
introduced
by
vacuum
formed
sign
is
comprised
of
or
smaller
panels
formed
of
clear
butyrate
sheet
stock
masked

signs
are
produced
by
sliding
the
separate
letter
panels
into
channels
of
aluminum
which
may
be
mounted
to
various
surfaces
sheets
are
extruded
of
butyrate
by
units
where
additional
structural
requirements
are
imposed
one
recent
approach
utilizes
modular
extruded
or
formed
channels
corrugations
of
the
acrylic
or
butyrate
side

such
channels
make
possible
construction

type
of

the

cuts
the

because
it
unloads
in
a
fraction

at

unloading
it
helps
the

yourself
behind
the
wheel
of
a
car
and
head
for
the
open
road
those
who
need
or
want
and
can
afford
another
car
buying
one
and
driving
it
on
the
grand
tour
then
shipping
it
home
is
one
popular
plan
for
a
pilgrimage
of
course
there
are
those
of
us
who
either
do
not
want
or
need
or
cannot
afford
another
car
answer
to
this
diathesis
is
to
pick
up
a
telephone
and
arrange
to
rent
one
is
that
elemental
any
travel
agent
will
reserve
a
car
for
you
can
call
one
of
the
car
rental
services
directly
and
others
and
ask
them
to
reserve
a
car
of
your
choice
and
some
transportation
lines
offer
this
service
as
well
few
exceptions
your
car
will
be
waiting
for
you
at
dockside
airport
railroad
station
or
hotel
when
you
arrive
oftentimes
at
no
additional
cost
can
wait
of
course
until
you
arrive
in
before
renting
your
car
disadvantages
to
this
method
are
that
you
may
not
have
as
great
a
choice
of
models
readily
available
or
you
may
have
to
wait
a
few
days
or
during
the
busy
tourist
season
when
cars
are
in
great
demand
you
might
find
it
fairly
difficult
to
get
a
car
at
all
charges
are
relatively
the
same
reserving
a
car
before
you
leave
for
will
assure
you
of
having
one
on
tap
when
you
want
it
those
who
plan
to
travel
to
by
one
route
and
return
by
another
some
agencies
offer
a
service
whereby
you
can
pick
up
a
car
in
one
city
on
arrival
and
leave
it
in
another
city
or
even
another
country
when
you
are
ready
to
return
home
some
cities
this
and
delivery
service
is
without
additional
charge
and
if
you
are
when
you
are
planning
your
itinerary
you
will
take
advantage
of
these
free
delivery
and
collection
stations
in
major

within
the
larger

are
usually
provided
with

are

valid

is
accepted
in
all
countries
except
and
you
plan
to
visit
any
of
these

you
can
obtain
your

you
leave
at
a
nominal

around
insurance
too
with
most
agencies
is
provided
with
the
car
covering
comprehensive
fire
theft
liability
and
collision
with
a
deductible
clause
which
varies
in
different
countries
you
would
feel
happier
with
full
collision
insurance
there
is
a
small
additional
charge
again
varying
from
country
to
country
and
depending
on
the
term
of
such
insurance
average
charge
for
this
additional
insurance
coverage
is
roughly
a
day
charge
is
variable
however
and
goes
as
low
as
a
day
in
and
as
high
as
a
day
in
fees
are
variable
too
throughout
the
countries
of
are
as
many
rates
as
there
are
countries
and
models
of

available
in
the
there
is
a
flat
rental
charge
plus
a
few
cents
per

driven
and
the
rate
drops
if
the

is
retained
for
a
week
drops
again
after
fifteen
days
is
well
to
bear
in
mind
that
gasoline
will
cost
from

for
the
equivalent
of
a
gallon
and
while
you
might
prefer
a
familiar
or
even
a
which
are
available
in

countries
it
is
probably
wiser
to
choose
the
smaller
makes
which
average
thirty
and
even
forty
miles
to
the

choice
of
model
will
undoubtedly
be
governed
by
the
number
of
people
travelling
in
your
group
the
exception
of
the

even
the
quite
tiny

seat

if
you
are
willing
to
sacrifice
comfort
and

space
for
really
economical
transportation
is
a
large
variety
of
models
to
choose
from
in
most
countries
however
including

and
station
wagons
and
the
rental
fee
all
that
much
greater
than
for
the
wee

basic
costs
are
generally
pretty
much
the
same
regardless
of
the

you
reserve

of

will
be
well
worth
your

model
cars
are
not
available
in
all
countries
naturally
there
is
a
greater
availability
of
those
models
which
are
manufactured
within
a
specific
country
you
would
like
to
start
your
tour
in
where
the
rental
fees
are
actually
the
lowest
in
in
all
sizes
are
available
as
are

you
wish
to
budget
closely
on

saving
your
extra
dollars
to

one
agency
lists
the
small
at
only
a
day
plus
a
kilometer
and
the
seating
six
at
just
a
day
and
a
kilometer
you
will
be
using
your
car
more
than
fifteen
days
which
all
unlikely
the
daily
rates
drop
quite
sharply
to
a
day
for

and
to
an
infinitesimal
a

for
the

in
the

the
cost
comes
to
just
a
nickel
a

per

on
the
daily

the
majority
of
countries
however
the
rates
range
from
to
a
day
for
the
smaller

and
graduate
up
to
and
a
day
for
the
larger
luxury
models
with
the
rate
per
kilometer
driven
starting
at
and
going
up
as
high
as
same
model
car
might
be
available
in
six
or
eight
countries
yet
not
two
countries
will
have
the
same
rate
either
for
the
daily

or
rate
per

variations
are
not
too
great
for
cars
are
somewhat
higher
ranging
from
about
a

up
to
a

for
a
but
the
rate
per
kilometer
driven
is
roughly
the
same
as
for
the
larger
models
in
and
are
fairly
high
actually
the
highest
in
and
surprisingly
enough
they
are
also
quite
high
in
you
are
planning
to
tour
for
longer
than
a
month
it
might
be
wise
for
you
to
lease
a
car
actual
cost
for
the
first
month
will
perhaps
not
be
too
much
lower
than
the
rental
charges
for
the
same
period
of
time
but
you
will
receive
a
new

will
be
entitled
to
all
the
advantages
of
a
new

owner
which
includes
the

and
the

throughout
there
is
no
mileage
charge
or

when
you
lease
a

and
you
pay
only
the
flat
monthly
rate
plus
a
nominal
charge
for
documents
and
insurance
since
the

is
registered
and
insured
individually
for
your

a
fairly
wide

from
which
you

the
very
small

the
a
car
is
not
as
common
or
as
popular
as
renting
a
car
in
but
for
long
periods
it
will
be
unquestionably
more
economical
and
satisfactory
the
first
month
rates
are
considerably
less
averaging
only
about
a
month
for
most
and
models
are
reasons
for
some
people
not
wanting
to
rent
cars
and
going
on
the
plan
one
thing
the
driver
usually
sees
less
and
has
less
fun
than
his
passengers
since
it
becomes
pretty
necessary
for
him
to
keep
at
least
one
eye
on
the
road
too
drivers
have
reputations
for
being
somewhat
crazy
on
the
road
and
some
are
not
particularly
keen
on
getting
mixed
up
with
them
there
is
a
way
for
those
who
want
to
see
some
of
the
back
country
of
by
car
way
is
to
rent
a
car
as
expensive
as
most
people
believe
it
to
be
expenses
will
average
between
to
a
day
but
this
charge
is
the
same
whether
you
rent
a
limousine
or
a
or
big
spread
is
in
the
charge
for
each
kilometer
driven
being
governed
by
the
rate
at
which
gasoline
is
consumed
most
cars
average
more
miles
per
gallon
of
gasoline
than
cars
it
naturally
follows
that
the
cost
per
kilometer
for
these
models
will
be
less
but
the
greater
seating
capacity
of
the
large
cars
will
equalize
this
provided
your
group
is
sufficiently
large
to
fill
a
limousine
fees
for
the
rental
of
cars
vary
in
the
different
countries
in
the
same
manner
as
they
do
for
the
cars
whether
you
arrange
to
have
a
or
model
if
you
rent
a
car
with
the
proper
seating
capacity
in
relation
to
the
number
of
people
in
your
party
your
transportation
expense
will
average
very
close
to
per
day
per
passenger
will
include
your
helpful
chauffeur
and
a
drive
of
an
average
of
kilometers
in
any
one
day
you
drive
greater
distances
than
that
just
be
skimming
the
surface
and
will
never
discover
the
enchantment
fascination
and
beauty
which
lured
you
in
the
first
place
to
explore
the
hinterlands
course
if
you
want
to
throw
all
caution
to
the
winds
and
rent
an
or
limousine
just
for
you
and
your
bride
have
a
memorable
tour
but
it
be
cheap
and
it
is
not
recommended
unless
you
own
a
producing
oil
well
or
had
a
winner
in
the
romance
almost
nothing
rates
higher
than
what
the
movie
men
have
called
meeting
cute
that
is
seems
more
adorable
if
it
take
place
in
an
atmosphere
of
correct
and
acute
boredom
about
the
most
enthralling
example
of
meeting
cute
is
the
saga
reputedly
all
he
did
was
give
her
a
handful
of
peanuts
but
he
said
simultaneously
wish
they
were
emeralds
from
the
content
here
a
good
could
readily
pick
up
a
few
other
facts
especially
if
he
had
a
little
more
of
the
conversation
to
go
on
way
said
his
line
if
you
had
the
recorded
transcript
of
a
professional
linguist
would
probably
have
gone
like
this
stresses
on
emeralds
and
wish
note
pitch
pretty
high
on
emeralds
but
with
a
slight
degree
of
drawl
one
degree
of
oversoftness
people
involved
and
subsequent
facts
bear
me
out
here
knew
clearly
the
relative
values
of
peanuts
and
emeralds
both
monetary
and
sentimental
the
drawling
oversoft
voice
of
flirtation
though
fairly
overt
was
still
well
within
the
prescribed
gambit
of
their
culture
other
words
like
automation
machines
designed
to
work
in
tandem
they
shared
the
same
programming
a
mutual
understanding
not
only
of
words
but
of
the
four
stresses
pitches
and
junctures
that
can
change
their
meaning
from
black
to
white
this
point
unfortunately
romance
becomes
a
regrettably
small
part
of
the
picture
but
consider
if
you
can
bear
it
what
might
have
happened
if
for
some
perverse
undaunted
reason
had
made
the
same
remark
to
an
girl
in
her
peanuts
and
emeralds
would
have
been
just
so
much
blubber
point
quite
simply
is
this
words
they
might
have
had
but
communication
no
basic
principle
the
first
in
a
richly
knotted
bundle

conveyed

me

ingenious

peppery
rhythm

his

academic
career

speech
to
girls
a
project
considerably
enlivened
by
his
devotion
to
a
recording
about
a
young

never
could
make
up

they
might
encounter
in
remote
overseas
posts
that
he
first
began
to
develop
a
system
of
charting
the
norms
of
human
communication
the
trained
ear
of
the
linguist
talk
has
always
revealed
a
staggering
quantity
of
information
about
the
talker
such
things
as
geographical
origin
history
identity
education
is
only
fairly
recently
however
that
linguists
have
developed
a
systematic
way
of
charting
voices
on
paper
in
a
way
that
tells
even
more
about
the
speakers
and
about
the
success
or
failure
of
human
communication
between
two
people
for
obvious
reasons
makes
their
techniques
superbly
useful
in
studying
the

useful
in

that

to

joint
investigations
of

and
psychiatry
have
established
in
point
of
fact
that
no
matter
what
the
subject
of
conversation
is
or
what
words
are
involved
it
is
impossible
for
people
to
talk
at

over
again

they
are

they

interviewing

the
basic
therapeutic
and
diagnostic
instrument
of
modern
psychiatry
the
recording
of
interviews
for
playbacks
and
study
has
been
a
boost
of
proportions
in
new
research
and
training
of
the
earliest
recordings
made
in
the
demonstrated
that
psychiatrists
reacted
immediately
to
anger
and
anxiety
in
the
sound
track
whereas
written
records
of
the
same
interview
offered
far
fewer
cues
to
therapy
which
if
they
were
at
all
discernible
in
print
were
picked
up
only
by
the
most
skilled
and
sensitive
experts
a
general
way
psychiatrists
were
able
to
establish
on
a
wide
basis
what
many
of
them
had
always
felt
that
the
most
telling
cues
in
psychotherapy
are
acoustic
that
such
things
as
stress
and
nagging
are
transmitted
by
sound
alone
and
not
necessarily
by
words
a
minimum
recording
usually
on
tape
which
is
now
in
wide
professional
use
brings
the
psychiatric
interview
alive
so
that
the
full
range
of
emotion
and
meaning
can
be
explored
repeatedly
by
the
therapist
or
by
a
battery
of
therapists
to
this
battery
are
the
experts
in
linguistics
who
have
carried
that
minimum
to
a
new
level
adding
a
systematic
analysis
with
symbols
to
the
typed
transcripts
of
interviews
they
have
supplied

this

disapproval
or
surprise
which
would
set
the
patient
apart
from
other
people
patient
on
the
other
hand
is
far
from
neutral
aside
from
her
specifically
regional
accent
she
reveals
by
the
use
of
the
triad
irritable
tense
depressed
a
certain
pedantic
itemization
that
indicates
she
has
some
familiarity
with
literary
or
scientific
language
she
must
have
had
at
least
a
education
and
she
is
telling
a
story
she
has
mentally
rehearsed
some
time
before
she
catapults
into
everything
and
everybody
putting
particular
violence
on
everybody
indicating
to
the
linguist
that
this
is
a
spot
to
flag
that
is
it
is
not
congruent
to
the
general
style
of
speech
up
to
this
point
it
is
referred
to
the
therapist
for
attention
may
then
very
well
conclude
that
everybody
is
probably
not
the
true
target
of
her
resentment
thereafter
the
patient
fractures
her
rehearsed
story
veering
into
an
oversoft
breathy
sloppily
articulated
feel
like
talking
right
now
the
first
five
minutes
of
this
interview
it
is
apparent
to
the
therapist
that
everybody
truthfully
refers
to
the
husband
says
later
but
still
within
the
opening
five
minutes
keep
thinking
of
a
divorce
but
another
emotional
death
linguistic
and
paralinguistic
signals
of
misery
are
all
present
in
the
voice
chart
for
this
sentence
so
are
certain
signals
that
she
does
not
accept
divorce
saying
another
emotional
death
she
reveals
that
there
has
been
a
previous
one
although
she
has
not
described
it
in
words
the
therapist
may
pursue
in
later
questioning
phrase
emotional
death
interesting
and
to
a
mind
rather
touching
suggests
that
this
woman
may
have
some
flair
for
words
perhaps
even
something
of
the
temperament
regrettably
called
creative
the
psychiatric
interview
like
any
other
interview
depends
on
communication
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
therapist
in
this
interview
was
a
man
of
marked
skill
and
long
experience
own
communication
apparatus
operated
superbly
and
readers
will
note
instantly
its
total
lack
of
resemblance
to
the
blunted
monumentally
unmeshed
mechanism
of
enough
although
none
of
the
therapists
involved
could
conceivably
compare
with
when
groups
of
them
began
playing
back
interviews
they
discovered
any
number
of
ways
in
which
they
wanted
to
polish
their
own
interview
techniques
almost
everyone
on
first
hearing
one
of
his
own
sessions
on
tape
expressed
some
desire
to
take
the
whole
thing
over
again
in
spite
of
this
intensive
study
of
the
taped
interviews
by
teams
of
psychotherapists
and
linguists
laid
bare
the
surprising
fact
that
in
the
first
five
minutes
of
an
initial
interview
the
patient
often
reveals
as
many
as
a
dozen
times
just
wrong
with
him
to
spot
these
giveaways
the
therapist
must
know
either
intuitively
or
scientifically
how
to
listen
the
patient
does
not
say
hate
my
father
or
rivalry
is
what
bugs
me
he
does
do
is
give
himself
away
by
communicating
information
over
and
above
the
words
involved
of
the
classic
indicators
as
described
by
and
in
are
these
ambiguity
of
pronouns
or
repetition
of
you
he
she
et
cetera
may
signal
ambiguity
or
uncertainty
the
other
hand
significant
facts
may
be
concealed
she
may
mean
or
everybody
as
it
did
with
the
tense
and
irritable
woman
mentioned
before
may
refer
to
a
specific
person
word
that
is
not
used
can
be
as
important
as
the
word
that
is
used
therapist
linguist
must
always
consider
the
alternatives
someone
says
for
example
took
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
me
it
pays
to
consider
how
this
statement
would
normally
be
made
patient
in
actuality
was
a
neurasthenic
who
had
almost
come
to
the
point
of
accepting
the
fact
that
it
was
not
her
soma
but
her
psyche
that
was
the
cause
of
her
difficulty
linguists
note
here
that
in
stammered
when
he
spoke
of
his
wife
which
is
hardly
surprising
in
view
of
their
disastrous
relationship
was
just
another
freighter
from
the
and
she
seemed
as
commonplace
as
her
name
was
the
one
of
those
that
had
sailed
to
to
bring
beans
bombs
and
bullets

thought
of
the
it
was
to
observe
that
she
was
straddled
by
a
pair
of
ships
heavily
laden
with
high
explosive

if
they
were
hit
the
would
likely
be
blown
up
with
her

ammo

whatever
else
it

that
she

as
the

loose
upon
mankind
such
terrible
and
inhumane

been
accomplished
in
any
case
and
what
is
more
every
one
attempting
such
solution
has
found
that
in
most
cases
there
have
remained
a
great
many
components
of
the
dream
the
source
of
which
he
has
been
unable
to
explain
nor
is
the
discussion
closed
on
the
subject
of
the
mantic
or
prophetic
power
of
dreams
present
many
mysteries
of
telepathy
clairvoyance
prevision
and
retrovision
basic
mystery
of
dreams
which
embraces
all
the
others
and
challenges
us
from
even
the
most
common
typical
dream
is
in
the
fact
that
they
are
original
visual
continuities
recall
the
startling
vivid
realism
of
a
dream
in
which
lived
through
the
horror
of
the
bombing
of
a
little
town
am
sure
that
nothing
within
me
is
capable
of
composing
that
sequence
so
complete
in
detail
from
the
of
news
pictures
have
seen
when
psychology
explains
glibly
but
the
subconscious
mind
is
able
to
produce
it
it
refers
to
a
mental
region
so
vaguely
identified
that
it
may
embrace
the
entire
universal
mind
as
conceivably
as
part
of
the
individual
mind
may
deny
the
more
startling
phenomena
of
dreams
as
things
they
have
never
personally
observed
but
failure
to
wonder
at
their
basic
mystery
is
outright
avoidance
of
routine
evidence
question
becomes
is
a
dream
a
dream
simply
a
mental
or
cerebral
movie
dream
and
this
is
true
of
a
mental
image
of
any
type
even
though
it
may
be
readily
interpreted
into
its
equivalent
of
wakeful
thought
is
a
psychic
phenomenon
for
which
no
explanation
is
available
most
cases
we
recognize
certain
words
persons
animals
or
objects
these
are
dreamed
in
original
action
in
some
particular
continuity
which
we
remember
having
seen
in
real
life
instance
the
dreamer
sees
himself
seated
behind
neighbor
and
with
photographic
realism
sees
driving
the
car
whereas
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
that
cannot
drive
a
car
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
brain
can
alter
past
impressions
to
fit
into
an
original
realistic
and
unbroken
continuity
like
we
experience
in
dreams
entire
concept
of
cerebral
imagery
as
the
physical
basis
of
a
mental
image
can
find
no
logical
support
mental
image
subconsciously
impressing
us
from
beneath
its
language
symbols
in
wakeful
thought
or
consciously
in
light
sleep
is
actually
not
an
image
at
all
but
is
comprised
of
realities
viewed
not
in
the
concurrent
sensory
stream
but
within
the
depths
of
the
fourth
dimension
that
display
events
of
the
future
with
photographic
detail
call
for
a
theory
explaining
their
basic
mystery
and
all
its
components
including
that
weird
feeling
of
deja
vue
inevitably
fantastic
though
that
theory
must
seem
in
the
theory
of
perception
established
in
the
eye
is
recognized
as
an
integral
part
of
the
brain
then
this
theory
confesses
that
it
is
completely
at
a
loss
as
to
how
the
image
can
possibly
be
received
by
the
brain
opening
paragraph
of
the
chapter
titled
in
the
book
by
says
passed
on
to
the
brain
and
there
by
some
unexplained
process
it
causes
the
mind
to
have
a
perception
why
is
it
necessary
to
reproduce
the
retinal
image
within
the
brain
retinal
images
are
conceded
to
be
an
integral
function
of
the
brain
it
seems
logical
to
suppose
that
the
nerves
between
the
inner
brain
and
the
eyes
carry
the
direct
drive
for
cooperation
from
the
various
brain
centers
rather
than
to
theorize
on
the
transmission
of
an
image
which
is
already
in
required
location
the
external
object
viewed
by
the
eyes
remains
the
thing
that
is
seen
not
the
retinal
image
the
purpose
of
which
would
be
to
achieve
perceptive
cooperation
by
stirring
sympathetic
impulses
in
the
other
sensory
centers
motor
tensions
associated

symbols
and

physics

we
may
conceive
the

of
the
infinite
number
of
universal
apparently
momentary
states
of

successive
one
after
another
in

but
permanent
each
on

the
overwhelming
immensity
of

be
conceived
as
a
static
pulsation
through
an
enormous
number
of
coexistent
frequencies

perpetuate

the

however
bizarre

that

a

it

be
compounded
from
views
of

realities
although
some
of
them
may
never

encountered
in
what
we
are
pleased
to
call
the
real
life

at

that
a
priest
associated
with
the
king
escorted
him
to
the
treasure
chamber
of
the
temple
of
gave
him
six
novel
points
of
information
about
a

broken
relic
and
corrected
an
error
in
its
identification
a
matter
of
fact
the
incorrect
classification
the
result
of
many
weeks
of
labor
by
was
about
to
be

by
him
the
following
day

later
the
missing
part
of

relic
was
found
and
the
complete
inscription
together
with
other
new
evidence
fully
corroborated
the
ancient
information
was
uncertain
as
to
the
language
used
by
the
ancient
priest
in
his
dream
was
almost
positive
it
was
not
nor
and
imagined
it
must
have
been
or
may
conclude
that
all
six
points
of
information
ostensibly
given
by
the
dream
priest
could
have
been
furnished
by
subconscious
reasoning
in
denying
any
physical

for

how
could
the

possibly
compose
that
realistic
vividly
visual
continuity

by

theory
is

the

us
as
anything

there
are
notably
frequent
instances
of

in
which
our
recognition
of

a
feeling

make
toast
with

was
an
early
complaint
course
they
learned
in

that
they
not

could
use

but
the

liked
it
better

plenty
of

some
have
very
little
money

some
are

some
live
in
small

have
beautiful

some
not
even
a

have
serenity
of

the
ability
to
accept
what
they
have
and
make
the
most
of
it
a
wonderful
gift
to
have
believe
me
some
see
only
darkness
the
bitter
side
of
everything
whatever
you
have
it
got
to
learn
to
live
with

question
is
are
you
going

live
with
it
can
sit
back
and
moan
and
bewail
your

can
do
this
if
you
do
your
life
will
be
just
one
thing
unhappiness
complete
and
unabridged
seems
to
me
the
first
thing
got
to
do
to
be
happy
is
to
face
up
to
your
problems
no
matter
what
they
may
be
up
your
mind
to
pool
your
resources
and
get
the
most
out
of
your
remaining
years
of
life
thing
am
sure
of
you
must
get
an
interest
in
life
got
to
do
something
of
you
will
say
what
can
do
me
are
many
many
things
to
do
out
what
you
like
to
do
most
and
really
give
it
a
whirl
you
think
of
a
thing
to
do
try
something
anything
you
will
surprise
yourself
are
not
all
great
artists
frankly
draw
a
straight
line
you
are
not
that
gifted
either
but
how

women
can
sit
and
sew
crochet
tat
or
knit
by
the
hour
and
look
calm
and
relaxed
and
turn
out
beautiful
work
sewing
is
concerned
a
total
loss
you
see
a
needle
in
my
hands
you
will
know
the
family
buttons
have
fallen
off
and
have
to
sew
them
back
on
or
get
out
the
safety
pins
again
always
that
lovely
old
pastime
of
hooking
or
braiding
rugs
for
me
but
perhaps
just
the
thing
for
you
about
mosaic
tile
ceramics
or
similar
arts
and
crafts
people
love
to
crack
tile
and
amazing
what
beautiful
designs
they
come
up
with
as
a
result
of
their
cracking
good
time
about
the
art
of
cooking
you
yearn
to
make
cakes
and
pies
or
special
cookies
and
candies
is
always
an
open
market
for
this
sort
of
delicacy
in
spite
of
low
calorie
diets
cottage
cheese
and
to
the
contrary
people
can
carve
most
anything
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
make
beautiful
chairs
cabinets
chests
doll
houses
you
do
that
but
have
you
ever
tried
to
see
what
you
could
do
with
a
hunk
of
wood
of
cutting
your
fingers
maybe
you
would
come
up
with
nothing
at
all
but
then
again
you
might
turn
out
some
dandy
little
gadgets
women
get
a

a

choice
it

if

ambitious
since

you

is
just
being
a

let
the
rejection
slips
fall
where
they
may

keep
on
plugging
and
finally
you
will
make

that

does
cost
a

for

there
are
hobbies
that
are
for

about
a
rock
collection
or

am
holding

two
huge

love
puzzles
to
put
together
when
time
hangs
heavy
on
my
hands
far
the
covers
have
never
been
off
the
boxes
just
have
time
to
do
half
the
things
want
to
do
now
in
closing
fellow

advise
you
to
make
the
most
of
each
day
enjoy
each
one
to
the
degree
if
you
can
occupied
to
the
point
you
are
not
bored
with
life
and
you
will
truly
find
these
final
days
and
years
of
your
lives
to
be
sunshine
sweet
one
and
all
ahead
important
criterion
of
maturity
is
creativity
mature
person
is
creative
does
it
mean
to
be
creative
a
term
we
hear
with
increasing
frequency
these
days
we
turn
to
we
find
him
helpful
as
usual
be
creative
is
to
have
the
ability
to
cause
to
exist
to
produce
where
nothing
was
before
to
bring
forth
an
original
production
of
human
intelligence
or
power
are
creative
it
seems
when
we
produce
something
which
has
not
previously
existed
creativity
may
run
all
the
way
from
making
a
cake
building
a
chicken
coop
or
producing
a
book
to
founding
a
business
creating
a
of
or
developing
a
mature
character
living
creatures
from
the
lowest
form
of
insect
or
animal
life
evidence
the
power
of
creativity
if
it
is
only
to
reproduce
a
form
like
their
own
man
shares
this
procreative
function
with
all
his
predecessors
in
the
evolutionary
process
he
is
the
only
animal
with
a
true
and
conscious
creative
ability
animal
bird
or
insect
creates
either
a
burrow
or
nest
or
hive
in
unending
sameness
according
to
specie
great
superiority
over
these
evolutionary
forbears
is
in
the
development
of
his
imagination
gives
him
the
power
to
form
in
his
mind
new
image
combinations
of
old
memories
ideas
and
experiences
and
to
project
them
outside
of
himself
into
his
environment
in
new
and
forms
has
been
truly
said
that
anything
man
can
imagine
he
can
produce
or
create
by
projecting
this
inner
image
into
its
counterpart
in
the
objective
world
our
own
time
we
have
seen
the
most
fantastic
imagery
of
a
come
into
actuality
vision
of
a
expressed
in
a
poem
years
ago
took
visible
form
over
in
the
air
blitzes
of
fact
all
of
our
civilized
world
is
the
resultant
of
projection
of
his
imagination
over
the
past
centuries
or
more
is
in
this
one
aspect
at
least
that
man
seems
to
be
made
in
the
image
of
his
only
can
man
project
his
imagination
out
into
his
environment
in
concrete
forms
but
even
more
importantly
he
can
turn
it
inward
to
help
create
new
and
better
forms
of
himself
recognize
that
young
people
through
imaginative
mind
and
body
training
can
become
athletes
acrobats
dancers
musicians
and
artists
developing
many
potentialities
know
that
actors
can
learn
to
portray
a
wide
variety
of
character
roles
this
same
combination
of
the
will
and
the
imagination
each
one
of
us
can
learn
to
portray
permanently
the
kind
of
character
we
would
like
to
be
must
realize
with
in
his
that
is
the
being
that
can
continually
remake
himself
the
artisan
that
is
himself
the
material
for
his
own
creation
far
in
history
man
has
been
too
greatly
with
projecting
things
into
his
environment
rather
than
first
creating
the
sort
of
person
who
can
make
the
highest
use
of
the
things
he
has
created
not
the
present
world
crisis
a
race
between
things
we
have
created
which
can
now
destroy
us
and
between
populations
of
sufficient
wisdom
and
character
to
forestall
the
tragedy
it
not
the
obligation
of
us
older
citizens
to
lend
our
weight
to
being
creative
on
the
character
side
and
to
hasten
our
own
maturing
process
in
his
book
makes
the
novel
point
that
just
as
man
is
unique
in
being
the
only
animal
which
requires
a
long
period
of
infancy
and
childhood
under
family
protection
so
is
he
the
only
animal
who
has
a
long
period
after
the
decline
of
his
procreativity
recent
writings
assume
that
the
ignorant
young
couples
are
a
thing
of
the
remote
past
that
nowadays
all
honeymooners
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
best
and
know
enough
from
talk
with
friends
and
personal
experimentation
to
take
all
the
anxiety
and
hazards
out
of
the
situation
but
extensive
discussions
with
contemporary
practitioners
family
doctors
and
gynecologists
indicate
that
this
is
still
an
area
of
enormous
ignorance
and
talking
may
be
freer
and
easier
but
the
important
factual
information
is
still
lacking
for
far
too
many
men
and
women
factors
in
the
setting
can
still
be
of
great
advantage
in
making
the
first
intercourse
a
good
rather
than
a
bad
memory
for
one
or
both
must
be
highly
assured
both
in
time
and
place
is
locking
the
room
or
stateroom
door
gives
privacy
of
location
but
it
is
equally
important
to
be
sure
there
is
time
enough
for
an
utterly
unhurried
fulfillment
the
wedding
party
lasted
late
and
the
travel
schedule
means
there
are
only
a
few
hours
before
resuming
the
trip
or
making
an
early
start
the
husband
may
forestall
tensions
and
uncertainties
by
confiding
to
his
bride
that
lying
in
each
arms
will
be
bliss
enough
for
these
few
hours
consummation
should
come
at
the
next
stopping
place
when
they
have
a
long
private
time
day
or
night
for
that
purpose
intercourse
for
the
bride
brings
with
it
the
various
problems
connected
with
virginity
and
the
hymen
thing
should
be
clear
to
both
husband
and
wife
neither
pain
nor
profuse
bleeding
has
to
occur
when
the
hymen
is
ruptured
during
the
first
sex
act
on
this
point
has
caused
a
great
deal
of
needless
anxiety
misunderstanding
and
suspicion
hymen
is
in
essence
a
fragile
membrane
that
more
or
less
completely
covers
the
entrance
to
the
vagina
in
most
female
human
beings
who
have
not
had
sex
relations
in
fact
is
the
word
for
membrane
it
is
thin
and
fragile
and
gives
way
readily
to
the
male
organ
at
the
first
attempt
at
intercourse
might
be
expected
girls
in
this
situation
bleed
very
little
and
perhaps
not
at
all
in
the
process
of
losing
their
virginity
is
also
important
to
realize
that
many
girls
are
born
without
a
hymen
or
at
most
only
a
tiny
trace
of
one
so
that
the
absence
of
the
hymen
is
by
no
means
positive
proof
that
a
girl
has
had
sex
relations
there
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
the
exaggerations
of
the
beliefs
hymens
are
so
strongly
developed
that
they
cannot
be
torn
without
considerable
pain
to
the
girl
and
marked
loss
of
blood
rarely
the
hymen
is
so
sturdy
that
it
does
not
yield
to
penetration
cases
are
on
record
in
which
the
doctor
has
had
to
use
instruments
to
cut
through
the
hymen
to
permit
marital
relations
to
be
consummated
cases
for
all
their
rarity
are
so
dramatic
that
friends
and
relations
repeat
the
story
until
the
general
population
may
get
an
entirely
false
notion
of
how
often
the
hymen
is
a
serious
problem
to
recent
times
when
sexual
matters
began
to
be
discussed
more
scientifically
and
more
openly
the
emotional
aspects
of
virginity
received
considerable
attention
the
bridal
pair
has
many
adjustments
to
make
to
their
new
situation
it
necessary
to
add
to
the
other
tensions
the
hazard
of
making
the
loving
husband
the
one
who
brought
pain
to
his
bride
and
marriage
manuals
began
to
advise
that
the
bride
should
consult
a
physician
before
marriage
he
foresaw
any
problem
because
of
the
quality
of
the
hymen
it
was
recommended
that
simple
procedures
be
undertaken
at
once
to
incise
the
hymen
or
preferably
to
dilate
it
a
natural
outgrowth
of
this
approach
it
was
often
suggested
that
the
doctor
should
complete
the
preparation
for
painless
intercourse
by
dilating
the
vagina
recommendation
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
hymen
was
not
the
only
barrier
to
smooth
consummation
of
the
sex
act
vagina
is
an
organ
capable
of
remarkable
contraction
and
dilation
is
obvious
when
it
is
remembered
that
during
childbirth
the
vagina
must
dilate
enough
to
permit
the
passage
of
the
baby
intricate
system
of
muscles
that
manage
the
contraction
and
dilatation
of
the
vagina
are
partly
under
voluntary
control
an
instinctive
reflex
may
work
against
the
conscious
intention
of
the
woman
is
when
first
penetration
takes
place
the
pressure
and
pain
signals
may
involuntarily
cause
all
the
vaginal
muscles
to
contract
in
an
effort
to
bar
the
intrusion
and
prevent
further
pain
advantages
of
dilatation
by
the
physician
are
both
physical
and
psychological
it
is
a
purely
professional
situation
none
of
the
pain
is
associated
with
or
the
beloved
using
instruments
of
gradually
increasing
size
the
vagina
is
gently
and
with
minimum
pain
at
each
stage
taught
to
yield
to
an
object
of
the
appropriate
shape
this
process
the
vaginal
muscles
come
under
better
conscious
control
by
the
girl
learns
how
to
relax
them
to
accept
instead
of
contracting
them
to
repel
the
entering
object
from
the
standard
problem
of
controlling
the
vaginal
muscles
other
serious
barriers
may
exist
that
need
special
gynecological
treatment
is
far
better
to
have
such
conditions
treated
in
advance
than
to
have
them
show
up
on
the
honeymoon
where
they
can
create
a
really
serious
situation
no
medical
problems
exist
the
newly
married
couple
generally
prefer
to
cope
with
the
adjustments
of
their
new
relationship
by
themselves
information
and
guidance
about
the
possible
difficulties
are
still
of
great
value
superstition
and
remembered
passages
from
erotic
literature
can
create
physical
and
emotional
problems
if
blindly
taken
as
scientific
facts
and
useful
hints
importance
of
loving
tenderness
is
obvious
long
unhurried
approach
and
the
deliberate
prolongation
of
work
on
several
levels
the
excitement
of
caresses
and
sexual
stimulation
the
vagina
relaxes
and
dilates
and
the
local
moisture
greatly
increases
providing
an
excellent
lubricant
to
help
achieve
an
easier
penetration
observations
by
physicians
during
vaginal
examinations
have
established
the
fact
that
a
single
finger
inserted
along
the
anterior
wall
the
top
line
of
the
vagina
as
the
woman
lies
on
her
back
may
cause
a
great
deal
of
distress
in
a
virgin
during
the
same
examination
two
fingers
may
be
inserted
along
the
posterior
wall
the
bottom
of
the
vagina
in
the
same
position
without
any
pain
and
in
fact
without
any
difficulty
if
the
pressure
is
kept
downward
at
all
times
regional
differences
of
sensitivity
to
pain
may
be
of
crucial
significance
during
the
earliest
intercourse
husband
and
wife
should
start
with
this
anatomical
information
clearly
in
mind
may
then
adjust
their
positions
and
movements
to
avoid
too
much
pressure
on
the
urethra
and
the
anterior
wall
of
the
vagina
at
least
until
repeated
intercourse
has
dilated
it
and
pain
is
no
longer
a
possible
threat
against
the
full
pleasure
of
fact
the
technical
procedure
in
medical
examinations
may
be
wisely
adapted
to
his
romantic
purposes
by
the
husband
during
the
honeymoon
talk
often
stresses
the
idea
that
a
man
is
doing
the
girl
a
favor
if
he
is
forceful
and
ruthless
during
the
first
penetration
false
reasoning
is
that
a
gradual
advance
prolongs
the
pain
while
a
swift
powerful
act
gets
it
over
with
and
leaves
the
girl
pleased
with
his
virility
and
grateful
for
his
decisiveness
in
settling
the
problem
once
and
for
all
talk
is
seriously
in
error
at
this
time
can
be
a
very
severe
shock
to
the
bride
both
physically
and
psychologically
insistent
forceful
penetration
may
tear
and
inflame
the
vaginal
walls
as
well
as
do
excessive
damage
to
the
hymen
pain
and
distress
associated
with
the
performance
may
easily
give
the
wife
a
dread
of
marital
relations
and
cause
her
unconsciously
to
make
the
sex
act
unpleasant
and
difficult
for
both
by
exercising
her
vaginal
muscles
to
complicate
his
penetration
instead
of
relaxing
them
to
facilitate
it
attention
must
also
be
given
to
the
problems
in
the
honeymoon
situation
necessity
for
keeping
alert
to
his
hazards
can
act
as
an
interference
with
the
spontaneous
desire
emotional
stimulation
may
be
so
great
that
he
may
experience
a
premature
climax
is
a
very
common
experience
and
should
in
no
way
discourage
or
dishearten
either
husband
or
wife
the
frequent
need
to
check
and
discipline
himself
to
the
wisest
pace
of
the
consummation
can
put
him
off
stride
and
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
continuously
ready
for
penetration
over
a
long
period
signals
to
proceed
may
therefore
come
when
he
is
momentarily
not
able
to
take
advantage
of
them
best
course
is
to
recover
his
physical
excitement
by
a
change
of
pace
that
makes
him
ardent
again
may
require
imagination
and
reminding
himself
that
now
he
can
be
demanding
and
can
take
security
from
the
fact
that
the
progress
he
has
made
by
his
gentle
approach
will
not
be
lost
while
he
uses
talk
caresses
or
requires
caresses
from
her
his
bride
will
sympathetically
understand
the
situation
and
eagerly
help
him
restore
his
physical
situation
so
they
can
have
the
consummation
they

information
on
this
point
shows
that
first
intercourse
even
when
it
is
achieved
with
minimum
pain
or
difficulty
is
seldom
an
overwhelming
sexual
experience
to
a
woman
many
new
things
are
happening
for
it
to
be
a
complete
erotic
fulfillment
under
rare
circumstances
would
a

experience
an
orgasm
during
her
first
intercourse
man
and
wife
should
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
a
lack
of
climax
and
even
the
absence
of
the
anticipated
keen
pleasure
are
not
a
sign
that
the
wife
may
be
cold
or
frigid
the
early
approaches
are
wise
understanding
and
patient
the
satisfactions
of
marital
fulfillment
will
probably
be
discovered

with
ourselves
this
is
a
clue
to
the
amazing
variety
and
power
of
reactions
attitudes
and
emotions
precipitated
by
the
nude
form
wide
divergence
of
reactions
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
studies
in
human
sexuality
were
related
to
social
economic
and
educational
backgrounds
persons
of
eighth
grade
education
or
less
were
more
apt
to
avoid
or
be
shocked
by
nudity
those
educated
beyond
the
eighth
grade
increasingly
welcomed
and
approved
nudity
in
sexual
relations
understanding
helps
to
explain
why
one
matron
celebrating
years
of
married
life
could
declare
with
some
pride
that
her
husband
had
never
seen
her
entirely
naked
while
another
woman
boasting
an
equal
number
of
years
of
married
life
is
proud
of
having
shared
the
nudist
way
of
life
the

the

equally

the

of
beauty
and

is
always
a
little
surprised
to
bump
into
such
individual
distinctions
when
it
is
unexpected
still
recall
the
mild
shock
experienced
in

an
enthusiastic
advocate
of

experts
say
that
such
mutual

and
mutual
joy
are
seldom

one
partner

the
other
dominates
the
sexual
relationship
the
past
it
has
been
the
husband
who
has
been
dominant
and
the
wife
passive
today
there
are
signs
that
these
roles
are
being
reversed
a
growing
number
of
homes
marriage
counselors
report
the
wife
is
taking
a
commanding
role
in
sexual
relationships
is
she
who
decides
the
time
the
place
the
surroundings
and
the
frequency
of
the

she
who
says
aye

nay

the
intimate
questions
of

technique
and
mechanics
not
the

a
certain
point
of
course
no
woman
can
be
dominant
nature
has
seen
to
that
there
is
little
doubt
that
in
many
marriages
the
wife
is
boss
of
the
marital
bed
course
there
remain
many
marriages
in
which
the
husband
maintains
his
supremacy
even
in
these
marriages
psychologists
say
wives
are
asserting
themselves
more
strongly
meekest
most
submissive
wife
of
today
is
a
tiger
by
her
or
standards
many
experts
this
trend
was
inevitable
consider
it
simply
a
sign
of
our
times
society
has
emancipated
the
woman
giving
her
new
independence
and
new
authority
is
only
natural
that
she
assert
herself
in
the
sexual

likely
to
produce
sexual

in
which
wives
are
more
too
many
psychologists
and
marriage
counselors
agree
that
domination
of
the
sex
relationship
by
one
partner
or
the
other
can
be
unhealthy
and
even
dangerous
can
in
fact
wreck
a
marriage
a
husband
is
sexually
selfish
and
heedless
of
his
desires
she
is
cheated
of
the
fulfillment
and
pleasure
nature
intended
for
her
she
begins
to
regard
him
as

bestial
and
unworthy

supremacy
demeans
the
husband
saps
his
and
robs
him
of
his
masculinity
is
a
target
of
ridicule
to
his
wife
and
often
since
private
affairs
rarely
remain
private
to
the
outside
world
as
well
marriage
can
survive
almost
any
kind
of
stress
except
an
open
and
direct
challenge

one
of
the

that
the

becomes

and
the

follower
says
the
effects
on
their
whole
relationship
sexual
and
otherwise
can
be
disastrous
one
extreme
case
cited
by
a
psychologist
an
office
wife
refused
to
have
sexual
relations
with
her
husband
unless
he
bought
her
the
luxuries
she
demanded
win
her
favors
her
husband
first
took
an
additional
job
then
desperately
began
to
embezzle
from
his
employer
at
last
he
was
sentenced
to
prison
he
was
in
custody
his
wife
divorced
him
typical
is
the
case
of
a
suburban
housewife
described
by
a
marriage
counselor
woman
repeatedly
complained
she
was
too
tired
for
marital
relations
please
her
her
husband
assumed
some
of
the
domestic
chores
he
was
cooking
washing
dishes
bathing
the
children
and
even
ironing
and
still
his
wife
refused
to
have
relations
as
often
as
he
desired
them
wife
described
by
a
psychologist
so
dominated
her
husband
that
she
actually
placed
their
sexual
relationship
on
a
schedule
writing
it
down
right
between
the
weekly
meetings
and
the
neighborhood
card
parties
put
sex
on
a
basis
every
money
argument
she
rebuffed
her
overtures
until
the
matter
was
settled
in
her
favor
say
the
partners
in
marriages
like
these
can
almost
be
typed
wife
is
likely
to
be
young
sophisticated
smart
as
a
whip
often
a
girl
who
has
sacrificed
a
promising
career
for
marriage
knows
the
power
of
the
sex
urge
and
how
to
use
it
to
manipulate
her
husband
husband
is
usually
a
professional
preoccupied
with
his
job
often
an
organization
man
whose
motto
for
getting
ahead
is
rock
the
boat
this
leads
to
his
becoming
demandingly
dominant
in
marriage
in
on
the
job
and
unable
to
assert
himself
he
uses
the
sex
act
so
he
can
be
supreme
in
at
least
one
area
often
though
he
is
so
accustomed
to
submitting
to
authority
on
the
job
without
argument
that
he
lives
by
the
same
rule
at
home
psychologists
in
fact
suggest
that
husbands
often
are
more
to
blame
for
marriages
than
their
wives
attempt
at
control
these
psychologists
contend
is
sometimes
merely
a
pathetic
effort
to
compel
her
husband
to
pay
as
much
attention
to
her
as
he
does
to
his
job
no
woman
can
ever
completely
monopolize
the
sexual
initiative
her
husband
also
desires
sex
the
act
cannot
be
consummated
however
in
such
marriages
as
those
cited
the
husband
is
at
his
mercy
pattern
says
psychologist
at
for
is
for
the
husband
to
hover
about
anxiously
and
eagerly
virtually
trembling
in
his
hope
that
she
will
flash
him
the
signal
that
tonight
is
the
night
one
seriously
contends
of
course
that
the
domineering
wife
is
sexually
speaking
a
new
character
in
our
world
all
the
henpecked
husband
with
his
shrewish
wife
is
a
comic
figure
of
long
standing
in
literature
and
on
the
stage
as
points
out
is
no
evidence
that
these
became
suddenly
emboldened
when
they
crossed
the
threshhold
of
the
master
bedroom
says
a
certain
number
of
docile
retiring
men
always
have
been
around
frigid
and
they
homosexual
just
restrained
in
all
of
life
like
to

such
man
once
confided
to
psychiatrist
that
he
preferred
to
have
his

the
sexual
aggressor

he
replied
primly
no

such
cases
were
in
the

and
abroad
has
been
built
around
the
dominating
male

the
appears
to
endorse
the
concept
survival
on
our
own
frontier
for
example
could
quite
literally
depend
on
a
strength
and
ability
to
bring
home
the
bacon
and
the
dependent
wife
seldom
questioned
his
judgment
about
anything
including
the
marriage
bed
carried
over
into
the
more
urbanized
late
and
early
centuries
when
the
man
ruled
the
roost
in
the
best
manner
those
days
a
wife
had
mighty
few
rights
in
the
domestic
sphere
and
even
fewer
in
the
sexual
sphere
expected
to
like
it
the
late
gynecologist
once
summed
up
the
attitude
of
the
of
the
period
shamefacedly
thought
of
themselves
as
used
by
their
husbands
and
history
indicates
they
often
quite
literally
were
was
the
turning
point
did
women
begin
to
assert
themselves
sexually
date
it
from
woman
suffrage
others
from
when
women
first
began
to
challenge
men
in
the
marketplace
still
others
from
the
era
of
the
emancipated
flapper
and
bathtub
gin
everyone
agrees
however
that
the
trend
toward
female
sexual
aggressiveness
was
tremendously
accelerated
with
the
postwar
rush
to
the
suburbs
alone
while
her
husband
was
miles
away
in
the
city
the
modern
wife
assumed
more
and
more
duties
normally
reserved
for
the
male
gave
her
almost
undisputed
sway
over
and
home
maintenance
found
she
could
cope
with
all
kinds
of
problems
for
which
she
was
once
considered
too
helpless
liked
this
taste
of
authority
and
independence
and
with
darkness
was
not
likely
to
give
it
up
few
wives
says
who
balance
the
checkbook
fix
the
car
choose
where
the
family
will
live
and
deal
with
the
tradesmen
are
suddenly
going
to
become
submissive
where
sex
is
concerned
woman
who
dominates
other
family
affairs
will
dominate
the
sexual
relationship
as
well
an
additional
factor
was
helping
to
make
women
more
sexually
the
comparatively
recent
discovery
of
the
true
depths
of
female
desire
and
response
manuals
and
magazine
articles
began
to
stress
the
importance
of
the
female
climax
began
to
describe
in
detail
the
capacity
for
response
fact
the
noted
psychologist
and
sex
researcher
has
declared
flatly
that
women
are
sexually
superior
to
men
to
the
average
woman
is
capable
of
far
greater
sexual
arousal
than
her
partner
surprisingly
says
some
recently
enlightened
wives
are
out
to
claim
these
capabilities
paradoxically
according
to
many
wives
despise
their
husbands
for
not
standing
up
to
them
aggressive
woman
wants
a
man
to
demand
not
knuckle
under
the
husband
becomes
passive
in
the
face
of
his
aggressiveness
says
the
wife
in
turn
finds
him
inadequate
she
fails
to
gain
sexual
satisfaction
such
wife
says
became
disgusted
with
her
weak
husband
and
flurried
through
a
series
of
extramarital
affairs
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
stronger
man
her
personality
was
such
that
each
affair
lasted
only
until
that
lover
too
had
been
conquered
and
reduced
to
passivity
the
wife
to
the
next
on
the
list
some
cases
however
domination
of
the
sex
act
by
one
partner
can
be
temporary
triggered
by
a
passing
but
urgent
emotional
need
a
man
who
is
butting
a
stone
wall
at
the
office
may
become
unusually
aggressive
in
bed
the
one
place
he
can
still
be
champion
his
problems
work
out
he
may
return
to
his
old
pattern
a
burst
of
aggressiveness
will
sweep
over
a
man
or
his
wife
because
he
or
she
feels
age
creeping
up
the
other
hand
a
husband
who
always
has
been
vigorous
and
assertive
may
suddenly
become
passive
asking
psychologists
say
for
reassurance
that
his
wife
still
finds
him
desirable
a
wife
may
make
sudden
demands
that
she
be
courted
flattered
or
coaxed
simply
because
she
needs
her
ego
lifted
any
case
remarks
such
problems
are
a
own
affair
and
always
be
measured
by
a
general
yardstick
long
as
the
couple
is
in
agreement
in
their
approach
to
sex
it
makes
little
difference
if
one
or
the
other
dominates
declares
important
point
is
that
both
be
satisfied
with
the
adjustment
experts
say
however
that
if
sexual
domination
by
one
or
the
other
partner
exists
for
longer
than
a
brief
period
it
is
likely
to
shake
the
marriage
just
as
domination
today
often
begins
with
the
wife
so
the
cure
generally
must
lie
with
the
husband
get
a
marriage
back
where
it
belongs
comments
of
the
the
husband
must
take
some
very
basic
steps
must
begin
paradoxically
by
becoming
more
selfish
must
become
more
expressive
of
his
own
desires
more
demanding
and
less
understanding
many
husbands
continues
worry
about
how
well
doing
and
fear
that
their
success
depends
on
some
trick
or
technique
of
sexual
play

the
final

discovered
that

at

a

do

not

they

occlusion
is
the

out
making
a
double
row
to
the
thinking
of
to
years
ago
when
all
malocclusion
was
blamed
on
some
unfortunate
habit
recent
studies
show
that
most
tooth
irregularity
has
at
least
its
beginning
in
hereditary
predisposition
this
does
not
mean
that
a
teeth
or
jaws
must
necessarily
resemble
those
of
someone
in
his
family
deformity
may
be
the
result
of
excessive
or
or
but
important
to
remember
that
a
difference
between
normal
and
excessive
sucking
habits
perfectly
normal
for
babies
to
suck
their
thumbs
and
no
mother
need
worry
if
a
child
continues
this
habit
until
he
is
two
or
three
years
old
sucking
up
to
the
fifth
year
may
not
affect
a
teeth
but
after
that
if
pressure
is
frequent
it
will
have
an
effect
can
also
result
if
baby
teeth
are
lost
too
soon
or
retained
too
long
a
child
loses
a
molar
at
the
age
of
two
the
adjoining
teeth
may
shift
toward
the
empty
space
thus
narrowing
the
place
intended
for
the
permanent
ones
and
producing
a
jumble
baby
teeth
are
retained
too

the
incoming
second

be
prevented
from

can
save
teeth
every
orthodontist
sees
children
who
are
embarrassed
by
their
malformed
teeth
such
youngsters
rarely
smile
or
they
try
to
speak
with

closed
certain
cases
as
in
a
personality
is
affected
from
the
point
of
view
teeth
should
be
corrected
for
physical
reasons
alignment
may
result
in
early
loss
of
teeth
through
a
breakdown
of
the
bony
structure
that
supports
their
roots
serious
condition
popularly
known
as
pyorrhea
is
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
tooth
loss
in
adults
too
misplaced
or
teeth
are
prone
to
trapping
food
particles
increasing
the
likelihood
of
rapid
decay
these
and
other
reasons
says
orthodontics
can
prolong
the
life
of
teeth
failure
of
teeth
to
fit
together
when
closed
interferes
with
normal
chewing
so
that
a
child
may
swallow
food
whole
and
put
a
burden
on
his
digestive
system
of
these
chewing
troubles
a
child
may
avoid
certain
foods
he
needs
for
adequate
nutrition

orthodontic
work
is
done
on
children
between
the
ages
of

though
there
have
been
patients
as
young
as
two
and
as
old
as
says
the
period
from
to
the
permanent
set
of
teeth
is
usually
completed
yet
the
continuing
growth
of
bony
tissue
makes
moving
badly
placed
teeth
comparatively
easy
work
is
possible
because
teeth
are
held
firmly
but
not
rigidly
by
a
system
of
peridontal
membrane
with
an
involved
nerve
network
to
the
bone
in
the
jaw
they
are
not
anchored
directly
to
the
bone
pressure
applied
over
a
period
of
time
produces
a
change
in
the
bony
deposit
so
a
tooth
functions
normally
in
the
new
position
into
which
it
has
been
guided
can
expect
when
she
enters
the
office
her
first
visit
the
orthodontist
will
take
photographs
tooth
measurements
and
tooth
prints
an
impression
of
the
mouth
that
permits
him
to
study
her
teeth
and
jaws
he
decides
to
proceed
he
will
for
an
appliance
consisting
of
bands
plastic
plates
fine
wires
and
tiny
springs
appliance
will

a
gentle
and
continuous

intermittent
pressure
on

the

bone
cells
on

of
it
will
dissolve
and

the

at
the
rate
at

too
rapidly
serious

can
be
done
to
their

as
well
as
to
the
surrounding
bone

explains
one
or
two
teeth
can
affect
the
whole
system
and
an
plan
of

can
disrupt
the

pattern
of
a

the
first
few
days
of
wearing
the
appliance
and
immediately
following
each
adjustment
may
have
a
slight
discomfort
or
soreness
but
after
a
short
time
this
will
disappear
are
often
concerned
that
orthodontic
appliances
may
cause
teeth
to
decay
in

a
band
actually
protects
the
part
of
the
tooth
that
is
covered
will
enter
the
treatment
stage
and
visit
the
orthodontist
once
or
twice
a
month
depending
on
the
severity
of
her
condition
these
visits
the
dentist
will
adjust
the

to
increase
the
pressure
on
her
teeth
comes
the
retention
stage
teeth
have
now
been
guided
into
a
desirable
new
position
because
teeth
sometimes
may
drift
back
to
their
original
position
a
retaining
appliance
is
used
to
lock
them
in
place
this
is
a
thin
band
of
wire
attached
to
the
molars
and
stretching
across
the
teeth
may
wear
this
only
at
night
or
for
a
few
hours
during
the
day
comes
the
time
when
the
last
wire
is
removed
and
walks
out
a
healthier
and
more
attractive
girl
than
when
she
first
went
to
the
orthodontist
long
will
this
take
one
tooth
that
has
come
in
wrong
may
take
only
a
few
months
all
the

take
a

more

reason
today
are
aware
of
the
value
of
orthodontics
and
as
a
result
there
are
more
practitioners
in
the
field
orthodontists
require
an
initial
payment
to
cover
the
cost
of
diagnostic

usually
the
remainder
of
the

anyone
who
said

we

that

he

through

a

a
small

from

the

an

is
why
asks
parents
not
to
insist
against
their
advice
that
their

have
orthodontic

because
of
our
stress
on

our

some
parents
demand
that

before
it

to
do
so
the

a

they

mourning

mediums
with
whom
the
is
working
in

are
in
a
waking

only
slightly
dissociated
state
so
that
the

can
make

ask

answer
questions
instead
of
talking
with
a

who
speaks
through
an
entranced
sensitive
we
have
here
is
in
some
ways
more
like
an
ordinary
conversation
it
is
not
really
only
a
conversation
a
sitter
in
a
personal
sitting
has
been
amazed
to
realize
that
the
medium
was
describing
very
vividly
his
state
of
mind
himself
might
not
have
been
really
aware
of
his
own
mood
it
had
been
latent
unspecified
and
only
partly
realized
until
she
described
it
to
him
striking
indeed
is
this
ability
to
put
a
finger
on
moods
and
to
clarify
them
in
the
next
visit
that
the
researcher
made
to
the
medium
he
did
not
receive
a
personal
reading
he
brought
with
him
the
names
of
some
people
he
had
never
met
and
of
whom
the
medium
knew
nothing
this
was
to
be
a
proxy
sitting
was
noted
earlier
it
is
important
that
in
valid
objective
study
of
this
sort
of
communication
the
interested
sitter
should
be
separated
from
the
sensitive
of
at
the
described
the
basis
for
the
experiment
in
a
tomorrow
article
remarked
has
been
clearly
established
that
in
a
number
of
instances
the
message
did
not
come
from
a
spirit
but
was
received
telepathically
by
the
medium
from
the
sitter
possibility
has
to
be
ruled
out
that
the
may
tap
the
memory
of
the
sitter
and
to
do
this
the
two
central
characters
in
this
drama
must
be
separated
way
to
do
this
is
by
proxy
sittings
wherein
the
person
seeking
a
message
does
not
himself
meet
with
the
medium
but
is
represented
by
a
substitute
the
proxy
sitter
the
latter
knows
nothing
about
the
absent
sitter
except
his
name
given
by
the
experimenter
he
cannot
possibly
give
any
clues
conscious
or
unconscious
far
less
ask
leading
questions
he
can
do
is
to
be
an
objective
and
careful
questioner
seeking
to
help
the
sensitive
in
clarifying
and
making
more
specific
her
paranormal
impressions
in
these
experiments
appointment
sittings
are
used
the
absent
sitter
makes
a
date
with
a
communicator
someone
close
to
him
who
is
deceased
asking
him
to
come
in
at
a
certain
hour
when
a
channel
will
be
open
for
him
this
case
the
proxy
sitter
will
know
only
the
name
of
the
communicator
nothing
else
gives
this
to
the
medium
at
the
appointed
time
and
the
reading
then
will
be
concerned
with
material
about
or
messages
from
the
communicator
always
a
tape
recording
or
detailed
notes
are
made
and
a
typescript
of
this
is
sent
to
the
absent

this
proxy
situation
has
set
up
at

a
partial
barrier
between
the
and
the
absent
mind
is
now
harder
to
assume
telepathy
as
a
basis
for
the
statements
though
research
still
does
not
know
how
far
afield
can
range
the
original
absent

must
decide
whether
the

are
meaningful
to
him
again
laboratory
approaches
are
being
evolved
for
it
is
recognized
how
elastic
these

can
be
how
they
can
apply
to
many
people
and
are
often
stated
in

all
too
easily
applied
to
any
own

you
look
at
a

for
someone
else
you
will
probably
see
that
many
of
the
items
could
be
considered
as
applicable
to
you
even
when
you
were
not
in
the
picture
at
all
interested
sitter
may
think
the
sensitive
has
made
a
hit
describing
something
accurately
for
him
but
can
he
really
be
sure
that
another
sitter
hearing
the
same
statement
would
not
apply
it
subjectively
to
his
own
circumstances
is
of
course
easy
to
see
how
will
mean
to
one
person
and
little
to
another
journey
a
little
white
house
a
change
of
outlook
can
apply
to
many
people
even
more
complex
items
can
be
interpreted
to
conform
to
own
point
of
view
which
is
by
nature
so
personal
sitter
may
think
a
leather
couch
identifies
a
reading
as
surely
directed
to
him
to
another
it
seems
that
nobody
but
his
father
ever
used
the
phrase
boy
get
around
this
quite
difficult
corner
there
is
one
first
aid
to
objectiveness
prevent
the
distant
sitter
from
knowing
which
reading
was
for
him
he
is
not
told
which
of
four
or
five
readings
was
meant
for
him
he
can
more
readily
assess
each
item
in
a
larger
frame
that
statement
really
sound
as
if
it
were
for
me
significant
in
my
particular
life
am
taking
something
that
could
really
apply
to
almost
anybody
and
forgetting
that
many
other
people
probably
have
had
a
similar
experience
experimenters
would
consider
as
impressive
such
statements
as
the
following
which
if
they
turned
out
to
be
hits
are
so
unusual
as
to
be
really
significant

each

can
be
given
a
weight
and
each

a
score
by
adding
up
these
weights
dates
would
be
important
as
would
double
names
categories
have
been
explored
to
find
out
about
these
empirical
probabilities
against
which
to
measure
the
readings
the
parapsychology
experiment
readings
are
made
by
a
variety
of
sensitives
for
a
large
number
of
cooperating
sitters
trying
to
throw
light
on
this
question
of
the
significance
of
mediumistic
statements
is
very
important
indeed
in
the
field
of
perception
and
its
relation
to
the
survival
hypothesis
to
know
whether
the
statements
are
actually
only
those
which
any
intuitive
person
might
venture
and
an
eager
sitter
attach
to
himself
on
the
other
hand
are
unlikely
facts
being
stated
facts
which
are
in
themselves
significant
and
not
easily
applicable
to
everybody
is
one
thing
the
experiments
are
designed
to
find
out
after
the
sitting
has
been
held
several
readings
at
one
time
are
mailed
and
the
distant
sitter
whose
name
or
whose
name
was
given
to
the
medium
must
mark
each
little
item
as
or
applying
to
him
and
he
feels
not
to
anyone
else
is
required
to
mark
every
item
and
to
indicate
which
reading
he
feels
is
actually
his
these
evaluations
are
then
totted
up
and
tabulated
by
adding
up
the
and
with
the
weight
placed
on
those
in
the
own
reading
is
if
he
marks
as
most
correct
a
reading
not
meant
for
him
the
total
experimental
score
falls
if
he
gives
a
heavy
rating
to
his
own
reading
and
finds
more
accurate
facts
in
it
than
in
the
others
a
point
is
chalked
up
for
the
intrinsic
objective
meaningfulness
of
this
type
of
mediumistic
material
there
are
some
positive
results
though
the
final
findings
will
not
be
known
for
a
long
time
and
then
further
research
can
be
formulated
another
approach
to
the
same
procedure
the
content
of
the
readings
is
analyzed
so
as
to
see
how
the
particular
medium
is
likely
to
slant
her
statements
she
often
speak
of
locations
of
cause
of
death
she
accurately
give
dates
ages
kind
of
occupation
is
possible
to
find
out
in
which
categories
most
of
her
correct
statements
fall
and
where
she
makes
most
of
her
hits
when
so
to
speak
the
cream
has
been
skimmed
off
and
the
items
in
the
successful
categories
separated
out
the
sitter
can
be
asked
to
consider
and
rate
only
this
concentrated
cream
where
the
sensitive
is
at
her
best
impressions
are
evidently
of
all
sorts
and
seem
to
involve
all
the
senses
feel
cold
the
medium
says
or
leg
aches
head
is
heavy
perhaps
she
hears
words
or
sounds
such
a
noise
of
loud
machinery
or
hear
a
child
crying
or
says
all
here
and
glad
to
see
you
an
entire
scene
comes
into
consciousness
with
action
and
motion
or
a
static
view
a
house
under
a
pine
tree
with
a
little
stone
path
going
up
to
the
door
sensitive
often
seems
to
smell
definite
odors
too
or
subjectively
feels
emotions
she
displays
amazing
eidetic
imagery
and
seems
to
see
all
details
in
perspective
as
if
the
scene
were
actually
there
pressed
by
the
sitter
for
more
detail
she
may
be
able
to
bring
the
picture
more
into
focus
and
see
more
sharply
almost
as
if
she
were
physically
going
closer
asked
how
she
gets
her
impressions
she
probably
can
only
say
that
she
just
gets
them
some
more
vividly
than
others
this
is
not
so
extraordinary
after
all
in
normal
experience
one
gets
impressions
without
knowing
exactly
how
of
atmosphere
of
one
personalities

there
is
an
element

in
a
symbolic
form
and
cannot
be
taken
at
face
value
is
apparently
by
symbols
that
the
unconscious
speaks
to
the
conscious
and
the
medium
has
to
translate
these
into
meaning
communication
with
an

on
the

this

may
assume
the

this

not
necessarily
refer
to
an
actual

taken

it
could
have
referred
to
a
state
of
mental
or
spiritual
confinement
this
connection
it
is
worth
noting
how
names
are
sometimes
obtained
they
are
often
heard
clairaudiently
as
if
a
voice
were
speaking
them
in
other
cases
they
are
apprehended
visually
as
symbols

were
properly
termed
political

itself

the
conclusion
of
the
first
phase
of
a
process
of
tragic
recollection
and
of
refining
the
recollection
that
will
last
as
long
as
there
are
such
it
was
beyond
politics
and
had
no
need
of
justification
by
a
message
is
not
an
individual
that
is
in
the
dock
at
this
historical
trial
said
and
not
the
regime
alone
but
throughout
history
could
supplying
with
a
platform
on
which
to
maintain
that
one
could
collaborate
in
the
murder
of
millions
of
without
being
an
contribute
to
a
verdict
against
if
it
was
not
an
individual
who
was
in
the
dock
why
was
the
as
we
shall
observe
later
all
but
scuttled
in
the
attempt
to
prove
a
fiend
questions
touch
the
root
of
confusion
in
the
case
might
be
contended
of
course
that
in
stubbornly
denying
feelings
was
lying
or
insisting
on
a
private
definition
of
in
either
event
he
was
the
wrong
man
for
the
kind
of
case
outlined
by
and
set
forth
in
the
indictment
such
a
case
the
defendant
should
serve
as
a
clear
example
and
not
have
to
be
tied
to
the
issue
by
argument
who
could
be
linked
to
only
by
overcoming
his
objections
is
scarcely
a
good
specimen
of
the
throughout
the
ages
at
though
he
might
the
could
not
establish
that
the
defendant
was
falsifying
the
way
he
felt
about
or
that
what
he
did
feel
fell
into
the
generally
recognized
category
of
he
believed
that
the
were
enemies
of
the
and
such
a
belief
is
of
course
typical
of
patriotic
but
he
believed
in
the
in
a
kind
of
abstract
theological
way
like
a
member
of
a
cult
speculating
on
the
nature
of
things
real
question
was
how
one
passed
from
of
this
sort
to
murder
and
the
answer
to
this
question
is
not
to
be
found
in
itself
regard
to
it
was
to
be
found
in
the
outlook
which
contained
a
principle
separate
from
and
far
worse
than
a
principle
by
which
the
poison
of
itself
was
made
more
virulent
under
the
guidance
of
this
principle
one
could
as
declared
feel
personally
friendly
toward
the
and
still
be
their
murderer
through
fear
of
disobeying
orders
as
kept
trying
to
explain
but
through
a
peculiar
giddiness
that
began
in
a
of
the
vicious
absurdities
contained
in
the
interpretation
of
history
and
grew
with
each
of
victories
into
a
permanent
and
sense
of
magical
rightness
that
was
able
to
respond
to
any
proposal
and
the
more
outrageous
the
better
try
it
any
rate
the
substance
of
testimony
was
that
all
his
actions
flowed
from
his
membership
in
the
party
and
the
and
though
the
did
his
utmost
to
prove
actual
personal
hatred
of
his
success
on
this
score
was
doubtful
and
the
lesson
weakened
to
that
extent
if
the
did
not
expose
the
special
mania
so
deadly
to
as
well
as
to
anyone
upon
whom
it
happened
to
light

did
it

very
effectively
against
the

an
extension
of
the
measures
already
operating
in

phase
of

that
the

on
the

that
had

to

this
opportunity

between
the

in
the
of
the
sober
man

the
potential
warning
of
the
doubt
many
of
the
citizens
of

conceived

innocent
dislike

for

in

one
of
the
best
ways
of
warning
the
world
against

to
demonstrate
its
workings
as
a
dangerous
weapon
himself

a
model
of
how
the

confrontation
of
the
outrage

a
recovery
of

camps
a
recovery
that
took
fifteen
years

let
no
one
believe
that
it
could
be
hastened
by
silence
across
a
distance
of
time
could
the
epic
accounting
begin
is
already
difficult
to
recall
how
little
we
knew
before
the
of
what
had
been
done
to
the
of
is
not
that
the
facts
of
the
persecution
were
unavailable
most
of
the
information
elicited
in
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
numerous
tribunals
and
investigating
commissions
and
by
reports

and
accounts
in
a
hospital
presented
seven
physicians
with
an
ultimatum
to
quit
the
or
to
resign
from
the

staff
agreed
but
four
declined
and
were
suspended
a
flood
of
protests
they
were
reinstated
at
the
beginning
of
peace
of
the
community
was
badly
disturbed
and
people
across
the
nation
reading
of
the
incident
felt
uneasy
in
the
of
refused
to
permit
a

to
provide
a

device
thereby
precipitated

bitter
controversy

months
until
the

later

of

embroiled
in
an
angry
dispute
over
the
alleged
invasion
of
a
right
to
freedom
of
religious
belief
and
conscience
incidents
typical
of
many
others
dramatize
the
distressing
fact
that
no
controversy
during
the
last
several
decades
has
caused
more
tension
rancor
and
strife
among
religious
groups
in
this
country
than
the
issue
has
flared
up
periodically
on
the
front
pages
of
newspapers
in
communities
divided
over
regulations
in
municipal
hospitals
and
health
and
agencies
has
erupted
on
the
national
level
in
the
matter
of
including
information
and
material
in
foreign
aid
to
underdeveloped
countries
it
is
not
actually
erupting
it
rumbles
and
smolders
in
sullen
resentment
like
a
volcano
ready
to
explode
at
any
moment
time
has
come
for
citizens
of
all
faiths
to
unite
in
an
effort
to
remove
this
divisive
and
nettlesome
issue
from
the
political
and
social
life
of
our
nation
first
step
toward
the
goal
is
the
establishment
of
a
new
atmosphere
of
mutual
good
will
and
friendly
communication
on
other
than
the
polemical
level
of
emotional
recrimination
loaded
phrases
and
sloganeering
we
need
a
dispassionate
study
of
the
facts
a
better
understanding
of
the
opposite
viewpoint
and
a
more
serious
effort
to
extend
the
areas
of
agreement
until
a
solution
is
reached
too
frequently
points
out
managing
editor
of
run
roughshod
over
sensibilities
in
this
matter
by
failure
to
consider
the
reasoning
behind
the
position
and
particularly
by
their
jibes
at
the
fact
that
opinion
on
birth
control
has
changed
in
recent
decades
too
often
our
language
is
unduly
harsh
second
step
is
to
recognize
the
substantial
agreement
frequently
blurred
by
emotionalism
and
inaccurate
newspaper
reporting
already
existing
between
and
concerning
the
objectives
of
family
planning
of
being
obliged
or
even
encouraged
to
beget
the
greatest
possible
number
of
offspring
as
many
imagine
the
ideal
of
responsible
parenthood
is
stressed
planning
is
encouraged
so
that
parents
will
be
able
to
provide
properly
for
their
offspring
declared
in
that
it
is
possible
to
be
exempt
from
the
normal
obligation
of
parenthood
for
a
long
time
and
even
for
the
whole
duration
of
married
life
if
there
are
serious
reasons
such
as
those
often
mentioned
in
the
medical
eugenic
economic
and
social
indications
means
that
such
factors
as
the
health
of
the
parents
particularly
the
mother
their
ability
to
provide
their
children
with
the
necessities
of
life
the
degree
of
population
density
of
a
country
and
the
shortage
of
housing
facilities
may
legitimately
be
taken
into
consideration
in
determining
the
number
of
offspring
are
substantially
the
same
factors
considered
by
in
family
planning
laws
of
many
states
permit
birth
control
only
for
medical
reasons
however
sanctions
a
much
more
liberal
policy
on
family
planning
and
are
in
agreement
over
the
objectives
of
family
planning
but
disagree
over
the
methods
to
be
used
sanctions
only
abstention
or
the
rhythm
method
also
known
as
the
use
of
the
infertile
or
safe
period
considers
this
to
be
the
method
provided
by
nature
and
its
divine
involves
no
frustration
of
laws
but
simply
an
intelligent
and
disciplined
use
of
them
the
exception
of
the
and
the
most
churches
make
no
moral
distinction
between
rhythm
and
mechanical
or
chemical
contraceptives
allowing
the
couple
free
choice
is
a
difference
in
theological
belief
where
there
seems
little
chance
of
agreement
grounds
for
the
position
are
the
teachings
of
the
fathers
and
doctors
of
the
early
the
unbroken
tradition
of
nineteen
centuries
the
decisions
of
the
highest
ecclesiastical
authority
and
the
natural
law
latter
plays
a
prominent
role
in
theology
and
is
considered
decisive
entirely
apart
from
in
determining
the
ethical
character
of

tradition
regards
as
that
the
primary
objective
purpose
of
the
conjugal
act
is
procreation
and
that
the
fostering
of
the
mutual
love
of
the
spouses
is
the
secondary
and
subjective
end
conclusion
is
based
on
two
propositions
that
man
by
the
use
of
his
reason
can
ascertain
purpose
in
the
universe
and
that
makes
known
purpose
by
certain
given
physical
arrangements
man
can
readily
deduce
that
the
primary
objective
end
of
the
conjugal
act
is
procreation
the
propagation
of
the
race
man
may
not
supplant
or
frustrate
the
physical
arrangements
established
by
who
through
the
law
of
rhythm
has
provided
a
natural
method
for
the
control
of
conception
that
is
the
of
this
law
and
of
all
laws
of
nature
believe
that
they
are
obliged
to
obey
those
laws
not
frustrate
or
mock
them
it
be
granted
then
that
the
theological
differences
in
this
area
between
and
appear
to
be
irreconcilable
people
differ
in
their
religious
beliefs
on
scores
of
doctrines
without
taking
up
arms
against
those
who
disagree
with
them
is
it
so
different
in
regard
to
birth
control
is
because
each
side
has
sought
to
implement
its
distinctive
theological
belief
through
legislation
and
thus
indirectly
force
its
belief
or
at
least
the
practical
consequences
thereof
upon
others
is
always
a
temptation
for
a
religious
organization
especially
a
powerful
or
dominant
one
to
impose
through
the
clenched
fist
of
the
law
its
creedal
viewpoint
upon
others
and
have
succumbed
to
this
temptation
in
the
past
what
happened
during
when
the
churches
united
to
push
the
law
through
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
use
of
liquor
in
any
form
or
in
any
degree
is
intrinsically
evil
and
sinful
over
four
million
men
away
at
war
forced
their
distinctive
theological
belief
upon
the
general
public
the
return
of
our
soldiers
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
belief
was
not
shared
by
the
great
majority
of
citizens
attempt
to
enforce
that
belief
ushered
in
a
reign
of
bootleggers
racketeers
hijackers
and
gangsters
that
led
to
a
breakdown
of
law
unparalleled
in
our
history
noble
experiment
came
to
an
inglorious
end
tumultuous
painful
and
costly
experience
shows
clearly
that
a
law
expressing
a
moral
judgment
cannot
be
enforced
when
it
has
little
correspondence
with
the
general
view
of
society
experience
holds
a
lesson
for
us
all
in
regard
to
birth
control
today
to
the
turn
of
the
century
contraception
was
condemned
by
all
churches
as
immoral
unnatural
and
contrary
to
divine
law
was
generally
reflected
in
the
civil
laws
of
countries
the
and
stand
virtually
alone
in
holding
that
conviction
various
expressing
the
viewpoint
mirror
the
gradual
change
that
has
taken
place
among
generally
the
repeated
its
condemnation
of
contraception
and
issued
an
emphatic
warning
against
the
use
of
unnatural
means
for
the
avoidance
of
conception
together
with
the
grave
dangers
physical
moral
and
religious
thereby
incurred
and
against
the
evils
which
the
extension
of
such
use
threaten
the
race
the
view
that
the
sexual
union
is
an
end
in
itself
the
declared

what
must
always
be
regarded
as
the
governing
considerations
of
marriage
is
the
primary
purpose
for
which
marriage
exists
namely
the
continuance
of
the
race
through
the
gift
and
heritage
of
children
the
other
is
the
paramount
importance
in

deliberate
and

affirmed
the
primary
purpose
of

to
be
the
procreation
of

but
conceded
that
in
certain
limited
circumstances
contraception
might
be
morally
legitimate
the
endorsed
birth
control
as
the
responsibility
laid
by
on
parents
everywhere
other
denominations
preceded
the
in
such
action
out
of
members
of
a
committee
of
the
of
ratified
artificial
methods
of
birth
control
to
the
necessity
the
committee
declared
for
some
form
of
effective
control
of
the
size
of
the
family
and
the
spacing
of
children
and
consequently
of
control
of
conception
there
can
be
no
question
is
general
agreement
also
that
sex
union
between
husbands
and
wives
as
an
expression
of
mutual
affection
without
relation
to
procreation
is
right
then
many
denominations
have
made
separate
pronouncements
in
which
they
not
only
approved
birth
control
but
declared
it
at
times
to
be
a
religious
duty
determines
the
morality
they
state
is
not
the
means
used
but
the
motive
general
the
means
excluding
abortion
that
prove
most
effective
are
considered
the
most
ethical
development
is
reflected
in
the
action
taken
in
by
the

board
of

general
board
declared
of
the
churches

contraception
and
periodic
continence
to
be
morally
right
when
the

right
general
conviction
is
that
motives
rather
than
methods
form
the
primary
moral
issue
provided
the

are
limited
to
the
prevention
of

once

condemned

forbidden
by

now
not

approved
by
the
overwhelming
majority
of
denominations
but
also
deemed
at
certain
times
to
be
a
positive
religious
duty
viewpoint
has
now
been
translated
into
action
by
the
majority
of
people
in

have
disclosed
that
most
married
couples
are
now
using
contraceptives

the
practice

the
significance
of
this
radical
and
revolutionary
change
in
the
thought
and
habits
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
is
clear
profound
and
try
to
oppose
the
general
religious
and
moral
conviction
of
such
a
majority
by
a
legislative
fiat
would
be
to
invite
the

breakdown
of

and
order
that
was
occasioned
by
the
experiment
brings
us
to
the
fact
that
the
realities
we
are
dealing
with
lie
not
in
the
field
of
civil
legislation
but
in
the
realm
of
conscience
and
religion
are
moral
judgments
and
matters
of
theological
belief
and
religion

concerned
with
private
sin

is
made
to
impose
upon
the

authority
the
impossible
task
of

the

of

as
important
as
what
a

occurred
a
country
superimposes
its
cultural
and
political
attitudes
on
others
it
searches
its
heritage
in
hopes
of
justifying
its

folklore
and
legend
usually
disguised

history

allowed
to
account
for
group
actions
to
provide
a
focal
point
for
group
loyalty

to
become
a

identification
can
apply
these
facts
to
in
the
late
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
as
she
spread
her
dominion
over
palm

they
can
be
applied
again
to
the
in

recent

popularity
of
local
color

the
the
steady
currency
of
the

the
increased
emphasis

the
frontier

mass

cases
in
point
is
it
an
accident
that
baseball
growing
into
the
national
game
in
the
last
years
has
become
a
microcosm
of
life
that
learned
societies
such
as
the
and
the
were
founded
in
the
or
that
courses
in
literature
civilization

have
swept
our
school
and
college
curricula

nationalism
has
really
outlived
its
usefulness
in
a
country
as
as
ours

its
continued
existence

of

major
culture

of
the
nationalism

lost
few
of
its
charms
for
the

writer
or
man
in

an
understandable
paradox
that
most

essentially
egocentric

isolationistic
point

some
vain
hope
of
personal
contact

unconcerned
that
his
or
her
plight
is
the
result
of
a
complex
of
personal
economic
and
governmental
actions

beyond
the
normal
comprehension

rewriting

into
legend
and
developing
appropriate
national
heroes
such
has
served
a
particularly
useful
purpose
heterogeneous
people
have
needed
it
to
attain
an
element
of
cultural
and
political
cohesion
in
a
new
and
land
we
must
never
forget
most
of
the
appropriate
heroes
and
their
legends
were
created
overnight
to
answer
immediate
needs
almost
always
with
conscious
aims
and
ends

needed

confederacy
their
roles
are
paralleled
by
those
of
and
many
many
more
the
scholar
as
he
looks
at
our
national
folklore
of
the
last
years
will
be
mindful
of
two
facts
of
the
legends
that
are
created
to
fan
the
fires
of
patriotism
are
essentially
propagandistic
and
are
not
folk
legends
at
all
concept
that
an
national
folklore
exists
is
itself
probably
another
propagandistic
legend
is
individually
created
art
that
a
homogeneous
group
of
people
preserve
vary
and
recreate
through
oral
transmission
has
come
to
mean
myths
legends
tales
songs
proverbs
riddles
superstitions
rhymes
and
such
literary
forms
of
expression
to
written
literature
and
often
remaining
temporarily
frozen
in
written
form
it
loses
its
vitality
when
transcribed
or
removed
from
its
oral
existence
it
may
exist
in
either
literate
or
illiterate
societies
it
assumes
a
role
of
true
cultural
importance
only
in
the
latter
its
propagandistic
and
commercial
haste
to
discover
our
folk
heritage
the
public
has
remained
ignorant
of
definitions
such
as
this
have
swept
subliterary
and
bogus
materials
like
tales
anecdotes
and
labor
union
songs
up
as
true
products
of
our
oral
tradition
have
we
remembered
that
in
the
melting
pot
of
the
hundreds
of
isolated
and
ethnic
regional
and
occupational
groups
did
not
fuse
into
a
homogeneous
national
unit
until
long
after
education
and
industrialization
had
caused
them
to
cast
oral
tradition
aside
as
a
means
of
carrying
culturally
significant
material
such
scholarly
facts
are
of
little
concern
to
the
man
trying
to
make
money
or
fan
patriotism
by
means
of
folklore
much
of
what
he
calls
folklore
is
the
result
of
beliefs
carefully
sown
among
the
people
with
the
conscious
aim
of
producing
a
desired
mass
emotional
reaction
to
a
particular
situation
or
set
of
situations
is
irrelevant
long
as
his
material
is
can
in
some
way
be
ascribed
to
the
masses
and
appears
democratic
to
his
audience
he
remains
satisfied
all
this
we
can
now
see
that
two
streams
of
development
run
through
the
history
of
folklore
the
one
side
we
have
the
university
professors
and
their
students
trained
in
methods
of
research
who
have
sought
out
collected
and
studied
the
true
products
of
the
oral
traditions
of
the
ethnic
regional
and
occupational
groups
that
make
up
this
nation
the
other
we
have
the
and
the
national
sentimentalists
who
have
been
willing
to
use
any
patriotic
frontier
western
or
colonial
material
few
of
the
artists
writers
movie
producers
dramatists
and
musicians
who
have
used
folklore
since
have
known
enough
to
distinguish
between
the
two
streams
even
in
the
most
general
of
ways
all
the
field
is
large
difficult
to
define
and
seldom
taught
properly
to
undergraduates
addition
this
country
has
been
settled
by
many
peoples
of
many
heritages
and
their
lore
has
become
acculturated
slowly
in
an
age
of
print
and
easy
communication
within
an
and
changing
society
problems
confuse
even
the
experts
that
matter
the
experts
themselves
are
a
mixed
breed
housewives
historians
and
such
by
profession
they
approach
their
discipline
as
amateurs
collectors
commercial
propagandists
analysts
or
some
combination
of
the
four
have
widely
varying
backgrounds
and
aims
have
little
esprit
de
corps
outlook
for
the
amateur
for
instance
is
usually
dependent
on
his
fondness
for
local
history
or
for
the
picturesque
love
of
folklore
has
romanticism
in
it
and
he
care
much
about
the
or
the
footnote
is
his
hobby
and
he
all
too
rightly
wishes
it
to
remain
as
such
amateur
is
closely
related
to
the
collector
who
is
actually
no
more
than
the
amateur
who
has
taken
to
the
field
collector
enjoys
the
contact
with
rural
life
he
hunts
folklore
for
the
very
field
and
stream
reasons
that
many
persons
hunt
game
and
only
rarely
is
he
acutely
concerned
with
the
meaning
of
what
he
has
located
both
these
types
the
amateur
and
the
collector
are
uncritical
and
many
of
them
distinguish
well
between
real
folklore
and
bogus
material
there
are
also
the
commercial
propagandists
and
the
analysts
one
dominated
by
money
the
other
by
scholarship
are
primarily
concerned
with
the
uses
that
can
be
made
of
the
material
that
the
collector
has
found
shudder
at
the
thought
of
proceeding
too
far
beyond
the
sewage
system
and
the
electric
light
lines
commercial
propagandist
who
afford
to
be
critical
gets
along
well
with
the
amateur
from
whom
he
feeds
but
he
frequently
steps
on
the
toes
by
refusing
to
keep
his
material
genuine
standards
are
of
course
completely
foreign
to
those
of
the
analyst
both
the
amateur
and
the
commercial
progandist
the
analyst
lacks
a
soul
lacks
appreciation
with
his
endless
probings
and
classifications
by
the
vicious
circle
of
the
university
promotion
system
the
analyst
looks
down
on
and
gets
along
poorly
with
the
other
three
groups
although
he
cannot
deny
his
debt
to
the
collector
knowledge
that
most
have
of
folklore
comes
through
contact
with
commercial
propagandists
and
a
few
energetic
amateurs
and
collectors
work
done
by
the
analysts
the
men
who
really
know
what
folklore
is
all
about
has
no
more
appeal
than
any
other
work
of
a
truly
scientific
sort
and
reaches
a
limited
learned
audience
want
books
that
will
sell
recording
studios
want
discs
that
will
not
seem
strange
to
ears
used
to
hillbilly
and
jazz
music
grade
and
high
schools
want
quaint
but
moral
material
analyst
is
apt
to
be
too
honest
to
fit
in
a
result
most
people
have
more
than
a
vague
idea
what
folklore
actually
is
they
see
it
as
a
potpourri
of
charming
moral
legends
and
patriotic
anecdotes
with
a
superstition
or
remedy
thrown
in
here
and
there
so
well
is
such
ignorance
preserved
by
the
amateur
and
the
that
even
at
the
college
level
most
of
the
folklore
courses
given
in
the
survive
on
sentiment
and
nationalism
alone
one
wishes
to
discuss
a
literary
figure
who
uses
folklore
in
his
work
the
first
thing
he
must
realize
is
that
the
literary
figure
is
probably
part
of
this
ignorant
public
while
every
writer
must
be
dealt
with
as
a
special
case
the
interested
student
will
want
to
ask
himself
a
number
of
questions
about
each
the
writer
know
the
difference
between
an
ersatz
ballad
or
tall
tale
and
a
true
product
of
the
folk
the
writer
uses
material
does
he
tamper
with
it
to
improve
its
commercial
effect
or
does
he
leave
it
pure
the
writer
propagandistic
he
swept
away
by
sentiment
and
nostalgia
for
an
that
was
does
he
sincerely
want
to
tap
the
real
springs
of
attitude
and
culture
regardless
of
how
unpopular
and
embarrassing
they
may
be
he
gets
the
answers
to
his
questions
he
will
be
discouraged
the
first
place
a
good
many
writers
who
are
said
to
use
folklore
do
not
unless
one
counts
an
occasional
superstition
or
tale
for
instance
writes
about
rural
life
in
but
he
does
not
include
any
significant
amount
of
folklore
in
his
poems
has
not
however
prevented
publishers
from
labeling
him
a
folk
poet
simply
because
he
is
a
rural
one
the
second
place
a
large
number
of
writers
making
a
more
direct
claim
than
to
being
folk
writers
of
one
sort
or
another
clearly
make
no
distinctions
between
genuine
and
bogus
material
comes
immediately
to
mind
in
this
connection
as
does
and
last
two
writers
introduce
strong
political
bias
into
their
works
and
not
unlike
the
union
leaders
that
we
will
discuss
soon
see
folklore
as
a
reservoir
of
protest
by
a
downtrodden
and
publically
silenced
mass
as
used
by
such
writers
really
reflects
images
engraved
into
it
by
the
very
person
using
it
folk
are
simply
not
homogeneous
with
respect
to
nation
or
political
attitude
fact
there
is
much
evidence
to
indicate
they
care
a
bit
about
anything
beyond
their
particular
regional
ethnic
and
occupational
limits
with
a
reading
public
that
longs
for
the
good
old
days
and
with
an
awareness
of
our
expanding
international
interests
it
is
easy
for
the
to
obtain
a
magnified
position
in
literature
by
use
of
all
sorts
of
real
or
fake
and
it
is
easy
for
the
and
to
support
their
messages
of
reform
by
reading
messages
of
reform
into
the
minds
of
the
folk
part
of
the

arrangement

kind
of
frozen
candour
into

a
round
frank
face
creased
in
a
jovial
grin
that
stayed
bleakly
in
place
even
when
he
was
pumping
bullets
into

three
guns
one
in
the
right
trouser
pocket
one
under
his
left
armpit

in

was
equally
lethal

dispassionately

him
with

was
never
brought
to

of

disliked

an
expert
florist
tenderly
dextrous
in

no
apparent
comprehension
of

humanity
into
right
guys
and
wrong

the
wrong
ones

was
always
willing
to
kill
and
trample
under

what
was
described
by
a
psychologist
as
a
sunny
brutality

with
a
heavy
list
to
the
right
as
that
leg
was
four
inches
shorter
than
the
other
but
the
lurch
did
not
reduce
his
feline
quickness
with
his
guns
thought
him
just
a
superior
sort
of
plugugly
but
he
was
in
fact
with
his
aggression
and
hostility
and
nerveless
indifference
to
risking
or
administering
pain
a

psychopath
was
also

this
time

dangerous

insolence
that
enraged
them
beneath

disturbed
by

was
a
nonsense
further
example
of
the
incompatible
difference
in
personalities
was
when
two
policemen
held
up
a
beer
convoy
on
a
street
and
demanded
to
let
it
through
of
the

the

he

no

out

with
a
gravel
voice
was
quiet
sharp
and
confident
had
enlisted
in
the
straight
out
of
high
school
and
had
immediately
set
about
learning
his
new
trade
was
no
weapon
could
not
take
apart
and
reassemble
could
lead
a
patrol
and
he
knew

he
had
taken

long
to
realize
that
he
had
to
carry
a
heavy
load
of
tradition
on
his
shoulders
as

of
what
made
the

lighter
was
the

for

final
proof
was
a
small
incident
happened
at
the
party
a
big
affair
for
a
regiment
which
had
gone
into
battle
for
over
of
a
century
to
the
strains
of
an
march
the
middle
of
the
party
looked
up
to
see

smiling
faces
bearing
down
upon
him
each
beaming
above

biggest
greenest
shamrock
he
had
ever
seen

belonged
to
his
wife
and
their
two
children
when
the
singing
began
it
was
the
who
sang
the
old
songs
the
best
there
was
an
occasional
chuckle
about
the
officer
from
singing
tearfully
about
the
ould
sod
no
one
really
thought
it
was
strange
like
the

through

no

that
was
one

most
beloved

in

got
the
spirit
of
set
out
to
keep
the

in
the

was
to
see
to
it
that

as

for

sharp
and
military
but
he
was
up
against
tough
competition
for
that
berth
and
he
wanted
to
play
it

set
out
to
sell
him
on
the

up

took
one

broke
into
a
trot
and
then
into
a
run
first
thing
he
knew
the
words
from
his
throat
followers
shouted
the
old
battle
cry
after
him
and
charged

as
they
ran
fell
back
but
regrouped
at

top
of

pinned
down
the
cavalrymen
with
a
screen
of
fire
looking
to
right
and
left
to
see
how
his
men
were
faring
suddenly
saw
another
figure
bounding
up
the
hill
hurling
grenades
and
hollering
the
battle
cry
as
he
ran

who
had
suddenly
found
himself
imbued
with
the

formed
his
own
task

of
three
stragglers
and
led
them
up

of
this
diversionary
attack
the
main

that
had
been
pinned
down
on
the

was
able
to
surge
forward
again
an

grenade
hit
in
the

and
detonated

down

his
men
following
the
bullets
whacked
home
before
he
finished
his
battle
cry
and
fell
dead
an
instant
his
men
hesitated
unable
to
believe
that
their
lieutenant
the
most
popular
officer
in

was
dead
they
let
out
a
bellow
of
anguish
and

probably
the
most
complete

of

just
one
example
of
how
the

the

never

to
rally

of
who
survived
the

the
enlisted

to
the
subordinate
officer
whose
wife
he
tried
to
rape
a
lot
of

plenty
of
reason
heartily
to
dislike
of
his
fellow
officers

to
speak
to
him
when
a
board
of
inquiry
was
called
to
look
into
the
charges
of
cowardice
made
against
him
the
men
who

had
heard

that
the
wounded
be

to
be
tortured
by
the

to
say
a
harsh
word
against
him
was
a
member
of
it
was
at
the
of
about
which
more
words
have
been
written
than
any
other
battle
in
history
that
the
first
made
its
mark
in
history
the
regiment
was
ten
years
old
by
then
was
the
first
permanent
commander
and
like
such
generals
as
and
in
their
rise
to
military
prominence
was
a
believer
in
blood
and
guts
warfare
the
who
achieved
a
brilliant
record
was
made
brigadier
general
at
the
age
of
finished
the
war
as
a
major
general
commanding
a
full
division
and
at
was
the
youngest
major
general
in
the
history
of
the
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
these
assumptions
are
in
the
sense
that
everyone
agrees
with
them
they
were
would
be
writing
the
same
columns
as
and
would
have
nothing
to
draw
cartoons
about
do
mean
however
that
take
them
for
granted
and
that
everything
shall
be
saying
would
appear
quite
idiotic
against
any
contrary
assumptions
ultimate
objective
of
policy
is
to
help
establish
a
world
in
which
there
is
the
largest
possible
measure
of
freedom
and
justice
and
peace
and
material
prosperity
and
in
particular
since
this
is
our
special
responsibility
that
these
conditions
be
enjoyed
by
the
people
of
the
speak
of
the
largest
possible
measure
because
any
person
who
supposes
that
these
conditions
can
be
universally
and
perfectly
achieved
ever
reckons
without
the
inherent
imperfectability
of
himself
and
his
fellow
human
beings
and
is
therefore
a
dangerous
man
to
have
around
conditions
are
unobtainable
are
not
even
approachable
in
the
qualified
sense
have
indicated
without
the
prior
defeat
of
world
is
true
for
two
reasons
because
is
both
doctrinally
and
in
practice
antithetical
to
these
conditions
and
because
have
the
will
and
as
long
as
power
remains
intact
the
capacity
to
prevent
their
realization
as
power
increases
the
enjoyment
of
these
conditions
throughout
the
world
diminishes
pro
rata
and
the
possibility
of
their
restoration
becomes
increasingly
remote
follows
that
victory
over
is
the
dominant
proximate
goal
of
policy
in
the
sense
that
there
are
more
distant
more
positive
ends
we
seek
to
which
victory
over
is
but
a
means
dominant
in
the
sense
that
every
other
objective
no
matter
how
worthy
intrinsically
must
defer
to
it
is
a
worthy
objective
but
if
we
must
choose
between
peace
and
keeping
the
out
of
then
we
must
fight
in
the
sense
of
is
a
worthy
objective
but
if
granting
to
the
rebels
entails
sweeping
that
area
into
the
orbit
then
freedom
must
be
postponed
is
a
worthy
objective
but
if
justice
for
entails
driving
the
government
of
the
of
away
from
the
then
the
must
be
prepared
to
carry
their
identification
cards
yet
a
while
longer
is
a
worthy
objective
but
if
providing
higher
standards
of
living
gets
in
the
way
of
producing
sufficient
guns
to
resist
aggression
then
material
sacrifices
and
denials
will
have
to
be
made
may
be
of
course
that
such
objectives
can
be
pursued
consisently
with
a
policy
designed
to
overthrow
my
point
is
that
where
conflicts
arise
they
must
always
be
resolved
in
favor
of
achieving
the
indispensable
condition
for
a
tolerant
world
the
absence
of
power
uses
of
power
much
having
been
said
the
question
remains
whether
we
have
the
resources
for
the
job
we
have
to
do
defeat
and
if
so
how
those
resources
ought
to
be
used
brings
us
squarely
to
the
problem
of
power
and
the
uses
a
nation
makes
of
power
submit
that
this
is
the
key
problem
of
international
relations
that
it
always
has
been
that
it
always
will
be
suggest
further
that
the
main
cause
of
the
trouble
we
are
in
has
been
the
failure
of
ever
since
we
assumed
free
world
leadership
in
to
deal
with
this
problem
realistically
and
seriously
the
recent
political
campaign
two
charges
were
leveled
affecting
the
question
of
power
and
think
we
might
begin
by
trying
to
put
them
into
proper
focus
was
demonstrably
false
the
other
for
the
most
part
true
first
was
that
had
become
or
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
military
power
know
do
not
have
to
dwell
here
on
the
absurdity
of
that
contention
may
have
misgivings
about
certain
aspects
of
our
military
establishment
certainly
do
but
you
know
any
comparison
of
strength
with
strength
finds
the
not
only
superior
but
so
superior
both
in
present
weapons
and
in
the
development
of
new
ones
that
our
advantage
promises
to
be
a
permanent
feature
of
relations
for
the
foreseeable
future
have
often
searched
for
a
graphic
way
of
impressing
our
superiority
on
those
who
have
doubts
and
think
has
done
it
well
in
his
new
book
he
says
that
the
tables
were
turned
and
we
were
in
the
position
would
be
more
than
modern
fighters
all
better
than
ours
stationed
at
bases
in
and
the
naval
power
would
always
be
within
a
few
hundred
miles
of
our
coast
of
the
population
of
the
would
be
needed
to
work
on
arms
just
to
feed
the
people
this
to
the
unrest
in
the
countries
around
us
where
oppressed
peoples
would
be
ready
to
turn
on
us
at
the
first
opportunity
also
a
comparatively
primitive
industrial
plant
which
would
severely
limit
our
capacity
to
keep
abreast
of
the
even
in
the
missile
field
which
is
reputed
to
be
our
main
strength
we
look
at
the
situation
this
way
we
can
get
an
idea
of
nightmarish
worries
or
at
least
of
the
worries
he
might
have
if
his
enemies
were
disposed
to
exploit
their
advantage
prestige
other
charge
was
that
political
position
in
the
world
has
progressively
deteriorated
in
recent
years
contention
needs
to
be
formulated
with
much
greater
precision
than
it
ever
was
during
the
campaign
but
once
that
has
been
done
fail
to
see
how
any
serious
student
of
world
affairs
can
quarrel
with
it
argument
was
typically
advanced
in
terms
of
prestige
however
is
only
a
minor
part
of
the
problem
and
even
then
it
is
a
concept
that
can
be
highly
misleading
is
a
measure
of
how
other
people
think
of
you
well
or
ill
contrary
to
what
was
implied
during
the
campaign
prestige
is
surely
not
important
for
its
own
sake
the
vain
and
incurably
sentimental
among
us
will
lose
sleep
simply
because
foreign
peoples
are
not
as
impressed
by
our
strength
as
they
ought
to
be
thing
to
lose
sleep
over
is
what
people
having
concluded
that
we
are
weaker
than
we
are
are
likely
to
do
about
it
evidence
suggests
that
foreign
peoples
believe
the
is
weaker
than
the
and
is
bound
to
fall
still
further
behind
in
the
years
ahead
ignorant
estimate
repeat
is
not
of
any
interest
in
itself
but
it
becomes
very
important
if
foreign
peoples
react
the
way
human
beings
typically
do
namely
by
taking
steps
to
end
up
on
what
appears
to
be
the
winning
side
the
extent
then
that
declining
prestige
means
that
other
nations
will
be
tempted
to
place
their
bets
on
an
ultimate
defeat
and
will
thus
be
more
vulnerable
to
intimidation
there
is
reason
for
concern
these
guesses
about
the
outcome
of
the
struggle
cannot
be
as
important
as
the
actual
power
relationship
between
the
and
ourselves
do
not
speak
of
military
power
where
our
advantage
is
obvious
and
overwhelming
but
of
political
power
of
influence
if
you
will
about
which
the
relevant
questions
are
influence
throughout
the
world
greater
or
less
than
it
was
ten
years
ago
is
influence
greater
or
less
than
it
used
to
be
gains
answering
these
questions
we
need
to
ask
not
merely
whether
troops
have
crossed
over
into
territories
they
did
not
occupy
before
and
not
merely
whether
disciplined
agents
of
the
are
in
control
of
governments
from
which
they
were
formerly
excluded
the
success
of
war
against
the
does
not
depend
on
such
spectacular
and
definitive
conquests
may
mean
merely
the
displacement
of
influence
political
warfare
we
must
remember
is
waged
insidiously
and
in
deliberate
stages
of
inviting
a
military
showdown
with
the
which
they
could
not
win
the
seek
to
undermine
power
where
the
nuclear
might
of
the
is
irrelevant
in
backwoods
guerrilla
skirmishes
in
mob
uprisings
in
the
streets
in
parliaments
in
clandestine
meetings
of
undercover
conspirators
at
the
on
the
propaganda
front
at
diplomatic
conferences
preferably
at
the
highest
level
understand
moreover
that
the
first
step
in
turning
a
country
toward
is
to
turn
it
against
the
typically
the
first
stage
of
a
takeover
is
to
neutralize
a
country
second
stage
is
to
retain
the
nominal
classification
of
neutralist
while
in
fact
turning
the
country
into
an
active
advocate
and
adherent
of
policy
this
may
be
as
far
as
the
process
will
go
goal
is
the
isolation
and
capture
not
of
but
of
the
and
this
purpose
may
be
served
very
well
by
countries
that
masquerade
under
a
neutralist
mask
yet
in
fact
are
dependable
auxiliaries
of

purposively

been

did
not

bring
down

moved

that

with

no

inaccurate

it

convey
how
isolated
she
feels
among
the
vast
army
of
the
nonobservant

of
the
significant
things
about

that

in

senior
years
they
generally
forego
their
athletic
pursuits
presumably
in
the
interest
of
better
academic
achievement
is
significant
too
that
the
older
interviewed
believed
unlike
the
younger
ones
that
students
tend
to
do
better
academically
than
their
gentile
counterparts
percentage
of

is
almost
as
high
as
that
of

are
different

the
dominant
one
for
boys
while

for
social
reasons
and
to
become
culturally
developed
of
the
significant
developments
in
life
is
that
the

then

of
the
reasons
for
the

is
that
a
great

urban
are
enabled
to
attend
local
colleges
at
modest
cost
is
particularly
true
in
large
centers
of

and
is
noteworthy
about
this
large
group
of
is
that
although
their
attitudes
hardly
differentiate
them
from
their
gentile

they
actually
lead
their
lives
in

cosmos
with
relatively

a

will
be
sent
to
an
school
if
financial
resources
warrant
it
while
the
daughter
will
attend
the
local
college
are
two
reasons
for
this
the
education
has
a
lower
priority
than
the
the
attitude

more
protective

consequence
of

better

in

cured
one

was
treated
by
putting
the

by
rubbing

made
by
combining
rye

into
a
poultice
poultice
was
made
from
the
inner
bark
of

veracious
woman
tells
me
she
has
used
thin
potato
parings
for
both
corns
and
calluses
on
her
feet
and
they
remove
the
pain
or
fire
common
cure
was
to
soak
the
feet
five
or
ten
minutes
in
warm
water
then
to
apply
a
solution
of
equal
parts
of
soda
and
common
brown
soap
on
a
kid
bandage
overnight
softened
the
skin
so
that
in
the
morning
when
the
bandage
was
removed
the
corn
could
be
scraped
off
and
a
bit
of
corn
plaster
put
on
were
many
cures
for
warts
young
girl
told
me
how
her
mother
removed
a
wart
from
her
finger
by
soaking
a
copper
penny
in
vinegar
for
three
days
and
then
painting
the
finger
with
the
liquid
several
times
wart
removal
method
was
to
rub
each
wart
with
a
bean
split
open
and
then
to
bury
the
bean
halves
under
the
drip
of
the
house
for
seven
days
gathered
in
the
mouth
after
a
sleep
was
considered
poisonous
wetting
a
wart
with
this
saliva
on
wakening
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
was
supposed
to
cause
it
to
disappear
after
only
a
few
treatments
and
strangely
enough
many
warts
did
just
that
wart
cure
was
to
wrap
it
in
a
hair
from
a
blonde
gypsy
was
to
soak
raw
beef
in
vinegar
for
hours
tie
it
on
the
wart
and
wear
it
for
a
week
simpler
method
was
to
tie
a
thread
tightly
around
the
wart
at
its
base
and
wear
it
this
way
know
this
worked
person
recommended
to
me
washing
the
wart
with
sulphur
water
another
said
it
should
be
rubbed
with
a
cut
potato
three
times
daily
common
method
was
to
cut
an
onion
in
two
and
place
each
half
on
the
wart
for
a
moment
the
onion
was
then
fastened
together
with
string
and
placed
beneath
a
dripping
eave
the
onion
decayed
so
did
the
wart
muscles
were
relieved
by
an
arnica
rub
sore
feet
by
an
herb
from
the
ubiquitous
herb
garden
or
by
soaking
the
feet
in
a
pan
of
hot
water
in
which
two
cups
of
salt
had
been
dissolved
cramps
one
person
tells
me
were
relieved
by
standing
barefoot
with
the
weight
of
the
body
on
the
heel
and
pressing
down
hard
does
give
relief
as
can
testify
doctor
prescribed
a
tablespoon
of
whiskey
or
brandy
before
each
meal
for
leg
cramps
in
the
back
of
the
leg
and
in
the
abdomen
were
prevented
from
reaching
the
upper
body
by
tying
a
rope
about
the
waist
sprains
and
swellings
one
pint
of
cider
vinegar
and
half
a
pint
of
spirits
of
turpentine
added
to
three
well
beaten
eggs
was
said
to
give
speedy
relief
for
the
wine
waiter
in
a
restaurant
always
an
inscrutable
plenipotentiary
unto
himself
the
genii
with
the
keys
to
unlock
the
gates
of
the
wine
world
are
dealer
and
the
foreign
shipper
or
negociant
who
in
turn
supplies
him
instances
where
both
of
these
are
persons
or
firms
with
integrity
the
situation
is
ideal
may
on
occasion
be
anything
but
that
by
cultivating
a
wine
dealer
and
accepting
his
advice
one
will
soon
enough
ascertain
whether
he
has
any
knowledge
of
wines
as
opposed
to
what
he
may
have
been
told
by
salesmen
and
promoters
and
better
yet
whether
he
has
a
taste
for
wine
by
spreading
purchases
over
several
wine
dealers
one
becomes
familiar
with
the
names
and
specialties
of
reputable
wine
dealers
and
shippers
abroad
is
important
because
despite
all
the
efforts
of
the
government
an
appreciable
segment
of
export
trade
in
wines
is
still
tainted
with
a
misrepresentation
approaching
downright
dishonesty
and
there
are
many
too
many
negociants
who
would
rather
turn
a
sou
than
amass
a
creditable
reputation
overseas
good
negociant
or
shipper
will
not
only
be
the
man
or
the
firm
which
has
cornered
the
wines
from
the
best
vineyards
or
the
best
parts
of
them
he
may
also
be
the
one
who
makes
and
bottles
the
best
blends
sound
wines
from
vineyards
generally
in
his
own
district
are
the
wines
the
themselves
use
for
everyday
drinking
for
even
in
virtually
no
one
drinks
the
on
a
basis
are
expensive
and
even
doting
palates
tire
of
them
certainly
in
the
case
of
the
beginner
or
the
comparatively
uninitiated
wine
drinker
the
palate
and
the
capacity
for
appreciation
will
not
be
ready
for
the
as
a
steady
diet
without
frequent
recourse
to
crus
of
less
renown
is
nothing
infra
dig
about
a
good
blend
from
a
good
shipper
of
them
are
very
delicious
indeed
and
there
are
many
good
ones
exported
unfortunately
along
with
others
not
so
good
and
worse
with
a
reputable
wine
dealer
and
constant
experimentation
steering
ever
from
the
known
to
the
unknown
are
the
requisites
waiters
are
something
else
again
especially
if
one
is
travelling
or
dining
out
a
great
deal
their
importance
mounts
of
them
the
world
over
operate
on
the
same
principle
by
which
justice
is
administered
in
and
some
other
countries
the
customer
is
to
be
considered
guilty
of
abysmal
ignorance
until
proven
otherwise
with
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
customer
himself
the
drinking
of
wine
and
happily
so
is
for
the
most
part
a
recondite
affair
for
manifestly
if
everyone
in
the
world
who
could
afford
the
best
wines
also
liked
them
the
supply
would
dry
up
in
no
time
at
all
is
the
only
valid
and
extenuating
argument
that
may
be
advanced
in
defense
of
the
reprehensible
attitude
of
the
common
wine
waiter
really
good
wine
waiter
is
paradoxically
the
guardian
and
not
the
purveyor
of
his
cellar
against
the
on
the
one
hand
with
an
always
exhaustible
supply
of
his
best
wines
and
on
the
other
by
a
clientele
usually
equipped
with
inexhaustible
pocketbooks
it
is
a
wonder
indeed
that
all
wine
waiters
are
not
afflicted
with
chronic
ambivalence
one
way
to
get
around
them
short
of
knowing
exactly
what
one
wants
and
sticking
to
it
is
to
frequent
a
single
establishment
until
its
wine
waiter
is
persuaded
that
one
is
at
least
as
interested
in
wine
as
in
spending
money
then
perhaps
will
he
reveal
his
jewels
and
his
bargains
bought
from
a
dealer
should
ideally
be
allowed
to
rest
for
several
weeks
before
it
is
served
is
especially
true
of
red
wines
and
a
practice
which
though
not
always
practicable
is
well
worth
the
effort
does
no
harm
for
wine
to
stand
on
end
for
a
matter
of
days
but
in
terms
of
months
and
years
it
is
fatal
stored
for
a
long
time
should
be
on
its
side
otherwise
the
cork
dries
and
air
enters
to
spoil
it
stacking
wine
on
its
side
in
a
bin
care
should
always
be
taken
to
be
sure
there
is
no
air
bubble
left
next
to
the
cork
bottles
such
as
have
a
way
of
rolling
around
in
the
bin
and
often
need
little
props
such
as
a
bit
of
cardboard
or
a
chip
of
wood
to
hold
them
in
the
proper
reclining
posture
much
dampness
in
the
cellar
rots
the
corks
again
with
ill
effects
best
rule
of
thumb
for
detecting
corked
wine
provided
the
eye
has
not
already
spotted
it
is
to
smell
the
wet
end
of
the
cork
after
pulling
it
if
it
smells
of
wine
the
bottle
is
probably
all
right
if
it
smells
of
cork
one
has
grounds
for
suspicion
rises
or
drops
in
temperature
are
bad
for
wine
they
age
it
prematurely
ideal
storage
temperature
for
long
periods
is
about
degrees
with
an
allowable
range
of
five
degrees
above
or
below
this
provided
there
are
no
sudden
or
frequent
changes
vibration
is
also
undesirable
consequently
wine
closet
or
cellar
should
be
away
from
machines
or
electrically
driven
furnaces
one
lives
near
a
subway
or
an
express
parkway
the
solution
is
to
have
wines
stored
with
a
dealer
and
brought
home
a
few
at
a
time
especially
daylight
is
always
bad
for
wine
in
all
though
there
is
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
expended
over
the
preparations
thought
necessary
for
ordinary
wine
drinking
many
people
go
to
extreme
lengths
in
decanting
chilling
or
warming
or
banishing
without
further
investigation
any
bottle
with
so
much
as
a
slightly
suspicious
cork
one
should
wish
to
deny
these
purists
the
obvious
pleasure
they
derive
from
all
this
and
to
give
fair
warning
where
warning
is
due
no
one
who
becomes
fond
of
wines
ever
avoids
acquiring
some
degree
of
purism
the
fact
remains
that
in
most
restaurants
including
some
of
the
best
of
and
and
the
bottle
is
frankly
and
simply
brought
from
the
cellar
to
the
table
when
ordered
and
all
the
conditioning
or
preparation
it
ever
receives
takes
place
while
the
chef
is
preparing
the
meal
white
wine
already
at
cool
cellar
temperature
may
be
adequately
chilled
in
a
bucket
of
ice
and
water
or
the
freezing
compartment
of
a
refrigerator
the
former
is
far
preferable
in
about
fifteen
minutes
for
those
who
live
in
a
winter
climate
there
is
nothing
better
than
a
bucket
of
water
and
snow
by
no
means
an
ideal
procedure
a
red
wine
may
similarly
be
brought
from
the
cellar
to
the
dining
room
and
opened
twenty
minutes
or
so
before
serving
time
may
be
a
bit
cold
when
poured
but
again
as
one
will
have
observed
at
any
restaurant
worth
its
salt
wine
should
be
served
in
a
large
glass
which
is
never
filled
more
than
half
full
this
way
red
wine
warms
of
itself
quite
rapidly
and
though
it
is
true
that
it
may
not
attain
its
potential
of
taste
and
fragrance
until
after
the
middle
of
the
meal
or
the
course
in
the
meantime
it
will
have
run
the
gamut
of
many
beguiling
and
interesting
stages
only
cardinal
sin
which
may
be
committed
in
warming
a
wine
is
to
force
it
by
putting
it
next
to
the
stove
or
in
front
of
an
open
fire
invariably
effaces
any
character
and
drives
its
fragrance
underground
should
not
be
forgotten
that
wines
mature
fastest
in
less
fast
in
full
bottles
slowly
in
and
slower
yet
in
double
and
respectively
old
red
wines
often
require
several
hours
of
aeration
and
any
red
wine
brought
from
the
cellar
within
half
an
hour
of
mealtime
should
be
uncorked
and
allowed
some
air
white
wines
never
wines
should
be
opened
when
served
having
been
previously
chilled
in
proportion
to
their
sweetness
or
should
be
very
cold
a
or
a
somewhat
less
cold
is
an
accepted
method
for
covering
up
the
faults
of
many
a
cheap
or
poor
white
wine
especially
a
dry
wine
and
certainly
less
of
a
crime
than
serving
a
wine
at
a
temperature
which
reveals
it
as
unattractive
fragrance
and
taste
of
any
white
wine
will
die
a
lingering
death
when
it
is
allowed
to
warm

does
not

though
that
a
red

improves
with

there
is
a
reasonable
limit
and
wines
kept

the

fine

a

white

nowadays
between

trouble
the

the

suggestion
that

no

not

he
heard
of

alibi
was
not

it
seemed
said
he
returned
from
the
visit
to
his
niece
on
the
streetcar
woman
in
the
house

the
niece
was

up
his

and
said
she
left
when
he
did
to

for
her
dinner

not
a
fashionable
town
dinner
hour
there
was
twelve
noon
this
woman
had
delayed
until
after
to
start
her
shopping
she
would
have
had
little
time
in
which
to
prepare
the
substantial
meal
that
was
eaten
at
dinner
in
those
days
is
possible
that
told
the
woman
it
was
but
it
could
have
been
earlier
since
she
did
serve
dinner
on
time
did
make
an
attempt
to
check
on
alibi
interviewed
the
conductor
of
the
streetcar
said
he
had
taken
but
the
man
did
not
remember
as
a
passenger
further
said
that
there
had
been
four
or
five
priests
riding
on
the
same
car
with
him
conductor
did
recall
having
priests
as
passengers
and
this
satisfied
police
although
the
conductor
also
pointed
out
that
in
heavily
there
were
priests
riding
on
almost
every
trip
the
streetcar
made
so
statement
really
proved
nothing
do
know
that
left
the
house
before
nine
testified
she
saw
him
leave
through
the
side
door
said
let
him
out
and
locked
the
screen
door
that
point
on
he
said
he
went
to
the
post
office
and
then
walked
leisurely
to
where
his
niece
was
staying
more
than
a
mile
away
met
nobody
he
knew
on
this
walk
is
no
accounting
of
his
movements
in
this
long
gap
of
time
which
covers
the
early
hours
when
was
killed
testified
that
while
he
was
having
breakfast
in
the
dining
room
told
the
servant
want
you
to
wash
these
windows
today
testimony
was
in
direct
contradiction
said
it
was
after
she
returned
from
her
vomiting
spell
in
the
back
yard
that
told
her
to
wash
the
windows
was
long
after
had
left
the
house
knowledge
of
what
told
could
indicate
that
he
had
returned
secretly
to
the
house
and
was
hidden
there
knew
the
house
fairly
well
he
had
been
there
on
two
previous
visits
during
the
past
three
or
four
months
alone
despite
attempts
to
show
that
the
house
was
locked
up
tighter
than
a
drum
this
was
not
true
screen
door
was
unlocked
for
some
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
while
was
sick
in
the
back
was
unlocked
all
the
time
she
was
washing
windows
could
have
returned
openly
while
was
sick
in
the
back
yard
and
gone
up
to
the
room
he
had
occupied
would
not
have
been
alarmed
if
she
saw
with
an
ax
or
hatchet
in
his
hand
had
been
to
the
farm
the
previous
day
and
he
could
have
said
they
needed
the
ax
or
hatchet
at
the
farm
would
have
had
no
reason
to
disbelieve
him
and
he
could
have
approached
close
enough
to
her
to
swing
before
she
could
cry
out
could
have
left
for
after
her
murder
and
made
it
in
plenty
of
time
by
using
the
streetcar
he
took
an
earlier
streetcar
than
the
on
his
return
he
could
have
arrived
at
the
house
shortly
after
came
home
in
the
barn
the
screen
door
unlocked
and
upstairs
in
her
attic
room
he
would
have
had
free
and
easy
access
to
the
house
the
second
murder
over
he
could
have
left
hidden
the
weapon
in
some
vacant
lot
or
an
abandoned
cistern
in
the
neighborhood
unconcerned
stroll
down
the
side
of
the
house
to
a
pear
tree
with
crowds
already
gathering
in
front
of
the
building
and
guarding
the
side
door
was
odd
was
no
close
examination
of
his
clothes
for
bloodstains
and
certainly
no
scientific
test
was
made
of
them
for
a
man
who
traveled
around
without
any
change
of
clothing
a
few
more
stains
on
his
dark
suit
may
very
well
have
gone
unnoticed
motive
may
have
been
the
mysterious
quarrel
there
was
no
financial
gain
for
in
the
murders
the
other
side
of
the
ledger
is
the
fact
that
he
did
see
his
niece
and
the
woman
with
whom
she
was
staying
time
would
have
been
shortly
after
the
murder
of
and
they
noticed
nothing
unusual
in
his
behavior
said
he
had
promised
to
return
in
time
for
dinner
and
that
was
close
to
the
time
when
he
did
turn
up
at
the
house
did
say
about
as
a
possible
suspect
in
his
essay
wrote
police
soon
ceased
to
look
upon
either
or
as
in
possession
of
guilty
knowledge
had
any
interest
in
the
deaths
indeed
it
was
probably
to
advantage
to
have
and
alive
he
and
were
exonerated
by
herself
was
his
complete
discussion
of
as
a
possible
suspect
disbelieved
almost
everything
said
and
read
a
sinister
purpose
into
almost
everything
she
did
he
happily
accepted
her
statement
about
as
the
whole
truth
felt
nothing
further
need
be
said
about
the
servant
girl
exoneration
speaks
of
is
not
an
exoneration
but
expression
of
her
opinion
as
reported
in
the
testimony
of
officer
had
asked
if
she
suspected
her
and
she
replied
she
think
he
did
it
because
he
left
the
house
before
the
murders
and
returned
after
them
asked
the
same
question
about
and
pointed
out
that
as
far
as
she
knew
had
gone
up
to
her
room
before
her
murder
and
came
down
when
she
called
her
actually
never
named
any
suspect
told
police
about
the
prospective
tenant
she
had
heard
quarreling
with
her
father
some
weeks
before
the
murders
but
she
said
she
thought
he
was
from
out
of
town
because
she
heard
him
mention
something
about
talking
to
his
partner
much
as
she
detested
she
also
did
not
accuse
him
the
inquest
she
was
asked
specifically
whether
she
knew
anybody
her
father
had
bad
feelings
toward
or
who
had
bad
feelings
toward
her
father
replied
know
of
one
man
that
has
not
been
friendly
with
him
have
not
been
friendly
for
years
who
this
was
she
named
statement
certainly
was
true
the
press
reported
the
same
facts
in
using
interview
but
did
not
suggest
at
the
inquest
that
was
the
killer
interviewed
who
as
a
boy
picked
up
pears
in
the
yard
asked
if
anybody
else
in
the
household
besides
and
had
been
under
any
suspicion
at
the
time
of
the
murders
said
he
had
not
heard
of
anybody
else
about
inquired
she
was
just
the
maid
there
he
replied
waving
a
hand
to
indicate
how
completely
unimportant
she
was
was
of
course
reflecting
the
opinion
that
existed
at
the
time
of
murders
somehow
manages
to
overlook
completely
the
fact
that
as
far
as
we
know
there
were
exactly
two
people
in
and
about
the
house
at
the
time
of
both
murders
and
the
officials
on
the
case
seem
to
have
been
afflicted
with
a
similar
myopia
as
far
as
was
concerned
although
records
in
police
files
contain
many
reports
of
servants
who
have
murdered
their
employers
it
is
no
longer
cricket
for
the
butler
to
be
the
killer
in
mystery
fiction
but
we
are
dealing
here
with
actual
people
in
real
life
and
not
imaginary
characters
and
situations
actions
of
should
be
examined
since
she
was
there
and
opportunity
did
exist
if
only
to
establish
her
innocence
are
also
other
factors
that
require
closer
examination
legend
as
it
exists
in
today
always
includes
the
solemn
assurance
that
returned
to
after
the
trial
with
a
big
bundle
of
cash
which
gave
her
for
keeping
her
mouth
shut
people
who
believe
and
retell
the
legend
have
apparently
never
troubled
to
read
the
trial
testimony
and
do
not
know
that
the
maid
changed
her
testimony
on
several
key
points
always
to
the
detriment
of

get
any
bundles
of
cash
the
last
person
who
would
have
rewarded
her
for
services
rendered
would
have
been
was
born
in
one
of
fourteen
children
was
apparently
the
pioneer
in
her
family
because
she
had
no
close
relatives

this
country

that
time

as
a
domestic

in

mother

clear

that
from
childhood

an
unusual
mind

an
observant
eye
a
retentive
memory
and
a
critical
faculty
she
was
nine
years
old
she
wrote
a
description
of

she
had
visited

and
said
there
were
many
more
things

appetite
for

from
a
younger
schoolmate
friend
of
her

later
like

of

two
weeks
behind
you

to

later

dabbling
in
for
years
studied
according

the
methods
of
that
day
exactly
forty
years
ago
in
a
summer
school
it
must
be
fascinating
to
take
up
zoology
in
the
way
you
are
doing
was
the
science
in
the
high
school
course
for
the
time

that

favorite

came
next
study

persistently
pursued

enjoyed
very
much
on

they

up

musical
talents
as
had
his
father
before
him
different
times

started

from

a
lively
part
of
the
household
she
had
physical
as
well
as
mental
vigor
as
his
daughters
and
recall
used
to
characterize
her
as
our
iron
sister
is
reason
to
suppose
that
would
have
made
a
record
as
publicly
distinguished
as
her
brother
had
it
not
been
that
her
death
occurred
just
as
she
was
about
to
enter
college

his
conviction

her
physical
strength
her
mental
power
her
lively
interest
in
all
objects
about
her

her
readiness
to

not
sufficiently
challenging

resigned

he
was
there
on
study

her
attention
to

a
cause
she
believed
in
correspondence
with

to
the
joy
of
and
she
came

wherever
needed

years
without

students
have
spoken
of
the
exacting
standards
of
scholarship
and
of
manners
and
conduct
she
expected

achieved
from
the
students
of
her
great
power
of
discernment
of
her
exquisiteness
of
dress
her
voice
that
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
the
hearers
her
great
love
of
flowers

her
close

on

her
resources
of

and
heart
to

and
as
graduates
gratefully
recall
she
drew
on
her
purse
as
well
a
student
was
able
to
remain
at
only
because
of
her
unobtrusive
help
the
work
of
the
year
went
forward
without
interruption
all
she
had
come
to
in
and
had
been
since
except
for
one
year
or
had
taught
classes
in
botany
astronomy
with
the
aid
of
a
telescope
geometry
and
psychology
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
had
many
tastes
in
common
had
eager
and
inquiring
minds
and
both
believed
that
intellectual
growth
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
development
of
sturdy
character
and
zeal
loved
the
including
mountain
climbing

horseback
riding

the
trip
to

was
arranged

who
planned
the
trip
and
with
rare
executive
ability
bore
the
brunt
of
the
entire
pilgrimage
from
beginning
to
end
strenuous
it
was
physically
with
its
days
of
horseback
riding
over
rough
roads
that
it
seems
an
amazing
feat
of
endurance
for
both
and
they
thrived
on
it
the
as
already
quoted

with
force
and
eloquence

and
unlimited
horizons

his
judgment

however
it
may
be
said
that
when
a

a

leaves

the
school
authorities
play
little
or
no

decision

complete

is

this
arrangement
or
lack
of
arrangement
works
out
quite
well
in
some
periods
of
our
history
and
in
some
neighborhoods
the
job
opportunities
have
been
so
good
that
undoubtedly
a
great
many
boys
who
were
potential
members
of
the
professions
quit
school
at
an
early
age
and
went
to
work
this
has
represented
a
loss
to
the
nation
although
one
must
admit
that
in
an
individual
case
the
decision
in
retrospect
may
have
been
a
wise
one
make
no
attempt
to
measure
the
enduring
satisfaction
and
material
of
a
man
who
went
to
work
on
graduation
from
high
school
and
was
highly
successful
in
the
business
which
he
entered
may
or
may
not
be
better
off
than
his
classmate
who
went
on
to
a
college
and
professional
school
in
the
next
decades
the
nation
needs
to
educate
for
the
professions
all
the
potential
professional
talent
a
later
chapter
dealing
with
the
suburban
school
shall
discuss
the
importance
of
arranging
a
program
for
the
academically
talented
and
highly
gifted
youth
in
any
high
school
where
he
is
found
the
neighborhoods
and
also
to
some
extent
in
the
mixed
neighborhoods
the
problem
may
be
one
of
identification
and
motivation
motivation
towards
higher
education
must
start
early
enough
so
that
by
the
time
the
boy
or
girl
reaches
grade
he
or
she
has
at
least
developed
those
basic
skills
which
are
essential
for
academic
work
far
more
can
be
done
in
the
lower
grades
in
this
regard
in
the
schools
the
teacher
can
only
go
so
far
if
the
attitude
of
the
community
and
the
family
is
the
fact
remains
that
there
are
today
few
shining
examples
of
in
positions
of
intellectual
leadership
is
not
due
to
any
policy
of
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
universities
the
contrary
as
can
testify
from
personal
experience
as
a
former
university
president
we
see
here
another
vicious
circle
absence
of
successful
in
the
world
of
scholarship
and
science
has
tended
to
tamp
down
enthusiasm
among
youth
for
academic
careers
believe
the
situation
is
improving
but
the
success
stories
need
to
be
heavily
publicized
again
we
run
into
the
roadblock
that
do
not
like
to
be
designated
as
in
the
press
can
the
vicious
circle
be
broken
is
a
problem
to
which
leaders
of
opinion
both
and
white
should
devote
far
more
attention
is
at
least
as
important
as
the
more
dramatic
attempts
to
break
down
barriers
of
inequality
in
the
education
should
like
to
underline
four
points
made
in
my
first
report
with
respect
to
vocational
education
and
foremost
vocational
courses
should
not
replace
courses
which
are
essential
parts
of
the
required
academic
program
for
graduation
vocational
courses
should
be
provided
in
grades
and
and
not
require
more
than
half
the
time
in
those
years
however
for
slow
learners
and
prospective
dropouts
these
courses
ought
to
begin
earlier
the
significance
of
the
vocational
courses
is
that
those
enrolled
are
keenly
interested
in
the
work
they
realize
the
relevance
of
what
they
are
learning
to
their
future
careers
and
this
sense
of
purpose
is
carried
over
to
the
academic
courses
which
they
are
studying
at
the
same
time
the
type
of
vocational
training
programs
should
be
related
to
the
employment
opportunities
in
the
general
locality
last
point
is
important
because
if
high
school
pupils
are
aware
that
few
if
any
graduates
who
have
chosen
a
certain
vocational
program
have
obtained
a
job
as
a
consequence
of
the
training
the
whole
idea
of
relevance
disappears
training
which
holds
no
hope
that
the
skill
developed
will
be
in
fact
a
marketable
skill
becomes
just
another
school
chore
for
those
whose
interest
in
their
studies
has
begun
to
falter
who
because
of
population
mobility
and
the
reputed
desire
of
employers
to
train
their
own
employees
would
limit
vocational
education
to
general
rather
than
specific
skills
ought
to
bear
in
mind
the
importance
of
motivation
in
any
kind
of
school
experience
have
been
using
the
word
vocational
as
a
layman
would
at
first
sight
think
it
should
be
used
intend
to
include
under
the
term
all
the
practical
courses
open
to
boys
and
girls
courses
develop
skills
other
than
those
we
think
of
when
we
use
the
adjective
academic
all
of
these
practical
skills
are
of
such
a
nature
that
a
degree
of
mastery
can
be
obtained
in
high
school
sufficient
to
enable
the
youth
to
get
a
job
at
once
on
the
basis
of
the
skill
are
in
this
sense
skills
marketable
immediately
on
graduation
from
high
school
be
sure
in
work
and
in
the
building
trades
the
first
job
must
be
often
on
an
apprentice
basis
but
two
years
of
vocational
training
enables
the
young
man
thus
to
anticipate
one
year
of
apprentice
status
a
girl
who
graduates
with
a
good
working
knowledge
of
stenography
and
the
use
of
clerical
machines
and
who
is
able
to
get
a
job
at
once
may
wish
to
improve
her
skill
and
knowledge
by
a
year
or
two
of
further
study
in
a
community
college
or
secretarial
school
course
it
can
be
argued
that
an
ability
to
write
correctly
and
with
some
degree
of
elegance
is
a
marketable
skill
too
is
the
mathematical
competence
of
a
college
graduate
who
has
majored
in
mathematics
a
sense
almost
all
high
school
and
college
courses
could
be
considered
as
vocational
to
the
extent
that
later
in
life
the
student
in
his
vocation
which
may
be
a
profession
will
be
called
upon
to
use
some
of
the
skills
developed
and
the
competence
obtained
spite
of
the
shading
of
one
type
of
course
into
another
believe
it
is
useful
to
talk
about
vocational
courses
as
apart
from
academic
courses
a
course
in
typewriting
might
be
regarded
as
the
exception
which
proves
the
rule
many
college
bound
students
try
to
take
a
course
in
personal
typing
as
they
feel
a
certain
degree
of
mastery
of
this
skill
is
almost
essential
for
one
who
proposes
to
do
academic
work
in
college
and
a
professional
school
of
our
largest
cities
have
one
or
more
separate
vocational
or
technical
high
schools
this
respect
public
education
in
the
large
cities
differs
from
education
in
the
smaller
cities
and
consolidated
school
districts
neighborhood
high
schools
are
not
strictly
speaking
comprehensive
schools
because
some
of
the
boys
and
girls
may
be
attending
a
vocational
or
technical
high
school
instead
of
the
local
school
one
school
superintendent
in
a
large
city
objects
to
the
use
of
the
term
comprehensive
high
school
for
the
senior
high
schools
in
his
city
because
these
schools
do
not
offer
strictly
vocational
programs
prefers
to
designate
such
schools
as
general
high
schools
suburban
high
school
it
is
worth
noting
also
is
not
a
widely
comprehensive
high
school
because
of
the
absence
of
vocational
programs
reason
is
that
there
is
a
lack
of
interest
on
the
part
of
the
community
employment
and
education
in
all
the
schools
in
a
metropolitan
area
are
related
in
different
ways
from
those
which
are
characteristic
of
the
comprehensive
high
school
described
in
my
first
report
separate
vocational
or
technical
high
schools
in
the
large
cities
must
be
reckoned
as
permanent
institutions
and
large
their
programs
are
satisfactorily
connected
both
to
the
employment
situation
and
to
the
realities
of
the
apprentice
system
is
not
often
realized
to
what
degree
certain
trades
are
in
many
communities
closed
areas
of
employment
except
for
a
lucky
few
has
to
talk
confidentially
with
some
of
the
directors
of
vocational
high
schools
to
realize
that
a
boy
cannot
just
say
want
to
be
a
plumber
and
then
by
doing
good
work
find
a
job
is
far
more
difficult
in
many
communities
to
obtain
admission
to
an
apprentice
program
which
involves
union
approval
than
to
get
into
the
most
selective
medical
school
in
the
nation
stories
will
illustrate
what
have
in
mind
vocational
instructor
in
a
city
vocational
school
speaking
of
his
course
in
a
certain
field
said
he
had
no
difficulty
placing
all
students
in
jobs
outside
of
the
city
the
city
he
said
the
waiting
list
for
those
who
want
to
join
the
union
is
so
long
that
unless
a
boy
has
an
inside
track
he
get
in
a
far
distant
part
of
the
was
talking
to
an
instructor
about
a
boy
who
in
the
twelfth
grade
was
doing
special
work
does
he
have
in
mind
to
do
when
he
graduates
be
a
plumber
came
the
answer
it
almost
impossible
to
get
into
the
union
asked
have
no
difficulty
was
told
has
very
good
connections
my
view
there
should
be
a
school
which
offers
significant
vocational
programs
for
boys
within
easy
reach
of
every
family
in
a
city
these
schools
should
be
so
located
that
one
or
more
should
be
in
the
area
where
demand
for
practical
courses
is
at
the
highest
excellent
example
of
a
successful
location
of
a
new
vocational
high
school
is
the
in

bad

its

tailored

the

a
common
byword
the

days
when
and
foreign
capital
were
so
eager
to
buy

interests
origin
of
this
was
credited
to
a
saloonkeeper
by
the
name
of
saloon

a
place
for
influential
cattlemen

one
year

when

after

paid

then
rode
out
and
tried

a

said
that
a
man
had
good
cow
sense
he
meant
to
pay
a
high
compliment
matter
by
what
name
cattle
were
called
there
was
no
that
they
not
only
saved
from
financial
ruin
but
went
far
toward
from
a
wilderness
vast
territories
of
the
a
wide
loop
the
first
use
of
the
word
rustler
was
as
a
synonym
for
hustler
an
established
term
for
any
person
who
was
active
and
in
any
enterprise
it
was
used
as
the
title
for
the
hoss
wrangler
and
when
the
order
was
given
to
go
out
and
rustle
the
hosses
it
meant
for
to
go
out
and
herd
in
the
hosses
was
spoken
of
as
hoss
and
the
wrangler
was
called
the
hoss
rustler
the
word
became
almost
exclusively
applied
to
a
cow
thief
from
the
days
of
the
maverick
when
cowhands
were
paid
by
their
employers
to
get
out
and
rustle
a
few
mavericks
was
who
found
the
lion
tracks
found
them
near
the
carcass
of
a
zebra
that
had
been
killed
the
night
before
and
he
circled
once
nose
to
the
ground
hair
shooting
up
along
his
back
as
it
did
when
he
was
after
lion
or
bear
and
then
he
lifted
his
head
and
bayed
and
the
pack
joined
in
all
heads
high
and
knew
it
was
a
hot
trail
stifled
the
yell
and
let
lead
him
straight
toward
the
nearby
black
volcanic
mountain
mountain
was
known
as
and
it
rose
almost
perpendicularly
for
about
two
hundred
feet
honeycombed
with
caves
top
covered
with
dense
scrub
and
creepers
and
tall
grass
the
south
it
ended
sharply
as
though
the
lava
had
been
cut
off
there
suddenly
and
had
started
the
day
together
while
followed
the
dogs
and
and
had
taken
another
route
and
now
with
the
discovery
of
the
fresh
trail
still
unknown
to
him
reined
in
in
the
shadow
of
the

pointed

said

the

they
watched
rode
straight
for
the
they
picked
up
the
smaller
black
specks
on
the
plain
in
front
of
him
dogs
were
working
a
trail
lion
pack
had
made
a
bend
to
the
north
swinging
back
toward
the
and
and
could
hear
them
faintly
got
off
and
tore
up
some
dry
grass
that
grew
in
cracks
between
the
rocks
and
piled
it
in
a
heap
and
wanted
to
make
the
smoke
signal
that
would
bring
and
and
the
rest
of
the
party
yet
cautioned
came
toward
them
fast
now
along
the
southern
toe
of
the
and
the
dogs
could
be
heard
plainly
with
his
voice
outstanding
above
the
others
was
too
also
a
veteran
of
the

and
the

a
pack
of
and
a

from

and
a

chosen
for

not

galloping
close
behind

leaning
down
cheering
them

said
and
touched
a
match
to
the
pile
of
grass
blew
on
it
and
flame
licked
out
threw
green
stuff
on
it
and
a
thin
blue
column
of
smoke
rose
will
fetch
the
gang
and
tell
the
where
we
are
quick
shots
sounded
there
was
a
chorus
of
wild
barking
and
baying
the
heavy
roar
of
a
lion
and
looked
at
each
other
and
began
to
gallop
toward
the
sound
came
from
the
top
of
the
not
half
a
mile
away
the
base
of
the
rocky
hillside
they
left
their
horses
and
climbed
on
foot
route
was
choked
with
rugged
creepers
and
bushes
so
thickly
overgrown
that
when
lost
sight
of
and
called
answered
from
ten
feet
away
country
to
meet
a
lion
in
face
to
face
and
climbed
on
toward
the
sound
of
the
barking
of
the
dogs
and
the
sporadic
roaring
of
the
lion
till
they
came
out
of
breath
to
the
crest
and
peering
through
the
branches
of
a
bush
this
is
what
saw
who
had
apparently
and
actually
had
ridden
up
the
nearly
impassable
hillside
sitting
calmly
on
his
horse
within
forty
feet
of
a
young
lioness
who
was
crouched
on
a
flat
rock
and
seemed
just
about
to
charge
him
while
the
dogs
whirled
around
her
drew
back
with
a
start
and
put
finger
to
lips
almost
afraid
to
move
or
whisper
lest
it
set
her
off
dogs
have
got
her
bayed
just
the
other
side
of
that
bush
when
they
had
drawn
back
a
step
he
added
is
sitting
on
his
horse
right
in
front
of
her
she
charge
him
know
he
even
got
a
knife
on
him
get
away
from
her
in
this
kind
of
ground
disturb
her
had
been
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
from
her
when
he
first
broke
through
to
the
top
of
the
was
standing
on
a
flat
rock
three
feet
above
ground
and
when
she
saw
him
she
rose
to
full
height
and
roared
opening
her
mouth
wide
lashing
her
tail
and
stamping
at
the
rock
with
both
forefeet
in
irritation
as
much
as
to
say
dare
you
disturb
me
in
my
sacred
precinct
told
him
however
that
she
was
tired
and
winded
from
the
run
up
the
and
would
not
charge
yet
moved
forward
to
within
feet
of
her
being
careful
because
he
knew
the
female
is
less
predictable
than
the
male
the
graveyard
at
he
had
been
shown
the
graves
of
big
game
hunters
killed
hunting
the
animals
he
was
attempting
to
lasso
the
seventeen
had
been
killed
by
lions
and
eleven
out
of
the
seventeen
by
lionesses
snarled
terribly
but
intuition
told
him
again
that
she
was
bluffing
and
he
could
see
that
half
her
attention
was
distracted
by
the
dogs
threw
the
lasso
was
falling
over
her
head
when
a
branch
of
a
bush
caught
it
and
it
fell
in
front
of
her
on
the
rock
then
if
she
took
one
step
forward
he
could
catch
her
nipped
her
rear
end
one
rear
end
was
as
good
as
another
to
no
matter
and
she
changed
ends
and
took
a
swipe
at
but
he
ducked
back
then
recoiled
his
rope
and
threw
again
this
time
hitting
her
on
the
back
but
failing
to
encircle
her
whirled
and
faced
him
roaring
terribly
and
watching
through
the
leaves
could
not
understand
why
she
did
not
charge
and
obliterate
him
because
he
have
much
of
a
chance
of
getting
away
in
that
thick
growth
but
she
seemed
just
a
trace
uncertain
while
on
the
other
hand
appeared
perfectly
confident
and
decided
perhaps
that
was
the
answer
the
point
of
view
this
strange
creature
on
the
back
of
another
creature
lashing
out
with
its
long
thin
paw
very
likely
appeared
as
something
she
could
not
at
first
cope
with
now
she
sank
lower
to
the
rock
roar
changed
to
a
growl
tail
no
longer
lashed
she
appeared
more
subdued
and
defeated
knew
she
was
growing
more
dangerous
was
rested
and
could
mount
a
charge
the
tip
of
her
tail
was
moving
as
she
crouched
and
she
was
treading
lightly
up
and
down
with
her
hind
feet
this
moment
and
arrived
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
with
their
horses
and
distracted
her
and
she
ran
off
a
short
distance
and
jumped
into
a
crevice
between
two
rocks
dogs
followed
her
and
she
killed
three
and
badly
wounded
got
to
get
her
out
of
there
yelled
or
kill
all
me
the
firecrackers
such
an
emergency
he
had
included
cannon
crackers
as
part
of
their
equipment
one
he
pitched
it
into
the
crevice
and
the
lioness
left
off
mauling
the
dogs
and
departed
she
a
beauty
though
out
as
she
ran
you
go
a
step
nearer
her
than
do
warned
and
if
you
do
go
at
a
run
so
have
momentum
two
hours
they
drove
her
from
one
strong
point
to
another
along
the
side
of
the
trying
to
maneuver
her
onto
the
plain
where
they
could
get
a
good
throw
she
clung
to
the
rocks
and
brush
and
the
day
wore
away
was
hot
dogs
were
tired
men
were
tired
too
was
the
story
of
the
rhinoceros
fight
all
over
again
the
sun
was
beginning
to
go
down
dark
came
they
would
lose
her
get
a
pole
said
finally
and
poke
a
noose
over
her
head
this
moment
she
was
crouched
in
a
aperture
halfway
down
the
made
no
comment
but
his
face
showed
what
he
thought
of
poking
ropes
over
heads
with
poles
and
of
course
these
were
the
lions
of
fifty
years
ago
not
the
gentler
ones
of
today
and
this
one
was
angry
with
good
reason
too
objected
work
the
same
try
it
without
waiting
for
them
to
try
it
she
scattered
the
dogs
and
shot
down
the
and
out
across
the
plain
led
the
chase
after
her
and
the
other
dogs
strung
out
behind
many
of
them
trailing
blood
himself
was
bruised
and
clawed
from
head
to
tail
but
he
was
in
this
fight
to
the
finish
running
almost
as
strongly
now
as
in
the
morning
took
refuge
on
a
tongue
of
land
extending
into
a
gully
crouched
at
the
base
of
a
thorn
tree
and
waited
for
them
to
come
up
had
chosen
the
spot
well
the
gully
on
three
sides
she
could
be
approached
only
along
the
tongue
of
land
now
warned
tried
her
first
slowly
he
maneuvered
his
rawboned
bay
gelding
edging
closer
watching
for
a
chance
to
throw
but
ready
to
spin
and
run
rope
whining
about
his
head
horse
edging
tensely
under
him
but
the
gelding
was
obedient
and
responded
and
was
not
paralyzed
by
the
close
proximity
of
the
lion
tell
you
horses
go
crazy
at
the
sight
or
smell
of
a
bear
or
a
lion
but
these
edged
closer
snarled
warningly
spit
and
edged
on
she
snarled
and
again
he
edged
pony
was
sidewise
to
her
a
whirling
jump
it
could
get
into
gear
nothing
on
four
legs
was
supposed
to
be
faster
than
a
lion
over
a
short
distance
unless
it
was
a
cheetah
charged
spun
and
spurred
thirty
yards
she
gained
rapidly
was
closing
and
within
one
more
bound
would
have
been
able
to
reach
the
rear
end
of
the
bay
but
and
here
and
and
were
holding
breath
for
all
they
were
worth
she
never
quite
caught
up
that
last
bound
held
steady
one
jump
ahead
of
her
gradually
he
began
to
pull
away
cowpony
had
outrun
an
lion
from
a
standing
start
showed
later
that
been
about
six
feet
from
course
the
factor
of
head
start
made
all
the
difference
much
head
start
one
knew
exactly
was
the
whole
question
was
the
answer
lioness
quickly
changed
front
when
she
saw
she
catch
and
made
for
she
had
done
with
she
gained
rapidly
at
first
but
then
began
to
draw
away
in
the
few
scant
yards
of
head
start
was
the
determining
point
too
drew
away
she
returned
to
a
thorn
bush
in
the
neck
of
land
running
into
the
gully
crouched
low
and
waited
as
before
new
position
however
gave
the
ropers
a
better
chance
was
room
to
make
a
quick
dash
past
the
bush
and
throw
as
you
went
edged
around
on
the
north
side
of
her
moved
in
from
the
south
his
rope
and
shouting
he
attracted
her
attention
succeeded
almost
too
well
because
once
she
rose
as
if
to
charge
and
he
half
wheeled
his
horse
he
was
within
fifty
feet
but
she
sank
back
behind
her
shot
forward
at
a
run
began
shouting
wait
the
jammed
kept
on
raced
by
within
twenty
feet
of
her
roped
her
around
the
neck
but
a
neck
is
short
and
thick
and
with
a
quick
twist
she
slipped
the
noose
off
missionary
obligation
to
proclaim
the
gospel
to
all
the
world
was
once
left
to
zealous
individuals
and
voluntary
societies
the
time
came
when
a
church
that
had
no
part
in
the
missionary
movement
was
looked
upon
as
deficient
in
its
essential
life
education
of
children
too
was
once
hardly
more
than
a
sideshow
but
the
day
came
when
a
congregation
that
did
not
assume
full
oversight
of
a
church
school
was
thought
of
as
failing
in
its
duty
most
serious
weakness
of
the
ecumenical
movement
today
is
that
it
is
generally
regarded
as
the
responsibility
of
a
few
national
leaders
in
each
denomination
and
a
few
interdenominational
executives
pastors
and
laymen
even
though
they
believe
it
to
be
important
assume
that
the
ecumenical
movement
lies
outside
the
province
of
their
parishes
may
even
dismiss
it
from
their
minds
as
something
that
concerns
only
the
ecclesiastical
as
someone
has
dubbed
them
who
like
to
go
to
national
and
international
assemblies
and
have
expense
accounts
that
permit
them
to
do
so
long
as
this
point
of
view
prevails
the
ecumenical
movement
will
be
lame
and
halt
next
stage
ahead
is
that
of
making
it
thoroughly
at
home
in
the
local
community
will
take
place
far
less
through
what
is
done
in
any
summit
conference
of
the
or
the
or
even
in
offices
of
the
denominational
boards
than
through
what
happens
in
the
communities
where
people
live
together
as
neighbors
front
line
of
advance
is
where
witnessing
and
worshiping
congregations
of
different
traditions
exist
side
by
side
they
see
the
ecumenical
movement
in
terms
of
the
difference
it
makes
in
their
own
attitudes
programs
and
relationships
it
will
have
an
inevitable
aspect
of
unreality
things
now
stand
there
is
a
grievous
disparity
between
the
unity
in
which
we
profess
in
ecumenical
meetings
and
the
complacent
separateness
of
most
congregations
on
any
in
the
nation
ecumenical
congregation
crux
of
ecumenical
advance
is
an
even
more
personalized
matter
than
the
relation
between
congregations
in
the
same
community
decisive
question
is
what
happens
within
each
congregation
and
finally
in
the
minds
and
hearts
of
the
individual
members
is
here
that
the
local
and
ecumenical
must
meet
is
here
that
the
ecumenical
must
become
local
and
the
local
become
ecumenical
has
become
almost
trite
to
say
that
the
ecumenical
movement
must
be
carried
down
to
the
grass
roots
way
of
describing
the
matter
is
unfortunate
implies
two
misconceptions
is
that
whatever
is
ecumenical
has
to
do
with
some
organization
at
the
top
and
needs
only
to
be
understood
at
the
lower
levels
truth
however
is
that
the
ecumenical
church
is
just
the
local
church
in
its
own
true
character
as
an
integral
unit
of
the
whole
of
throughout
the
world
other
misconception
is
that
our
ecumenical
problems
will
be
solved
if
only
the
knowledge
of
the
church
in
its
extension
and
its
interdenominational
connections
now
comprehended
by
many
national
leaders
can
be
communicated
to
all
congregations
needed
this
may
be
the
fundamental
problem
is
not
information

hardly
possible
to
emphasize
this

much
people
do
not
realize
that
the

as

meeting
regularly

personally

in

that
it

synagogue
affords
a
parallel
to

although
they
have
sacred
scriptures
priests
spiritual
disciplines
and
places
of

do
not
have
a

characteristic

is
that
of

at

than
that
of

far
the

local

falls
below
what
the

is
often
little
more
than
the
social
chumminess
of
having
a

the

of

with
whom
on
the
level
of
merely
human
agreeableness
we
might
prefer
not
to
have
any
association
at
all
is
a
vast
difference
between
the
community
of
reconciliation
which
the
describes
and
the
community
of
congeniality
found
in
the

the

little

at

are
ecumenists
who

so
stirred
by
the
crises
of
the
church
in
its
encounter
with
the

at

that
they
have
no

so
absorbed
in
the
conflict
of
the
church
with
the
totalitarian
state
in
the
precarious
situation
of
the
church

and
the
anguish
of

he

little
or
nothing
to

sense
of
social
responsibility
and

mission

result
they
go
on

of
the
church
with
introverted
and
satisfaction
only
in
connection
with
the
way
in
which
it
serves
them
and
their
families
would
hardly
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
ninety
per
cent
of
the
energy
of
most
churches
whether
in
terms
of
finance
or
spiritual
concern
is
poured
into
the
private
and
domestic
interests
of
the
members
parish
lives
for
itself
rather
than
for
the
community
or
the
world
gap
between
the
ecumenical
perspective
and
the
parish
perspective
appears
most
starkly
in
a
church
in
any
of
our
comfortable
suburbs
is
eminently
successful
according
to
all
conventional
standards
is
growing
in
numbers

its

refreshment
of

to

and

a

with
the
draws
young
people
into
the
circle
of
those
who
continue
the
life
of
the
church
from
generation
to
generation
it
is
easy
for
the
ecumenical
enthusiast
to
lose
sight
of
how
basic
all
this
is
what
is
this
church
doing
to
help
its
members
understand
their
roles
as
in
the
world
too
often
its
conception
of
parish
ministry
and
pastoral
care
includes
no
responsibility
for
them
in
their
relation
to
issues
of
the
most
desperate
urgency
for
the
life
of
mankind
is
not
stirring
them
to
confront
the
racial
tensions
of
today
with
the
mind
of
is
not
helping
them
face
the
moral
crisis
involved
in
the
use
of
nuclear
energy
is
not
making
them
sensitive
to
the
level
of
much
of
our
economic
and
industrial
life
is
raising
no
disturbing
question
as
to
what
stewardship
means
for
the
relationship
of
the
richest
nation
in
the
world
to
economically
underdeveloped
peoples
is
not
developing
an
awareness
of
the
new
kind
of
missionary
strategy
that
is
called
for
as
young
churches
emerge
in
and
put
it
bluntly
many
a
local
church
is
giving
its
members
only
what
they
consciously
want
is
not
disturbing
them
by
thoughts
of
their
responsibility
in
relation
to
the
world
shall
not
make
a
decisive
advance
in
the
ecumenical
movement
until
such
a
church
begins
to
see
itself
not
merely
as
a
haven
of
comfort
and
peace
but
as
a
base
of
witness
and
mission
to
the
world
is
a
humorous
but
revealing
story
about
a
rancher
who
owned
a
large
slice
of
and
who
wanted
to
have
on
it
everything
that
was
necessary
for
a
completely
pleasant
community
built
a
school
and
a
library
then
a
recreation
center
and
an
inn
to
fill
the
only
remaining
lack
he
selected
the
best
site
on
the
ranch
for
a
chapel
and
spared
no
expense
in
erecting
it
visitor
to
the
beautiful
little
building
inquired
you
belong
to
this
church
no
he
replied
this
church
belongs
to
me
story
reflects
the
way
too
many
people
feel
long
as
the
congregation
regards
the
church
as
our
church
or
the
minister
thinks
of
it
as
my
church
just
so
long
the
ecumenical
movement
will
make
no
significant
advance
must
first
be
a
deeper
sense
that
the
church
belongs
not
to
us
but
to
and
that
it
is
purpose
not
our
own
interests
and
preferences
that
determines
what
it
is
to
be
and
do
embodiment
of
the
whole
local
church
which
conceives
its
function
to
be
entirely
that
of
ministering
to
the
conscious
desires
and
concerns
of
its
members
tends
to
look
on
everything
ecumenical
as
an
extra
not
as
a
normal
aspect
of
its
own
life
as
a
church
would
doubtless
be
greatly
surprised
to
be
told
that
in
failing
to
be
ecumenical
it
is
really
failing
to
be
the
of
the
truth
according
to
the
is
that
every
local
church
has
its
existence
only
by
being
the
embodiment
of
the
whole
church
in
that
particular
place
a
crowd
came
out
to
see
some
fresh
kids
from
the
city
try
to
match
the
boys
from
the
neighboring
farms
and
buggies
and
wagons
and
chugging
kept
gathering
all
morning
until
the
edges
of
the
field
were
packed
thick
and
small
boys
kept
scampering
out
on
the
playing
field
to
make
fun
of
the
visitors
whose
pitcher
was
a
formidable
looking
young
man
with
the
only
baseball
cap
was
a
bitterly
fought
game
carrying
almost
as
much
grudge
as
a
fist
fight
with
no
friendliness
exhibited
between
the
teams
except
the
formal
politeness
that
accompanied
the
setting
forth
of
ground
rules
and
agreements
on
balls
that
went
into
the
crowd
pitch
in
the
game
brought
forth
a
howl
from
the
enraptured
audience
and
every
fly
ball
the
visitors
dropped
and
because
their
right
fielder
was
still
a
little
fuzzy
from
drink
they
dropped
many
called
forth
yelps
of
derision
one
point
in
the
game
when
the
skinny
old
man
in
suspenders
who
was
acting
as
umpire
got
in
the
way
of
a
thrown
ball
and
took
it
painfully
in
the
kidneys
he
lay
there
unattended
while
players
and
spectators
wrangled
over
whether
the
ball
was
dead
or
the
base
runners
were
free
to
score
was
typical
of
such
games
which
were
earnestly
played
to
win
and
practically
never
wound
up
in
an
expression
of
good
fellowship
the
visitors
after
losing
this
game
rode
along
the
village
streets
toward
home

youngsters
who
could
keep
abreast
of
them
for
a
moment
or
two

of

surely
the
national
game
in
those
days
even
though
professional
baseball
may
have
been
merely
a
business
broadcasts
had
not
begun
and
most
devotees
of
baseball
attended
the
games
near
home
in
the
town
park
or
a
pasture
with
perhaps
two
or
three
trips
to
the
city
each
season
to
see
the

the

the
men

look
forward
to
playing

for
money
in
a
dozen
different
places
even
if
they
failed
to
make
the
major
leagues

lad
with
a
modicum
of
skill
might
find
a
payday
awaiting
him

of

hundreds
of

six

played
two
or
three
times
a
week
throughout
the
summer
usually
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
before
an
earnest
and
partisan
audience

sorry
fact
about

that

better

just
as

had
when
baseball
was
new
women
had
always
attended
ball
games
in
small
numbers
it
was
the
part
of
a
dead
game
sport
in
the
early
years
of
the
twentieth
century
to
be
taken
out
to
the
ball
park
and
to
root

for
the
home
team
they
had
often
sat
in
patient
martyrdom
unable
even
to
read
the

which
sometimes
seemed
to
indicate
that
one
team
led
another
by
a
score
of
three
hundred
and
eighty
to
one
hundred
and
questions
women
asked
at
baseball
games
were
standard
grist
for
amateur
comedy
as
were
the
doings
of
women
automobile
drivers
for
every
grown
man
except
a
few
who
were
always
suspected
of
being
shy
on
virility
knew
at
least
the
fundamentals
of
baseball
just
as
every
male
in
this
era
liked
to
imagine
or
pretend
that
he
could
fight
with
his
fists
women
were
not
expected
to
know
that
the
pitcher
was
trying
not
to
let
the
batter
hit
the
ball
however
so
increased
the
interest
of
women
in
the
game
that
it
was
hardly
necessary
even
to
have
any
longer
to
enable
men
to
get

without

at
home
actually
began
to
appear
unaccompanied
in
the
stands
where
they
still
occasionally
ran
the
risk
of
coming
home
with
a
stain
on
a
clean
skirt
or
a
new
curse
word
tingling
their
ears
radio
broadcasts
themselves
were
often
so
patiently
informative
despite
the
baseball
jargon
that
girls
and
women
could
begin
to
store
up
in
their
minds
the
same
sort
of
random
and
meaningless
statistics
that
small
boys
had
long
learned
better
than
they
ever
did
their
lessons
in
school
conclusion
is
dependent
on
the
assumption
that
traditional
sex
mores
will
continue
to
sanction
both
premarital
chastity
as
the
ideal
and
the
double
standard
holding
females
primarily
responsible
for
preserving
the
ideal
discussion
of
this
involves
using
schema
of
identity
identity
diffusion
as
a
conceptual
tool
in
superimposing
a
few
common
denominators
onto
the
diverse
personality
and
family
configurations
of
the
unwed
mothers
from
whose
case
histories
we
quoted
earlier
discussion
does
not
utilize
all
the
identity
crises
postulated
by
but
is
intended
to
demonstrate
the
utility
of
his
theoretical
schema
for
studying
unwed
mothers
hope
thereby
to
emphasize
that
from
a
psychological
standpoint
the
effectual
prevention
of
illegitimacy
is
a
continuous
process
involving
the
socialization
of
the
female
from
infancy
through
adolescence
a
series
of
developmental
stages
that
begin
in
the
infancy
and
end
in
his
old
age
has
indicated
that
the
adolescent
is
faced
with
a
series
of
identity
crises
successful
and
positive
resolution
of
these
crises
during
adolescence
involves
an
epigenetic
principle
during
adolescence
the
positive
resolutions
in
each
area
of
identity
crisis
depend
to
a
considerable
degree
on
his
already
having
resolved
preliminary
and
preparatory
identity
crises
during
his
infancy
childhood
and
early
adolescence
schema
the
delinquent
behavior
in
this
case
her
unwed
motherhood
reflects
her
identity
diffusion
or
her
inability
to
resolve
these
various
identity
crises
positively
adolescent
experiences

in

diffusion
perspective
the
ability
to
plan
for
the
future
and
to
postpone
gratifying
immediate
wants
in
order
to
achieve
objectives
is
more
easily
developed
if
from
infancy
on
the
individual
has
been
able
to
rely
on
and
trust
people
and
the
world
in
which
she
lives
has
noted
that
unless
this
trust
developed
early
the
time
ambivalence
experienced
in
varying
degree
and
temporarily
by
all
adolescents
as
a
result
of
their
remembering
the
more
immediate
gratification
of
wants
during
childhood
while
not
yet
having
fully
accepted
the
planning
required
by
adulthood
may
develop
into
a
more
permanent
sense
of
time
diffusion
of
this
time
diffusion
ranges
from
a
sense
of
utter
apathy
to
a
feeling
of
desperate
urgency
to
act

polar
extremes
in
time
diffusion
were
indicated
in
some
of
the
comments
by
unwed
mothers
reported
in
earlier
chapters
of
these
mothers
apparently
feeling
a
desperate
urgency
made
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
commitments
in
love
and
sex
that
would
have
consequences
displayed
utter
apathy
and
indifference
to
any
decision
about
the
past
or
the
future
many
of
these
unwed
mothers
the
data
on
their
family
life
and
early
childhood
experiences
revealed
several
indications
and
sources
of
their
basic
mistrust
of
their
parents
in
particular
and
of
the
world
in
general
as
has
noted
the
failure
to
develop
preliminary
identities
during
infancy
and
childhood
need
not
be
irreversibly
deterministic
with
respect
to
a
given
area
of
identity
diffusion
in
his
or
her
adolescence
as
shown
in
some
females
originally
developed
such
trust
only
during
their
adolescence
through
the
aid
of
and
their
identification
with
the
specific
case
of
time
diffusion
we
must
emphasize
the
significance
of
the
earlier
development
of
mistrust
when
it
is
combined
with
the
inevitable
time
crisis
experienced
by
most
if
not
all
adolescents
in
our
society
and
with
the
failure
of
the
adolescent
period
to
provide
opportunities
for
developing
trust
adolescent
experiences
two
closely
related
crises
an
identity
consciousness
and
negative
identity
sense
of
and
the
freedom
to
experiment
with
different
roles
or
confidence
in
own
unique
behavior
as
an
alternative
to
conformity
is
more
easily
developed
during
adolescence
if
during
early
childhood
the
individual
was
permitted
to
exercise
initiative
and
encouraged
to
develop
some
autonomy
if
the
child
has
been
constantly
surrounded
during
nursery
and
early
school
age
by
peer
groups
inculcated
with
the
primacy
of
group
acceptance
and
group
standards
and
allowed
little
initiative
in
early
play
and
work
patterns
then
in
adolescence
her
normal
degree
of
vanity
sensitivity
and
preoccupation
with
whether
others
find
her
appearance
and
behavior
acceptable
will
be
compounded
ostensible
indifference
to
and
rebellion
against
suggestions
and
criticisms
by
anyone
except
peer
friends
during
adolescence
are
the
manifestations
in
her
adolescence
of
her
having
been
indoctrinated
in
childhood
to
feel
shame
if
not
guilt
for
failing
to
behave
in
a
manner
acceptable
to
and
judged
by
the
performance
of
her
and
peer
friends
be
different
is
to
invite
shame
and
doubt
and
it
is
better
to
be
shamed
and
criticized
by
parents
who
already
consider
one
different
and
difficult
to
understand
than
by
peers
who
are
also
experiencing
a
similar
groping
for
and
denial
of
adult
status
attitudes
of
some
unwed
mothers
quoted
in
revealed
both
considerable
preoccupation
with
being
accepted
by
others
and
a
marked
absence
of
appeared
to
regard
their
sexual
behavior
as
a
justifiable
means
of
gaining
acceptance
from
and
identification
with
others
but
very
few
seemed
aware
that
such
acceptance
and
identification

to
be
supplemented
with
more
enduring
and
stable
identification

with

identity

confronting
the

anticipation
of

capacity
to
anticipate

and
to
exercise
the

depends
on
the
degree
to
which

involves
the
progressively

a

design
rather
than
in
the
design
it
ought
to
be
childhood
experiences
are
sources
of
the
that
the
adolescent
needs
for
experimenting
with
many
roles
and
for
the
freedom
to
fail
sometimes
in
the
process
of
exploring
and
discovering
her
skills
and
abilities
she
has
not
had
such
experiences
the
normal
adolescent
degree
of
indecision
will
be
compounded
may
well
be
incapacitated
by
it
when
she
is
confronted
with
present
and
future
alternatives
whether
to
prepare
primarily
for
a
career
or
for
the
role
of
a
homemaker
whether
to
stay
financially
dependent
on
her
parents
or
help
support
herself
while
attending
school
whether
to
pursue
a
college
education

a
job
after
high
school
and
whether
to
attend
this
or
that
college
and
to
follow
this
or
that
course
of
study
has
noted
that
as
this
indecision
mounts
it
may
result
in
a
paralysis
of
workmanship
paralysis
may
be
expressed
in
the
starting
and
never
completing
many
jobs

and
courses
of

and
in
the
fact
that
she
bases
her
decisions
about

on
what
others
are
doing
rather
than
on

experiences
in

and
habits
within
a

have
considerable
significance
for
the
prevention
of
illegitimacy
excerpts
from
case
histories
presented
above
confirm
this
significance
though
through
different
facets
of
experience
example
some
unwed
mothers
had
had
no
work
experiences
household
chores
and
responsibilities
during
childhood
and
early
adolescence
they
subsequently
occupied
their
leisure
hours
in
searching
for
something
exciting
and
diverting
was
both
the
other
hand
some
unwed
mothers
had
had
so
much
work
and
responsibility
imposed
on
them
at
an
early
age
and
had
thus
had
so
little
freedom
or
opportunity
to
develop
autonomy
and
initiative
that
their
work
and
responsibilities
became
dull
and
unrewarding
burdens
to
be
escaped
and
rebelled
against
through
fun
and
experimentation
with
forbidden
sexual
behavior
adolescent
also
faces
the
identity
crisis
that
has
termed
ideological
polarization
diffusion
of
ideals
discussing
the
ways
this
crisis
is
germane
to
consderations
for
the
prevention
of
illegitimacy
we
shall
again
superimpose
concept
on
our
data
have
a
tendency
to
polarize
ideas
and
values
to
perceive
things
as
black
or
white
nuances
of
meaning
are
relatively
unimportant
tendency
is
perhaps
most
clearly
revealed
in
the
literature
on
religious
conversions
and
experiences
of
adolescents
has
postulated
that
such
ideological
polarization
temporarily
resolves
their
search
for
something
stable
and
definite
in
the
rapidly
changing
and
fluctuating
between
childhood
and
adulthood
provides
identification
with
an
idea
a
value
a
cause
that
cuts
through
or
even
transcends
the
multiple
and
ambivalent
identities
of
their
passage
from
child
to
adult
and
permits
their
forceful
and
overt
expression
of
emotion
positive
development
during
adolescence
of
this
capacity
to
think
and
to
feel
strongly
and
with
increasing
independence
and
to
identify
overtly
either
with
or
against
given
ideas
values
and
practices
depends
to
a
considerable
degree
on
both
previous
and
present
opportunities
for
developing
autonomy
initiative
and
adolescents
have
some
ideological
diffusion
at
various
developmental
stages
as
they
experience
a
proliferation
of
ideas
and
values
diffusion
is
most
pronounced
and
most
likely
to
become
fixed
however
in
those
who
have
had
no
or
very
minimal
opportunities
to
develop
the
autonomy
and
initiative
that
could
have
been
directed
into
constructive
expression
and
so
served
as
sources
of
developing
pronounced
ideological
diffusion
inability
to
identify
independently
with
given
ideas
and
value
systems
is
reflected
in
many
ways
example
it
is
evinced
by
the
adolescent
or
adult
whose
beliefs
and
actions
represent
primarily
his
rebellion
and
reaction
against
the
ideas
and
behavior
patterns
of
others
rather
than
his
inner
conviction
and
choice
is
mirrored
by
the
individual
whose
ideas
and
behavior
patterns
are
so
dependent
and
relativistic
that
they
always
coincide
with
those
of
the
individual
or
group
present
and
most
important
at
the
moment
another
sense
it
is
represented
in
the
arguments
of
the
true
believers
who
seek
to
disprove
the
validity
of
all
other
beliefs
and
ideas
in
order
to
retain
confidence
in
theirs
case
histories
provide
some
interesting
illustrations
of
ideological
diffusion
embodied
in
the
unwed
inability
to
identify
independently
a
given
value
system
or
behavior
pattern
and
her
subsequent
disinclination
to
assume
any
individual
responsibility
for
her
sexual
behavior
example
the
unwed
mothers
expressed
their
frustration
with
males
who
did
not
indicate
more
explicitly
what
it
is
they
really
want
from
a
girl
so
one
can
act
accordingly
were
disappointed
by
the
physical
and
emotional
hurt
of
premarital
sexual
intercourse
condemned
the
movie
script
writers
for
implying
that
sex
was
enjoyable
and
exhilarating
criticized
parents
for
never
having
emphasized
traditional
concepts
of
right
and
wrong
and
they
censured
parents
who
never
disciplined
and
were
too
permissive
or
who
never
explained
how
easy
it
was
to
get
pregnant
the
adult
world
there
are
a
number
of
rather
general
and
diffuse
sources
of
ideological
diffusion
that
further
compound
the
search
for
meaning
during
this
particular
identity
crisis
example
some
contemporary
writing
tends
to
fuse
the
good
guys
and
the
bad
guys
to
portray
the
weak
people
as
heroes
and
weakness
as
a
virtue
and
to
explain
or
even
justify
asocial
behavior
by
attributing
it
to
deterministic
psychological
familial
and
social
experiences
the
final
accounting
these
would
have
augmented
the
bill
for
both
sides
estimate
of
one
million
dollars
is
probably
not
excessive
the
huge
amount
of
money
consumed
by
the
litigation
which
many
regarded
as
wasteful
indirectly
contributed
to
constructive
changes
in
legal
procedure
duration
and
other
circumstances
of
the
case
made
it
a
flagrant
example
of
the
gross
abuses
of
patent
infringement
actions
suit
as
we
have
seen
came
before
the
courts
when
patent
attorneys
inventors
and
laymen
were
making
mounting
demands
for
reforms
in
the
patent
system
among
the
defects
they
singled
out
were
the
complicated
and
wearisome
procedures
in
equity
a
long
and
angry
footnote
to
his
opinion
had
lent
the
weight
of
judicial
condemnation
to
such
criticism
is
a
duty
said
not
to
let
pass
this
opportunity
of
protesting
against
the
methods
of
taking
and
printing
testimony
in
current
in
this
circuit
and
probably
others
excused
if
not
justified
by
the
rules
of
the
especially
to
be
found
in
patent
causes
and
flagrantly
exemplified
in
this
litigation
long
as
the
bar
prefers
to
adduce
evidence
by
written
deposition
rather
than
viva
voce
before
an
authoritative
judicial
officer
fear
that
the
antiquated
rules
will
remain

think
have
a
fairly
accurate
notion
of
what
the
in

were
thinking

intended
to
be
there
myself
was
my
first
reaction
upon
hearing
of
death
was
curious
about
the
impact
of
this
political
assassination
on

captured
the
popular
imagination
there
was
curious
to

death
which
is
surely
among
the
most
sinister
of
recent
events
would
elicit
from
our
side
anything
more
than
the
usual
rhetoric
was
curious
about
the
reaction
the
chaos
on
my
desk
prevented
my
being
in
the
gallery
been
there
too
in
the
eyes
of
most
would
have
been
merely
a
pawn
in
the
hands
of
the
climate
and
the
events
of
the
last
decade
and
the
steady
pressure
of
the
cold
war
have
given
yet
another
means
of
avoiding
and
so
it
has
been
decided
that
the
riots
were
inspired
was
it
long
naturally
before
prominent
rushed
forward
to
assure
the
republic
that
the
rioters
do
not
represent
the
real
feeling
of
the
community
then
to
what
take
to
be
the
prevailing
view
these
rioters
were
merely
a
handful
of
irresponsible
provocateurs
find
this
view
amazing
is
a
view
which
even
a
minimal
effort
at
observation
would
immediately
contradict
has
only
for
example
to
walk
through
and
ask
oneself
two
questions
first
question
is
like
to
live
here
the
second
question
is
those
who
now
live
here
move
out
answer
to
both
questions
is
immediately
obvious
one
takes
refuge
in
the
theory
however
disguised
that
are
somehow
different
from
white
people
do
not
see
how
one
can
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
status
in
this
country
is
not
only
a
cruel
injustice
but
a
grave
national
liability
do
not
doubt
that
among
the
people
at
the
that
day
there
were
and
professional
revolutionists
acting
out
of
the
most
cynical
motives
there
is
great
social
discontent

people

sooner
or
later
to
be
found

is
not
as
frightening
as
the
discontent
which
creates
their
opportunity

appalling
and
really
dangerous
is
the
assumption
that
the
is
so
contented
with
his
lot
here
that
only
the
cynical
agents
of
a
foreign
power
can
rouse
him
to
protest

a
notion
which
contains
a
gratuitous
insult

it

the
film
improved
and
it
improved
because
in
narrative
it
found
a
content
based
on

to
complement
its
own
unbreakable
connection
with
time
a
movie
is
possible
because
a
series
of
images
is
projected
one
at
a
time
at
such
a
speed
that
the
eye
remembers
the
one
that
has
gone
before
even
as
it
registers
the
one
now
appearing
the
smoothly
changing
images
together
the
eye
itself
endows
them
with
the
illusion
of
movement
projection
time
of
painting
and

is
highly
subjective
varying
from

to

and
even
varying
for
a
given
person
on
different
occasions
is
the
time
of
the
novel
drama
in
the
theater
and
the
concert
in
the

both
have
a
fixed
time
but
the
time
is
fixed
by
the
director
and
the
players
the
conductor
and
the
instrumentalists
subject
therefore
to
much
variation
as
record
collectors
well
know
time
of
the

is
fixed
absolutely
film
consists
of
a

the

time

also
the

of
the

which
is
at
its

the

of
an

with
usually
a

a

which

is
to
be
sure
more
intense
than
a

of
the

but
the
difference
is
really
one
of
degree
the
cinematic
element
of

is
merely
used
to
increase
the

of

which
would
still

narrative
time

essential
as
it

in

everything
about

that

derives
from
a
tension

maintained
between
narrative

discovery
of
was
vastly
more
important
than

however
who
produced
the
very
first
movie
whose
name
has
lived
on
through
the
half
century
of
film
history
that
has
since
ensued
movie
was
and
its
effects
on
the
young
industry
and
art
were
all
but
incalculable
for
one
thing
film
multiplied
the
standard
running
time
of
movies
by
ten
is
a
film
reel
from
eight
to
twelve
minutes
became
the
standard
length
from
the
year
of
until
shattered
that
limit
forever
with
in
reel
itself
became
and
still
is
the
standard
of
measure
for
the
movies
material
of
the
film
is
simplicity
itself
much
of
it
has
continued
to
be
used
over
the
years
and
the
heart
of
it
good
guys
and
bad
guys
in
the
old
pretty
well
dominated
television
toward
the
end
of
the
band
of
robbers
enters
a
railroad
station
overpowers
and
ties
up
the
telegraph
operator
holds
up
the
train
and
escapes
posse
is
formed
and
pursues
the
robbers
who
having
made
their
escape
are
whooping
it
up
with
some
wild
wild
women
in
a
robbers
run
from
the
take
cover
in
a
wooded
declivity
and
are
shot
dead
by
the
posse
a
finale
is
appended
a
of
one
of
the
band
taking
aim
and
firing
his
revolver
straight
at
the
audience
this
is
simple
enough
but
in
telling
the
story
did
two
important
things
that
had
not
been
done
before
scene
is
shot
straight
through
as
had
been
the
universal
custom
from
a
camera
fixed
in
a
single
position
but
in
the
outdoor
scenes
especially
in
the
capture
and
destruction
of
the
outlaws
camera
position
breaks
necessarily
with
the
camera
position
standard
until
then
which
had
been
roughly
that
of
a
spectator
in
a
center
orchestra
seat
at
a
play
plane
of
the
action
in
the
scene
is
not
parallel
with
the
plane
of
the
film
in
the
camera
or
on
the
screen
the
change
at
first
sight
seems
minor
we
may
recall
that
it
took
the
painters
about
two
hundred
years
to
make
an
analogous
change
and
the
painters
by
universal
consent
were
the
most
brilliant
group
of
geniuses
any
art
has
seen
that
apparently
simple
shift
opened
the
way
to
the
sensitive
use
of
the
camera
as
an
instrument
of
art
as
well
as
a
mechanical
recording
device
did
more
than
that
revealed
the
potential
value
of
the
cut
as
the
basic
technique
in
the
art
of
the
film
of
course
takes
place
automatically
in
the
creation
of
a
film
meaning
of
the
word
is
quite
physical
to
begin
with
physical
film
is
cut
with
a
knife
at
the
end
of
one
complete
sequence
and
the
cut
edge
is
joined
physically
by
cement
to
the
cut
edge
of
the
beginning
of
the
next
sequence
as
a
home
movie
maker
you
shoot
the
inevitable
footage
of
your
child
taking
its
first
steps
you
have
merely
recorded
an
historical
event
in
preparing
that
shot
for
the
inevitable
showing
to
your
friends
you
interrupt
the
sequence
to
paste
in
a
few
frames
of
the
grandmother
watching
this
event
you
have
begun
to
be
an
artist
in
film
you
are
employing
the
basic
technique
of
film
you
are
cutting
is
what
did
the
robbers
leave
the
looted
train
the
film
suddenly
cuts
back
to
the
station
where
the
little
daughter
arrives
with
her
dinner
pail
only
to
find
him
bound
on
the
floor
dashes
around
in
alarm
two
events
are
taking
place
at
the
same
time
and
space
have
both
become
cinematic
leap
from
event
to
event
including
the
formation
of
the
posse
even
though
the
events
in
reality
are
taking
place
not
in
sequence
but
simultaneously
and
not
near
each
other
but
at
a
considerable
distance
chase
as
a
standard
film
device
probably
dates
from
and
there
is
a
reason
for
the
continued
popularity
of
the
device
chase
in
itself
is
a
narrative
it
presumes
both
speed
and
urgency
and
it
demands
cutting
both
from
pursued
to
pursuer
and
from
stage
to
stage
of
the
journey
of
both
simple
naked
idea
of
one
man
chasing
another
is
of
its
nature
better
fitted
for
the
film
than
it
is
for
any
other
form
of
fiction
cowboy
films
the
cops
and
robbers
films
and
the
slapstick
comedy
films
culminating
in
an
insane
chase
are
not
only
catering
to
what
critics
may
assume
to
be
a
vulgar
taste
for
violence
these
films
and
these
sequences
are
also
seeking
out
instinctively
or
by
design
the
peculiarly
cinematic
elements
of
narrative
creator
of
the
art
of
the
film
still
remained
the
need
for
one
great
film
artist
to
explore
the
full
potential
of
the
new
form
and
to
make
it
an
art
man
was
he
came
to
the
movies
more
or
less
by
accident
they
were
still
cheap
entertainment
capable
of
enthralling
the
unthinking
for
an
idle
few
minutes
about
seven
years
either
invented
or
first
realized
the
possibilities
of
virtually
every
resource
at
the
disposal
of
the
film
maker
he
was
forty
had
created
the
art
of
the
film
that
there
had
not
been
attempts
mostly
to
do
exactly
that
in
general
the
efforts
to
make
an
art
of
the
entertainment
had
ignored
the
slowly
emerging
language
of
the
film
itself
condensed
versions
of
famous
novels
and
famous
plays
were
presented
actors
and
actresses
the
most
notable
being
were
hired
to
repeat
their
stage
performances
before
the
camera
all
of
this
extensive
and
expensive
effort
the
camera
was
downgraded
to
the
status
of
recording
instrument
for
art
work
produced
elsewhere
by
the
actor
or
by
the
author
phonograph
today
for
all
its
high
fidelity
and
stereophonic
sound
is
precisely
what
the
early
art
purveyors
in
the
movies
wished
to
make
of
the
camera
surprisingly
this
approach
did
not
work
effort
produced
a
valuable
record
of
stage
techniques
in
the
early
years
of
the
century
and
some
interesting
records
of
great
theater
figures
who
would
otherwise
be
only
names
no
art
at
all
was
born
of
the
art
effort
in
the
early
movies
general
religious
interest
seems
to
exist
in
all
parts
of
the
metropolis
congregational
membership
however
is
another
thing
congregation
survives
only
if
it
can
sustain
a
socially
homogeneous
membership
that
is
when
it
can
preserve
economic
integration
faith
can
be
considered
a
necessary
condition
of
membership
in
a
congregation
since
the
decision
to
join
a
worshiping
group
requires
some
motive
force
but
faith
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
for
joining
the
presence
of
other
members
of
similar
social
and
economic
level
is
the
sufficient
condition
breakdown
of
social
homogeneity
in
inner
city
areas
and
the
spread
of
inner
city
blight
account
for
the
decline
of
central
city
churches
cities
reveal
two
adverse
features
for
the
major
denominations
central
cities
tend
to
be
areas
of
residence
for
lower
social
classes
central
cities
tend
to
be
more
heterogeneous
in
social
composition
central
city
areas
in
other
words
exhibit
the
two
characteristics
which
violate
the
life
principle
of
congregations
of
the
major
denominations
they
have
too
few
people
they
mix
people
with
residents
city
areas
have
become
progressively
poorer
locales
for
the
major
denominations
since
the
exodus
of
people
from
most
central
cities
few
exceptions
the
major
denominations
are
rapidly
losing
their
hold
on
the
central
city
key
to
development
therefore
is
economic
integration
of
the
nucleus
of
the
congregation
of
higher
and
lower
social
status
often
cluster
around
this
nucleus
so
that
figures
on
social
class
give
the
impression
of
spread
over
all
social
classes
but
this
is
deceptive
for
the
core
of
membership
is
concentrated
in
a
single
social
and
economic
stratum
congregation
perishes
when
it
is
no
longer
possible
to
replenish
that
core
from
the
neighborhood
moreover
residential
mobility
is
so
high
in
metropolitan
areas
that
churches
have
to
recruit
constantly
in
their
core
stratum
in
order
to
survive
they
can
lose
and
members
from
the
church
without
collapsing
but
they
need
adequate
recruits
for
the
core
stratum
in
order
to
preserve
economic
integration
congregation
is
first
and
foremost
an
economic
peer
group
it
is
secondarily
a
believing
and
worshiping
fellowship
it
were
primarily
a
believing
fellowship
it
would
recruit
believers
from
all
social
and
economic
ranks
something
which
most
congregations
of
the
with
a
few
notable
exceptions
have
not
been
able
to
do
survive
only
when
they
can
recruit
social
and
economic
peers
vulnerability
of
congregations
to
social
differences
has
often
been
attributed
to
the
folksy
spirit
of
religious
life
in
fact
a
contrast
is
often
drawn
in
this
regard
with
the
impersonal
parish
have
seen
that
the
folksy
spirit
is
confined
to
economic
peers
consequently
the
vulnerability
to
social
difference
should
not
be
attributed
to
the
stress
on
personal
community
in
congregations
actually
there
is
little
evidence
of
such
personal
community
in
congregations
as
we
shall
see
in
another
connection
vulnerability
of
to
social
differences
stems
from
the
peculiar
role
of
the
new
religious
style
in
life
where
the
congregation
is
a
vehicle
of
social
and
economic
group
identity
and
must
conform
therefore
to
the
principle
of
economic
integration
fact
is
evident
in
the
recruitment
of
new
members
as
rule
of
economic
integration
in
congregational
life
can
be
seen
in
the
missionary
outreach
of
the
major
denominations
is
much
talk
in
theological
circles
about
the
as
and
the
theologians
have
been
stressing
the
fact
that
the
does
not
exist
for
its
own
sake
but
as
a
testimony
in
the
world
for
the
healing
of
the
world
crucial
question
therefore
is
what
evangelism
and
mission
actually
mean
in
metropolitan
economic
integration
really
shapes
congregational
life
then
evangelism
should
be
a
process
of
extending
economic
integration
task
of
a
congregation
would
be
defined
according
to
economic
integration
as
the
work
of
individuals
and
families
of
similar
social
and
economic
position
to
replenish
the
nuclear
core
of
the
congregation
means
to
choose
by
joint
action
in
order
to
fill
a
vacancy
it
can
also
mean
the
assimilation
of
centers
of
power
from
an
environment
in
order
to
strengthen
an
organization
a
mobile
society
congregational
health
depends
on
a
constant
process
of
recruitment
this
recruitment
however
must
follow
the
pattern
of
economic
integration
or
it
will
disrupt
the
congregation
therefore
the
recruitment
or
missionary
outreach
of
the
congregation
will
be
rather
than
proclamation
like
elements
will
have
to
be
assimilated
and
congregational
outreach
have
not
been
carefully
studied
in
the
churches
one
study
in
however
has
illuminated
the
situation
a
sample
of
new
members
of
churches
almost
per
cent
were
recruited
by
initial
contacts
with
friendly
members
we
add
to
these
contacts
with
friendly
members
the
contacts
with
an
organization
of
the
church
per
cent
of
the
cases
then
a
substantial
two
thirds
of
all
recruitment
is
through
friendly
contact
the
surface
this
seems
a
sound
approach
to
mission
members
of
the
congregation
show
by
their
friendly
attitudes
that
they
care
for
new
people
the
new
people
respond
in
kind
by
joining
the
church
outreach
by
friendly
contact
looks
somewhat
different
when
one
reflects
on
what
is
known
about
friendly
contact
in
metropolitan
neighborhoods
the
majority
of
such
contacts
are
with
people
of
similar
social
and
economic
position
association
by
level
of
achievement
is
the
dominant
principle
of
informal
relations
means
that
the
antennae
of
the
congregation
are
extended
into
the
community
picking
up
the
wave
lengths
of
those
who
will
fit
into
the
social
and
economic
level
of
the
congregation
the
mission
of
the
church
is
actually
a
process
of
informal
the
lay
ministry
is
a
means
to
recruit
people
who
will
strengthen
the
social
class
nucleus
of
the
congregation
can
be
strengthened
through
this
process
of
so
long
as
the
environs
of
the
church
provide
a
sufficient
pool
of
people
who
can
fit
the
pattern
of
economic
integration
once
the
pool
of
recruits
diminishes
the
congregation
is
helpless
friendly
contacts
no
longer
keep
it
going
transmutation
of
mission
to
is
further
indicated
by
the
insignificance
of
educational
activities
worship
preaching
and
publicity
in
reaching
new
members
proclamation
of
the
churches
is
almost
totally
confined
to
pastoral
contacts
by
the
clergy
per
cent
of
new
members
and
friendly
contacts
by
members
over
two
thirds
if
organizational
activities
are
included
accounted
for
per
cent
of
the
initial
contacts
with
new
members
general
friendly
contact
with
a
member
followed
by
contact
with
a
clergyman
will
account
for
a
major
share
of
recruitment
by
the
churches
making
it
quite
evident
that
the
extension
of
economic
integration
through
is
the
principal
form
of
mission
in
the
contemporary
church
economic
integration
and
are
the
two
methods
by
which
associate
with
and
recruit
from
the
neighborhood
inner
life
of
congregations
will
prosper
so
long
as
people
of
similar
social
and
economic
level
can
fraternize
together
the
outer
life
of
congregations
the
suitability
of
the
environment
to
their
survival
will
be
propitious
so
long
as
the
people
in
the
area
are
of
the
same
social
and
economic
level
as
the
membership
integration
ceases
when
the
social
and
economic
statuses
in
an
area
become
too
mixed
or
conflict
with
the
status
of
the
congregation
a
rapidly
changing
society
congregations
will
run
into
difficulties
repeatedly
since
such
nice
balances
of
economic
integration
are
hard
to
sustain
in
the
metropolis
for
more
than
a
single
generation
fact
that
metropolitan
churches
of
the
major
denominations
have
moved
approximately
every
generation
for
the
last
hundred
years
becomes
somewhat
more
intelligible
in
the
light
of
this
struggle
to
maintain
economic
balance
expense
of
this
type
of
organization
in
religious
life
when
one
recalls
the
number
of
city
churches
which
deteriorated
beyond
repair
before
being
abandoned
raises
fundamental
questions
about
the
principle
of
survival
in
a
mobile
society
nonetheless
the
prevalence
of
economic
integration
in
congregations
illumines
the
nature
of
the
development
was
observed
in
the
introductory
chapter
that
metropolitan
life
had
split
into
two
trends
expanding
interdependence
on
an
impersonal
basis
and
growing
exclusiveness
in
local
communal
groupings
trends
seem
to
be
working
at
in
the
metropolis
associations
struggle
to
insulate
themselves
against
intrusions
motifs
of
impersonal
interdependence
and
insulation
of
residential
communities
have
polarized
the
schism
between
central
city
and
suburb
and
blue
collar
and
white
collar
can
be
viewed
as
symptomatic
of
this
deeper
polarization
of
trends
in
the
metropolis
now
becomes
evident
that
the
denominational
church
is
intimately
involved
with
the
economy
of
culture
for
it
serves
to
crystallize
the
social
class
identity
of
residential
groupings
accelerated
pace
of
metropolitan
changes
has
accentuated
the
drive
to
conformity
in
congregations
of
the
major
denominations
conformity
represents
a
desperate
attempt
to
stabilize
a
hopelessly
unstable
environment
than
creatures
of
metropolitan
forces
the
churches
have
taken
the
lead
in
counteracting
the
interdependence
of
metropolitan
life
crystallizing
and
perpetuating
the
stratification
of
peoples
giving
form
to
the
struggle
for
social
homogeneity
in
a
world
of
heterogeneous
peoples
life
is
committed
above
all
to
productivity
and
a
higher
standard
of
economic
life
the
countervailing
forces
of
residential
and
religious
exclusiveness
have
fought
a
desperate
rearguard
action
against
the
expanding
interdependence
of
the
metropolis
communities
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
productive
interests
and
rural
newcomers
are
slowly
making
their
way
into
the
cities
they
will
fight
their
way
into
the
lower
suburbs
and
the
churches
will
experience
the
same
decay
and
rebuilding
cycle
which
has
characterized
their
history
for
a
century
identification
of
the
basic
unit
of
religious
organization
the
parish
or
congregation
with
a
residential
area
is
in
a
modern
metropolis
for
it
simply
means
the
closing
of
an
iron
trap
on
the
outreach
of
the
fellowship
and
the
transmutation
of
mission
to
to
the
metropolis
contradicts
survival
of
the
congregation
in
the
residential
community
because
the
middle
classes
are
fighting
metropolitan
interdependence
with
residential
exclusion
interpretation
of
the
role
of
residence
in
the
economy
of
culture
could
lead
to
various
projections
for
the
churches
could
be
argued
that
any
fellowship
which
centers
in
residential
neighborhoods
is
doomed
to
become
an
expression
of
the
panic
for
stable
identity
among
the
middle
classes
could
be
argued
that
only
such
neighborhoods
can
sustain
religious
activity
since
worship
presupposes
some
local
stabilities
projection
one
makes
the
striking
fact
about
congregational
and
parochial
life
is
the
extent
to
which
it
is
a
vehicle
of
the
social
identity
of
people
will
be
given
in
the
next
chapter
to
the
style
of
association
in
the
denominational
churches
this
style
is
characteristically
an
expression
of
the
communal
style
of
the
middle
classes
keynotes
of
this
style
are
activism
and
emphasis
on
achievements
in
gaining
values
give
direction
to
the
life
of
the
man
or

of

rearing

the
iron

of

another
matter

they

the
kinds

pursued
by
the
congregation

on

the
cage

occupy
our
attention
under
the
rubric
of
the
organization
church
understanding
of
the
new
role
of
residential
association
in
an
industrial
society
serves
to
illuminate
the
forces
which
have
fashioned
the
iron
cage
of
conformity
which
imprisons
the
churches
in
their
suburban
captivity
perplexing
question
still
remains
as
to
why
the
middle
classes
turn
to
the
churches
as
a
vehicle
of
social
identity
when
their
clubs
and
charities
should
fill
the
same
need
capital
largely
squandered
there
seemed
to
them
no
other
course
to
pursue
directors

directly
to
concessionaires
who
had
to
make
their
profits
above
the
high
prices
asked
by

where
they
wished

generally
dealt
with
the

might
be

has
recognized
the
dilemma
and
is

to
devise
some
moral

for

the

often
have
no

conviction

are
confused

told
that
it

quite
likely
that
soldiers
would
not
fight
again
for

will
be
painful

interesting
to
see
what
kind
of

these

will
create

what
strong
convictions
they
will
develop

evening
the
former
science

met
for
dinner
at
the
where
had
my
first
raw
fish
and
found
it
good
suggested
several
new
foods
and
usually
found
them
good
except
the
sweets
which
think
could
learn
to
like
of

were
present
and
we
had
great
fun

me
on

at

instead

at

very
warm
welcome

rooms
on
the
trip
were
arranged
by
and
the
and
were
more
elegant
than
would
have
chosen
but
it
was
fun
for
once
to
be
elegant
did
explain
to
the
students
however
that
this
was
not
my
usual
style
for
their
salaries
are
very
small
and
it
seemed
out
of
place
for
me
to
be
housed
so
well
understood
and
teased
me
a
bit
about

would
have
been
much
disappointed
in
if
had
not
seen

her
son
a
prospective
student
with
whom
have
been
corresponding
for
more
than
a
year
and
one
of
the
science
teachers
arrived
at
and
by
had
finished
breakfast
and
was
on
my
way
to
see
what
they
had
planned
walked
miles
and
saw
various
shrines
and
gardens
visited
the
home
where
for
the
first
time
saw
the
famous
tea
ceremony
we
went
to
the
dances
at
the
place

amazed
at
the
very
poor

facilities
accompanying
the
medical
school
apologized
for
the
condition
including
dirt
and
flies
and
was
a
little
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
say
seemed
to
be
no
excuse
have
the
answer
yet
had
tea
at
home
where
learned
that
he
too
comes
from
a
very
wealthy
family
grandfather
is
a
priest
and
he
being
the
eldest
was
supposed
to
be
a
priest
but
he
chose
to
do
differently
and
one
of
his
brothers
is
to
become
the
priest
is
a
significant
fact
in
for
only
a
few
years
ago
he
would
have
had
no
choice
his
big
home
live
four
families
and
thirty
people
so
it
needs
to
be
big
there
are
housed
here
some
priceless
historical
treasures
from
to
years
old
paintings
lacquer
brocade
had
displayed
more
of
them
than
usual
so
that
could
enjoy
them
of
the
most
important
items
he
had
already
given
to
the
museum
house
itself
is
years
old
with
all
the
craftsmanship
of
older
times
and
went
with
me
on
the
train
to
passed
his
house
and
school
on
the
way
stayed
at
the
hotel
where
the
and
had
stayed
on
their
honeymoon
new
red
carpet
had
been
laid
for
their
coming
but
walked
on
it
too
met
us
after
a
train
trip
from
the
town
where
he
teaches
though
we
had
walked
miles
in
that
day
we
started
out
again
to
see
at
night
the
evening
both
of
the
men
went
with
me
on
the
train
miles
to
to
put
me
on
the
train
for
the
plan
was
for
me
to
go
alone
but
they
let
me
had
to
leave
us
to
get
the
train
to
his
home
but
and
had
an
hour
and
a
half
before
train
time
to
see
at
night
is
the
second
largest
city
in
with
about
four
million
people
spot
in
shall
always
remember
the
bridge
where
we
stood
to
watch
the
reflections
of
the
elaborate
neon
signs
in
the
still
waters
of
the
river
the
midst
of
a
great
busy
city
people
take
time
to
enjoy
the
beauty
of
natural
reflection
of
artificial
light
train
arrived
in
at
the
awful
hour
of
had
planned
to
go
to
the
hotel
by
taxi
and
sleep
a
little
after
which
would
arrive
and
pilot
me
around
there
he
was
at
the
train
with
an
pennant
in
his
hand
know
now
why
the
students
insisted
that
go
to
even
when
told
them
want
to
knew
that
was
still
grieving
over
the
tragic
event
and
they
felt
that
if
could
see
the
recovery
and
the
spirit
of
the
people
who
hold
no
grudge
but
who
also
regret
would
be
happier
and
would
understand
better
a
new
were
no
words
to
say
this
but
there
was
no
need
teachers
of
school
gave
me
a
small
gift
to
thank
me
for
coming
is
a
better
city
than
it
was
before
in
the
minds
of
the
people
met
was
a
strong
determination
for
peace
and
understanding
was
grateful
for
their
insight
into
my
need
for
this
experience
better
world
may
yet
come
out
of
arriving
in
later
we
were
met
by
who
took
us
immediately
to
her
university
the
day
was
for
day
and
the
girls
were
busy
preparing
exhibits
and
arranging
tea
tables
was
in
an
exciting
turmoil
full
of
anticipation
and
fun
was
thrilling
to
see
the
effect
of
an
teacher
on
students
in
a
class
in
is
one
of
the
very
few
architects
in
who
is
trying
to
plan
homes
around
family
functions
and
needs
am
told
the
time
will
soon
come
when
women
will
find
it
necessary
to
do
most
of
their
own
work
and
even
now
it
is
important
to
have
conveniences
for
the
use
of
servants
of
the
features
of
the
homes
are
the
latest
modern
devices
in
homes
but
an
interesting
blend
of
cultures
finds
us
using
artfulness
in
our
own
architecture
at
the
same
time
that
the
are
adopting
utility
patterns
this
we
find
a
monument
to
a
courageous
family
who
believed
that
women
also
should
be
educated
today
there
are
some
doubts
about
the
value
of
education
for
women
but
this
continues
to
grow
and
to
send
its
students
out
into
the
community
alumnae
have
built
a
fine
building
on
the
campus
where
members
can
come
and
stay
for
a
few
days
or
longer
and
where
they
can
have
their
social
gatherings
and
professional
meetings
far
as
am
concerned
there
is
continuous
piling
up
of
evidence
that
the
creative
fresh
ideas
which
are
needed
in
the
world
are
going
to
be
found
by
educated
women
unafraid
to
break
traditions
is
also
teaching
in

and

of
course
be
applauded
for
it
to
be
just
to
attain
this
same
result
by
means
of
the
force
of
a
boycott
throughout
the
nation
would
require
the
verification
of
facts
contrary
to
those
assumed
in
the
foregoing

suppositions
in
the
previous
illustration
might
be
sufficiently
altered
by
establishing
a
connection
between
general
company
practice
and
local
practice
in
the
and
by
establishing
such
direct
connection
between
the
practice
and
the
economic
of
stores
located
in
and
general
company
policy
the
boycott
would
not
be
secondary
but
a
primary
one
would
be
directed
against
the
actual
location
of
the
unjust
policy
which
for
sake
and
for
the
sake
of
justice
must
be
removed
and
indivisible
from
this
to
the
economic
injury
of
the
people
directly
and
objectively
a
part
of
this
policy
this
would
be
sufficient
to
justify
an
economic
boycott
of
an
entire
national
chain
in
order
by
threatening
potential
injury
to
its
entire
economy
to
effect
an
alteration
of
the
policy
of
its
local
stores
in
the
matter
of
segregation
a
general
boycott
might
still
be
a
blunt
or
indiscriminating
instrument
and
therefore
of
questionable
justification
located
where
the
evil
is
concentrated
will
prove
most
decisive
and
is
most
clearly
legitimate
prudence
alone
would
indicate
that
unless
the
local
customs
are
already
ready
to
fall
when
pushed
the
results
of
direct
economic
action
everywhere
upon
national
chain
stores
will
likely
be
simply
to
give
undue
advantage
to
local
and
state
stores
which
conform
to
these
customs
leading
to
greater
decentralization
and
local
autonomy
within
the
company
or
even
as
the
final
of
an
unjust
application
of
economic
pressure
to
correct
injustice
to
its
going
out
of
business
in
certain
sections
of
the
country
as
for
that
matter
the
who
once
had
many
meetings
in
the
largely
went
out
of
business
in
that
part
of
the
country
over
the
slavery
issue
never
to
recover
a
large
number
of
southern
adherents
any
case
anyone
who
fails
to
make
significant
distinction
between
primary
and
secondary
applications
of
economic
pressure
would
in
principle
already
have
justified
that
use
of
economic
boycott
as
a
means
which
broke
out
a
few
years
ago
or
was
skillfully
organized
by
in
the
entire
state
of
against
every
local
dealer
in
that
state
in
protest
against
a
program
over
a
national
network
on
which
was
presented
a
drama
showing
it
seemed
a
high
yellow
gal
smooching
with
a
white
man
is
true
of
course
that
the
end
or
objective
of
this
action
was
different
since
this
is
a
world
in
which
people
disagree
about
ends
and
goals
and
concerning
justice
and
injustice
and
since
in
a
situation
where
direct
action
and
economic
pressure
are
called
for
the
justice
of
the
matter
has
either
not
been
clearly
defined
by
law
or
the
law
is
not
effectively
present
there
has
to
be
a
morality
of
means
applied
in
every
case
in
which
people
take
it
upon
themselves
to
use
economic
pressures
or
other
forms
of
force
need
that
we
not
give
unqualified
approval
to
any
but
a
limited
use
of
economic
pressure
directed
against
the
actual
doers
of
injustice
is
clear
also
in
light
of
the
fact
that
seem
resolved
to
maintain
segregation
mainly
by
the
use
of
these
same
means
and
not
ordinarily
by
physical
violence
unlimited
use
of
economic
pressures
for
diametrically
opposite
causes
could
devastate
the
of
any
fellow
humanity
as
surely
as
this
would
be
destroyed
by
the
use
of
more
obviously
brutal
means
end
or
aim
of
the
action
of
course
is
also
important
especially
where
it
is
not
alone
a
matter
of
changing
community
customs
but
of
the
use
of
deadly
economic
power
to
intimidate
a
person
from
stepping
forward
to
claim
his
legal
rights
against
who
register
to
vote
in
at
the
present
moment
the
recourse
is
in
steps
to
give
economic
sustenance
to
those
being
despoiled
and
to
legal
remedies
however
is
sufficient
to
show
that
more
or
less
resistance
and
economic
conflict
if
both
sides
are
strong
enough
can
be
war
of
all
against
all
no
less
than
if
other
means
are
used
is
also
sufficient
to
show
the
and
any
other
champion
of
justice
that
he
needs
to
make
sure
not
only
that
his
cause
is
just
but
also
that
his
conduct
is
just
that
if
economic
pressure
has
to
be
resorted
to
this
be
applied
directly
against
those
persons
directly
in
the
way
of
some
salutary
change
in
business
or
institutional
practices
while
if
injury
fall
upon
others
it
fall
upon
them
indirectly
and
secondarily
however
inevitably
and
not
by
deliberate
intent
and
direct
action
against
them
is
clear
that
resistance
is
a
mode
of
action
in
need
of
justification
and
limitation
in
morality
like
any
other
form
of
resistance
language
used
itself
often
makes
very
clear
that
this
is
only
another
form
of
struggle
for
victory
perhaps
to
be
chosen
above
all
others
of
the
leaders
has
said
from
the
top
of
to
the
bottom
of
can
stop
the
march
to
freedom
in
the
world
today
might
as
well
make
up
their
minds
to
march
with
freedom
or
freedom
is
going
to
march
over
them
present
writer
certainly
agrees
with
that
statement
and
would
also
affirm
this
in
the
order
of
justice
it
is
also
a
insight
to
know
that
unless
charity
interpenetrates
justice
it
is
not
likely
to
be
freedom
that
marches
forward
when
charity
interpenetrates
struggle
for
justice
and
freedom
it
does
not
simply
surround
this
with
a
sentimental
good
will
also
definitely
fashions
conduct
in
the
way
explained
above
and
this
means
far
more
than
in
the
choice
of
means
has
written
that
and
good
will
of
the
victim
act
like
the
lack
of
physical
opposition
by
the
user
of
physical
to
cause
the
attacker
to
lose
his
moral
balance
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
loses
the
moral
support
which
the
usual
violent
resistance
of
most
victims
would
render
him
and
again
that
the
object
of
resistance
is
partly
analogous
to
this
object
of
war
namely
to
demoralize
the
opponent
to
break
his
will
to
destroy
his
confidence
enthusiasm
and
hope
another
respect
it
is
dissimilar
for
resistance
demoralizes
the
opponent
only
to
in
him
a
new
morale
that
is
firmer
because
it
is
based
on
sounder
values
trial
of
strength
however
is
made
quite
inevitable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
anyone
engaging
in
resistance
will
be
convinced
that
his
action
is
based
on
sounder
values
than
those
of
his
opponent
and
in
warfare
with
any
means
men
commonly
disagree
over
the
justice
of
the
cause
makes
necessary
a
morality
of
means
and
principles
governing
the
conduct
of
resistance
whenever
this
is
thought
to
be
justified
question
then
is
whether
sufficient
discrimination
in
the
use
of
even
means
of
coercion
is
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
such
conduct
demoralizes
and
overcomes
the
opponent
while
and
him
it
is
relevant
to
remember
that
men
commonly
regard
some
causes
as
more
important
than
their
lives
and
to
them
it
will
seem
insignificant
that
it
is
proposed
to
defeat
such
causes
technique
by
which
it
is
proposed
to
enter
with
compulsion
into
the
very
heart
of
a
man
and
determine
his
values
may
often
in
fact
seem
the
more
unlimited
aggression
groups
the
have
commonly
been
aware
more
than
others
of
the
fact
that
the
nature
of
divine
charity
raises
decisively
the
question
of
the
use
of
all
forms
of
pressure
the
will
and
word
of
are
for
them
concentrated
in
love
it
seems
clear
to
them
that
resistance
is
quite
another
thing
primary
objective
of
writes
the
outstanding
ethicist
is
not
peace
or
obedience
to
the
divine
will
but
rather
certain
desired
social
changes
for
personal
or
class
or
national
advantage
agreeing
with
every
phrase
in
this
statement
we
must
certainly
assert
the
great
difference
between
love
and
any
form
of
resistance
and
then
go
on
beyond
the
position
and
affirm
that
must
first
justify
and
then
determine
the
moral
principles
limiting
resistance
principles
we
have
now
set
forth
in
the
use
of
power
needs
not
only
to
be
asserted
but
clearly
specified
and
when
this
is
done
it
will
be
found
that
the
principles
governing
resistance
cut
across
the
distinction
between
violent
and
means
and
apply
to
both
alike
justifying
either
on
occasion
and
always
limiting
either
action
in
the
use
of
power
means
more
than
inflicting
a
barely
intolerable
pressure
upon
an
opponent
and
upon
the
injustice
opposed
would
amount
to
calculating
the
means
and
justifying
them
wholly
in
terms
of
their
effectiveness
in
reaching
desired
goals
must
also
be
additional
and
more
fundamental
discrimination
in
the
use
of
means
of
resistance
violent
or
justification
in
conscience
of
the
use
of
any
mode
of
resistance
also
lays
down
its
limitation
in
the
distinction
between
the
persons
against
whom
pressure
is
primarily
directed
those
upon
whom
it
may
be
permitted
also
to
fall
and
those
who
may
never
be
directly
repressed
for
the
sake
even
of
achieving
some
great
good
these
terms
the
economic
withdrawal
of
the
of
from
trading
in
the
center
city
for
example
was
clearly
justified
since
these
distinctions
do
not
require
that
only
people
subjectively
guilty
be
singled
out
may
now
take
up
for
consideration
a
hard
case
which
seems
to
require
either
no
action
employing
economic
pressure
or
else
action
that
would
seem
to
violate
the
principles
set
forth
above
may
be
instances
in
which
if
economic
pressure
is
to
be
undertaken
at
all
this
would
have
to
be
applied
without
discrimination
against
a
whole
people
excellent
article
was
published
recently
in
the
by
a
journalist
on
the
inhuman
economic
conditions
of
the
blacks
in
amounting
to
virtual
slavery
and
the
economic
complicity
of
both
the
government
and
the
people

these
conditions

only
from
capital
investors

also
from
the
pockets
of
taxpayers
this
author
states
are
being
poured
into
to
support
a
system
dedicated
to
the
oppression
the
persecution
and
the
almost
diabolical
exploitation
of
million
people
the
color
of
whose
skins
happens
not
to
be
white
the
conditions
and
the
complicity
are
documented
in
considerable
detail
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fact
is
inescapable
that
does
have
a
say
in
whether
or
not
apartheid
shall
continue
leadership
in
a
wide
economic
boycott
of
would
be
not
only
in
accord
it
seems
with
the
moral
conscience
of
not
to
be
denied
because
we
also
as
a
people
have
widespread
injustice
in
the
relations
of
the
races
in
our
own
country
but
also
in
accord
with
our
law
which
forbids
the
importation
of
goods
made
by
forced
or
convict
labor
only
should
this
provision
be
enforced
but
other
economic
and
political
actions
might
be
taken
which
this
author
believes
must
surely
be
supported
by
every
who
values
the
freedom
that
has
been
won
for
him
and
whose
conscience
is
not
so
dominated
by
the
lines
in
his
account
books
that
he
can
willingly
and
knowingly
contribute
to
the
enslavement
of
another
nation

write
about
liberals
from
considerable
personal
experience
married
to
a
have
lived
for
many
years
in
a
commuting
town
with
a
high
percentage
of
artists
writers
publicity
men
and
business
executives
of
egghead
tastes
of
them
are
and
nearly
all
consider
themselves
and
are
viewed
as
liberals
is
puzzling
to
an
outsider
conscious
of
the
classic
tradition
of
liberalism
because
it
is
clear
that
these
who
are
are
at
opposite
poles
from
the
liberal
who
held
that
the
best
government
was
the
least
government
paradoxically
my
liberal
friends
continue
to
view
as
one
of
their
patron
saints
question
them
as
to
what
they
mean
by
concepts
like
liberty
and
democracy
find
that
they
fall
into
two
categories
the
simpler
ones
who
have
simply
accepted
the
shibboleths
of
their
faith
without
analysis
and
the
intelligent
cynical
ones
who
scornfully
reply
that
these
things
count
any
more
in
the
world
of
am
naive
they
say
to
make
use
of
such
words
take
this
to
mean
that
the
intelligent
and
therefore
necessarily
cynical
liberal
considers
that
the
need
for
a
national
economy
with
controls
that
will
assure
his
conception
of
social
justice
is
so
great
that
individual
and
local
liberties
as
well
as
democratic
processes
may
have
to
yield
before
it
seems
like
an
attitude
favoring
a
sort
of
totalitarian
bureaucracy
which
under
a
of
the
same
stamp
would
try
to
coerce
an
uncooperative
or
for
rights
they
have
never
counted
in
the
thinking
of
my
liberal
friends
except
as
irritations
of
a
minor
and
immoral
nature
which
exist
now
only
as
anachronisms
liberal
may
in
the
world
of
have
a
strong
case
but
he
presents
it
publicly
so
enmeshed
in
hypocrisy
that
it
is
not
an
honest
one
in
the
first
place
call
himself
a
liberal
if
he
is
against
and
favors
an
authoritarian
central
government
with
controls
over
everybody
he
attaches
little
importance
to
personal
liberty
why
not
make
this
known
to
the
world
if
he
is
so
scornful
of
the
rights
of
states
why
not
advocate
a
different
sort
of
constitution
that
he
could
more
sincerely
support
am
concerned
here
however
with
the
attitude
toward
the
appears
to
be
one
of
intense
dislike
which
he
makes
little
effort
to
conceal
even
in
the
presence
of
friends
assumption
seems
to
be
that
any
such
friends
being
tolerable
humans
must
be
more
liberal
than
most
and
therefore
at
least
partly
in
sympathy
with
his
views
editor
in
his
book
wrote
most
of
what
was
different
about
it
the
found
myself
unsympathetic
to
for
the
liberals
know
would
be
an
understatement
is
no
mere
lack
of
sympathy
but
something
closer
to
the
passionate
hatred
that
was
directed
against
do
not
think
that
my
experience
would
be
typical
for
living
in
the
business
circles
usually
conservative
this
sort
of
atmosphere
would
hardly
be
found
in
our
case
and
neither
my
wife
nor
have
extreme
views
on
integration
nor
are
we
given
to
emotional
outbursts
the
situation
has
ruined
one
or
two
valued
friendships
and
come
close
to
wrecking
several
more
fact
it
has
caused
us
to

the

his

of

these

my

other

this

to
be

strong
feeling

certainly
there

there
is
a
leavening

for
this
discussion
the
most
important
division
is
between
those
who
have
been
reconstructed
and
those

definition
of
this

that
a

one

many
there

along
after

attitudes
are

more
tenaciously
in

that
a

there
the

is
more
precious
and
the
consciousness
of

greater
we
should
not
even
discount
the
fact
that
a
region
such
as
the
coastal
lowlands

closer
ties
with

with

certain
respects

increased
the
persistent
of

been

humbled
where
they
had
been

no

any
hope
of

the
rebels
who
would
not

comfort
from
the
sympathy
they
felt

to
them
by
the
mother
country
no
doubt
many
people
in
states
like
the

which
were
among
the
most
in

in
the
eighteenth
century
bitterly
regretted
the
revolt
against

may
have
less
to
do
with
their
remaining
unreconstructed

other
factors
agree
that
slavery
had
to
go
but
many
historians
maintain
that
except
for
meddling
it
would
have
ended
in
states
like
years
before
it
did
resentment
has
been
over
the
method
of
its
ending
the
invasion
and
their
fears
now
are
of
miscegenation
and
political
control
in
many
counties
apart
from
racial
problems
the
old
unreconstructed
to
use
the
moderate
words
favored
by
finds
itself
unsympathetic
to
most
of
what
is
different
about
the
civilization
of
the
this
in
effect
means
most
of
modern
is
hard
to
see
how
the
situation
could
be
otherwise
therein
feel
many
delude
themselves
about
the
one
thing
this
is
not
a
subject
often
discussed
or
analyzed
seems
to
be
almost
a
conspiracy
of
silence
veiling
it
suppose
the
reason
is
a
kind
of
wishful
thinking
talk
about
the
final
stages
of
and
they
will
take
care
of
themselves
else
the
really
believes
that
all
except
a
few
quaint
old
characters
have
come
around
to
realizing
the
errors
of
their
past
and
are
now
at
heart
sharers
of
the
like
everybody
else
the
circumstances
are
faced
frankly
it
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
this
to
be
true
situation
of
the
since
has
been
unique
in
the
western
world
of
rights
and
wrongs
a
population
and
an
area
appropriate
to
a
great
power
have
been
following
conquest
ruled
against
their
will
by
a
neighboring
people
and
have
had
imposed
upon
them
social
and
economic
controls
they
dislike
the
great
majority
of
these
people
are
of
or
descent
is
the
only
case
in
modern
history
of
a
people
of
origin
submitting
without
continued
struggle
to
what
they
view
as
foreign
domination
fact
is
due
mainly
to
international
wars
both
hot
and
cold
every
war
of
the
since
the
the
was
more
belligerent
than
the
rest
of
the
country
instead
of
being
tests
of
the
loyalty
the
the
two
and
the
all
served
to
overcome
old
grievances
and
cement
reunion
there
is
no
section
of
the
nation
more
ardent
than
the
in
the
cold
war
against
the
situation
been
reversed
had
for
instance
been
the
enemy
in
because
of
issues
of
concern
chiefly
to
there
is
little
doubt
that
large
numbers
of
would
have
happily
put
on
their
old
uniforms
to
fight
as
allies
of
is
extraordinary
that
a
people
as
proud
and
warlike
as
should
have
been
as
docile
as
they
have
should
thank
its
stars
that
such
has
been
the
case
but
at
the
same
time
it
should
not
draw
false
inferences
therefrom
two
main
charges
levelled
against
the
by
liberals
is
that
they
are
racists
and
social
reactionaries
is
much
truth
in
both
these
charges
and
not
many
deny
them
their
faults
they
are
not
hypocrites
of
them
sincerely
believe
that
the
is
the
best
race
in
the
world
and
that
it
should
remain
pure
believe
this
too
but
few
of
them
will
say
so
publicly
economic
philosophy
moreover
is
not
very
different
from
that
of
conservatives
those
among
the
who
remain
unreconstructed
go
much
further
than
this
believe
that
if
the
had
been
let
alone
it
would
have
produced
a
civilization
superior
to
that
of
modern
it
is
they
consider
that
the
is
now
reaping
the
fruits
of
excess
egalitarianism
that
in
spite
of
its
high
standard
of
living
the
way
has
been
proved
inferior
to
the
and
ways
although
they
disapprove
of
the
socialistic
features
of
the
latter
antipathy
to
civilization
includes
such
charges
as
poor
manners
harsh
accents
lack
of
appreciation
of
the
arts
of
living
like
gastronomy
and
the
use
of
leisure
own
easier
slower
tempo
is
especially
dear
to
and
have
heard
many
say
that
they
are
content
to
earn
a
half
or
a
third
as
much
as
they
could
up
because
they
so
much
prefer
the
quieter
habits
of
their
home
town
the
past
the
duties
of
the
state
as
noted
long
ago
were
only
two
in
number
internal
order
and
external
security
prevailing
over
other
claimants
for
the
loyalties
of
men
the
maintained
an
adequate
measure
of
certainty
and
order
within
its
territorial
borders
those
limits
it
asserted
as
against
other
states
a
position
of
sovereign
equality
and
as
against
the
inferior
peoples
of
the
world
a
position
of
dominance
became
the
sole
subject
of
international
law
a
term
which
it
is
pertinent
to
remember
was
coined
by
a
body
of
legal
principle
which
by
and
large
was
made
up
of
what
nations
could
do
in
the
world
arena
corpus
of
law
was
a
reflection
of
the
power
system
in
existence
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
generally
it
furthered
and
still
tends
to
further
the
interests
of
the
powers
enormous
changes
in
world
politics
have
however
thrown
it
into
confusion
so
much
so
that
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
international
law
is
now
in
need
of
reexamination
and
clarification
in
light
of
the
social
conditions
of
the
present
era
the
two
basic
tasks
mentioned
above
no
attention
was
paid
by
statesman
or
scholar
to
an
idea
of
state
responsibility
either
internally
or
externally
was
particularly
true
in
the
world
arena
which
was
an
anarchical
battleground
characterized
by
strife
and
avaricious
competition
for
colonial
empires
any
sort
of
duty
was
owed
by
his
nation
to
other
nations
would
have
astonished
a
statesman
duty
was
to
his
sovereign
and
to
his
nation
and
an
extension
to
peoples
beyond
the
territorial
boundaries
was
not
to
be
contemplated
to
cite
but
one
example
the
of
the
nineteenth
century
whether
with
the
navy
ruling
the
seas
or
with
the
of
ruling
world
finance
was
strictly
national
in
motivation
however
much
other
nations
the
may
have
incidentally
benefited
the
same
time
all
suggestions
that
some
sort
of
societal
responsibility
existed
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
within
the
territorial
state
was
strongly
resisted
was
able
to
stave
off
the
incipient
socialist
movement
until
well
into
the
present
century
in
recent
decades
for
what
doubtless
are
multiple
reasons
an
unannounced
but
nonetheless
readily
observable
shift
has
occurred
in
both
facets
of
national
activity
concept
of
responsibility
is
in
process
of
articulation
and
establishment
firmly
implanted
internally
it
is
a
growing
factor
in
external
matters
little
more
than
twenty
years
ago
the
people
turned
an
important
corner
what
has
aptly
been
called
a
constitutional
revolution
the
basic
nature
of
government
was
transformed
from
one
essentially
negative
in
nature
the
state
to
one
with
affirmative
duties
to
perform
positive
state
came
into
existence
lawyers
reflecting
perhaps
their
parochial
preferences
there
has
been
a
special
fascination
since
then
in
the
role
played
by
the
in
that
transformation
the
manner
in
which
its
decisions
altered
in
the
switch
in
time
that
saved
nine
but
in
effect
victorious
plan
the
imprimatur
of
judicial
approval
that
was
finally
placed
upon
social
legislation
greater
importance
however
is
the
content
of
those
programs
which
have
had
and
are
having
enormous
consequences
for
the
people
relations
have
been
transformed
income
security
has
become
a
standardized
feature
of
political
platforms
and
all
the
many
facets
of
the
version
of
the
welfare
state
have
become
part
of
the
conventional
wisdom
national
consensus
of
near
unanimity
exists
that
these
governmental
efforts
are
desirable
as
well
as
necessary
in
the
victory
in
the
is
now
evidenced
by
political
campaigns
being
waged
not
on
whether
but
on
how
much
social
legislation
there
should
be
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
of
governmental
societal
responsibility
for
the
economic
of
the
people
is
surely
one
of
the
two
most
significant
watersheds
in
constitutional
history
other
of
course
was
the
the
conflict
which
a
century
ago
insured
national
unity
over
fragmentation
third
one
of
at
least
equal
and
perhaps
even
greater
importance
is
now
being
traversed
immersion
and
involvement
in
world
affairs
national
responsibility
now
a
truism
need
not
be
documented
it
may
be
helpful
to
cite
one
example
that
of
employment
for
as
will
be
shown
below
it
cuts
across
both
facets
of
the
new
concept
years
ago
while
the
nation
was
wallowing
in
economic
depression
the
prevailing
philosophy
of
government
was
to
stand
aside
and
allow
natural
forces
to
operate
and
cure
the
distress
guiding
principle
of
the
fell
to
the
siege
guns
of
the
less
than
a
score
of
years
later
enacted
the
of
by
which
the
national
government
assumed
the
responsibility
of
taking
action
to
insure
conditions
of
maximum
employment
the
economy
was
replaced
by
conscious
guidance
through
planning
the
economic
side
of
the
constitutional
revolution
the
first
important
legislative
victory
of
the
came
when
the
principle
of
national
responsibility
for
local
economic
distress
won
out
over
a
proposal
provision
was
made
for
payment
for
unemployment
relief
by
taxation
rather
than
by
a
levy
only
on
those
states
afflicted
with
manpower
surplus
people
have
indeed
come
a
long
way
in
the
brief
interval
between
and
national
responsibility
is
a
societal
response
to
the
impact
of
the
to
its
simplest
terms
it
is
an
assumption
of
a
collective
duty
to
compensate
for
the
inability
of
individuals
to
cope
with
the
rigors
of
the
era
responsibility
for
individual
welfare
is
a
concept
not
limited
to
the
or
even
to
the
nations
measure
of
its
widespread
acceptance
may
be
derived
from
a
statement
of
the
of
in
in
under
the
auspices
of
the
of
a
body
of
lawyers
from
the
free
world
the
redefined
and
expanded
the
traditional
of
to
include
affirmative
governmental
duties
is
noteworthy
that
the
majority
of
the
delegates
to
the
were
from
the
less
developed
former
colonial
nations
of
historically
a
principle
according
everyone
his
day
in
court
before
an
impartial
tribunal
was
broadened
substantively
by
making
it
a
responsibility
of
government
to
promote
individual
welfare
that
the
of
is
a
dynamic
concept
which
should
be
employed
not
only
to
safeguard
the
civil
and
political
rights
of
the
individual
in
a
free
society
the
asserted
that
it
also
included
the
responsibility
to
establish
social
economic
educational
and
cultural
conditions
under
which
his
legitimate
aspirations
and
dignity
may
be
realized
idea
of
national
responsibility
thus
has
become
a
common
feature
of
the
nations
of
the
world
better
or
for
worse
we
all
now
live
in
welfare
states
the
organizing
principle
of
which
is
collective
responsibility
for
individual
a
concept
analogous
to
the
principle
of
internal
responsibility
operates
in
a
external
relations
is
less
obvious
and
more
difficult
to
establish
hypothesis
ventured
here
is
that
it
does
and
that
evidence
is
accumulating
validating
that
proposition
content
is
not
the
same
however
rather
than
individual
security
it
is
the
security
and
continuing
existence
of
an
ideological
group
those
in
the
free
world
that
is
basic
national
responsibility
involves
a
burgeoning
requirement
that
the
leaders
of
the
nations
so
guide
their
decisions
as
to
further
the
viability
of
other
friendly
nations
internal
responsibility
suggests
acceptance
of
the
socialist
ideal
of
equality
then
external
responsibility
implies
adherence
to
principles
of
ideological
supranationalism
to
two
other
concepts
nationalism
and
sovereignty
may
help
to
reveal
the
contours
of
the
new
principle
its
beginnings
the
had
to
struggle
to
assert
itself
internally
against
feudal
groups
and
externally
against
the
power
and
influence
of
such
other
claimants
for
loyalty
as
the
breakup
of
the
and
the
downfall
of
feudalism
led
not
more
than
two
centuries
ago
to
the
surge
of
nationalism
the
of
the
coincides
roughly
with
the
separate
existence
of
the
as
an
independent
entity
it
is
perhaps
natural
for
to
think
of
the
nation
as
representative
of
the
highest
form
of
order
something
permanent
and
unchanging
concept
of
nationalism
is
the
political
principle
that
epitomizes
and
glorifies
the
territorial
state
as
the
characteristic
type
of
socal
structure
it
is
more
than
that
it
includes
the
emotional
ties
that
bind
men
to
their
homeland
and
the
complex
motivations
that
hold
a
large
group
of
people
together
as
a
unit
as
new
nations
rise
from
the
former
colonial
empires
nationalism
is
one
of
the
hurricane
forces
loose
in
the
world
febrile
in
intensity
the
principle
has
become
worldwide
in
application
unfortunately
at
the
very
time
that
nationalist
fervors
can
wreak
greatest
harm
however
the
concept
is
one
that
has
been
of
marked
benefit
to
the
people
of
the
civilizational
group
subduing
disparate
lesser
groups
the
nation
has
to
some
degree
at
least
broadened
the
capacity
for
individual
liberty
their
confines
moreover
technological
and
industrial
growth
has
proceeded
at
an
accelerated
pace
thus
increasing
the
cornucopia
from
which
material
wants
can
be
satisfied
the
pattern
is
uneven
some
having
gained
more
than
others
nationalism
has
in
fact
served
the
peoples
well
historical
nationalism
helped
the
peoples
of
the
remainder
of
the
world
and
whether
nationalism
in
the
former
colonial
areas
has
equally
beneficial
aspects
are
other
questions
is
one
of
the
ironic
quirks
of
history
that
the
viability
and
usefulness
of
nationalism
and
the
territorial
state
are
rapidly
dissipating
at
precisely
the
time
that
the
attained
its
highest
number
approximately
it
is
more
than
irony
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
nationalism
is
no
longer
a
tenable
concept
is
because
it
has
spread
throughout
the
planet
other
words
nationalism
worked
well
enough
when
it
had
limited
application
both
as
to
geography
and
as
to
population
it
becomes
a
perilous
anachronism
when
adopted
on
a
basis
the
political
principle
of
nationalism
is
the
legal
principle
of
sovereignty
former
receives
its
legitimacy
from
the
latter
side
by
side
together
they
helped
shore
up
the
sovereignty
has
roots
in
antiquity
in
its
present
usage
it
is
essentially
modern
writing
in
the
sixteenth
century
may
have
been
the
seminal
thinker
but
it
was
the
vastly
influential
who
set
out
the
main
lines
of
the
concept
as
now
understood
view
of
law
and
sovereignty
still
dominates
much
of
legal
and
political
thinking
him
law
is
the
command
of
the
sovereign
the
monarch
who
personifies
the
power
of
the
nation
while
sovereignty
is
the
power
to
make
law
to
prevail
over
internal
groups
and
to
be
free
from
the
commands
of
other
sovereigns
in
other
nations
fundamental
ideas
the
indivisibility
of
sovereignty
and
its
dual
aspects
still
remain
the
core
of
that
concept
of
ultimate
political
power
then
exemplifies
the
principle
of
nationalism
and
exercises
sovereignty
supreme
power
over
domestic
affairs
and
independence
from
outside
control
fact
however
both
principles
have
always
been
nebulous
and
loosely
defined
abstractions
are
always
difficult
to
pin
down
with
precision
is
particularly
true
of
sovereignty
when
it
is
applied
to
democratic
societies
in
which
popular
sovereignty
is
said
to
exist
and
in
federal
nations
in
which
the
jobs
of
government
are
split
nationalism
and
sovereignty
are
reputed
in
the
accepted
wisdom
to
describe
the
modern
world
there
a
different
reality
behind
the
facade
the
surface
hide
a
quite
different
picture
short
answer
to
those
questions
is
yes
concepts
are
undergoing
alteration
to
some
degree
they
are
being
supplanted
by
a
concept
of
national
responsibility
evidence
to
support
that
view
consider
the
following
illustrative
instances
thermonuclear
war
be
set
off
by
accident
steps
have
been
taken
to
guard
against
the
one
sort
of
mishap
that
could
trigger
the
destruction
of
continents
we
as
safe
as
we
should
be
from
such
a
disaster
anything
being
done
to
increase
our
margin
of
safety
the
danger
increase
or
decrease
have
just
asked
these
questions
in
the
in
the
in
offices
of
key
scientists
across
the
country
and
aboard
the
submarines
that
prowl
for
months
underwater
with
neat
rows
of
green
launch
tubes
which
contain
missiles
and
which
are
affectionately
known
as
asked
the
same
questions
inside
the
rooms
of
an
missile
base
in
where
officers
who
wear
sidearms
are
manning
the
commit
buttons
that
could
start
a
war
accidentally
or
by
design
and
in
the
command
centers
where
other
men
could
give
orders
to
push
such
buttons
the
men
in
the
bomber
cockpits
submarine
compartments
and
the
antiseptic
windowless
rooms
that
would
be
the
foxholes
of
impersonal
intercontinental
wars
the
questions
seem
farfetched
is
unceasing
pressure
but
its
sources
are
immediate
exercises
are
almost
continuous
could
be
the
real
thing
the
command
centers
there
are
special
clocks
ready
to
tick
off
the
minutes
elapsed
since
hour
stands
for
execution
the
moment
a
go
order
would
unleash
an
nuclear
strike
is
little
time
for
the
men
in
the
command
centers
to
reflect
about
the
implications
of
these
clocks
are
preoccupied
riding
herd
on
control
panels
switches
flashing
colored
lights
on
pale
green
or
gray
consoles
that
look
like
business
machines
know
little
about
their
machinery
beyond
mechanical
details
war
is
so
sensitive
a
subject
that
most
of
the
people
who
could
become
directly
involved
in
one
are
told
just
enough
so
they
can
perform
their
portions
of
incredibly
complex
tasks
the
policy
makers
generals
physicists
psychologists
and
others
charged
with
controlling
the
actions
of
the
button
pushers
and
their
hardware
the
answers
to
my
questions
varied
partly
according
to
a
flair
for
what
the
professionals
in
this
field
call
scenarios
an
psychiatrist
put
it
have
dry
runs
on
this
one
experts
are
thus
forced
to
hypothesize
sequences
of
events
that
have
never
occurred
probably
never
will
but
possibly
might
one
rule
prevailed
in
my
conversations
with
these
men

highly
placed

are

more
they
know

the
urgency
of

and
nearly
all
other

of

recently
new
holes
were
discovered
in
our

a
search
is
now
on
for
more

hundreds

perhaps
you

the

their

about
the

they

that
the

would

more

was
nothing
more
than
a

a

it
obscured

no

fastened
upon
it
with
a
concentration
beyond
pathos
they
waited
until
the
squall
thickened
and
began
to
move
in
a
long
drifting
slant
across
the
dry
burning
land
once
the
whole
band
set
off
at

chasing
a

cloud
went
after
the
squall
as
mercilessly
as
a
wolf
pack
after
an
abandoned
cow
followed
them
in

and
now
they
did
not
care
games
were
over
this
was
life
for
no

that

they
would
suddenly
alter

it
was

the

had
changed

about

it

it

must
run

dangling
legs
barely
swinging
over

hung
down

occasionally
swinging
up
to
see
the

a
loose
motion
that
is
just
short
of
stumbling

yet
is
wonderfully
graceful
is
a
barely
controlled
skimming
of
the
ground
ran
for
three
hours
avoiding
hummocks
and
seeking
low
ground
they
intercepted
the
rain
squall
ten
minutes
they
ran
beneath
the
squall
raising
their
arms
and
for
the
first
time
shouting
and
capering
the
wind
died
and
the
rain
squall
held
steady
were
studying
the
ground
one
of
them
shouted
ran
a
few
feet
bent
forward

put
his
mouth
to

a
depression
with

water

it
bent
down
a
black
cranelike
figure
and
put
his
mouth
to

ground
a
lordly
and
generous
gesture
the
discoverer
stood
up
and
beckoned
to
the
closest
of
his
fellows

over

swooped
at
the
tiny

sucked
it
dry

not

it

many

left

deep
bare

fifty

sixty

thirty

forty

that
moves

an
inhuman
moonlike
quality

of

the

wanders

softened
by
the
saltbush

the
bluebush
has
a
peaceful
quality
the
hills
roll
softly
malignancy
of
such
a
landscape
has
been
beautifully
described
by
the

of
three
men
who
started
out

not

he

that

but
suspect
that
it
can
this
is
what
gives
the
aborigine
his
odd
air
of
dignity
family
at
the
boulder
seeing
an
aborigine
today
is
a
difficult
thing
of
them
have
drifted
into
the
cities
and
towns
and
seaports
are
confined
to
vast
reservations
and
not
only
does
the
government
justifiably
not
wish
them
to
be
viewed
as
exhibits
in
a
zoo
but
on
their
reservations
they
are
extremely
fugitive
shunning
camps
coming
together
only
for
corroborees
at
which
their
strange
culture
comes
to
its
highest
pitch
which
is
very
low
indeed
persuaded
an
friend
who
had
lived
outback
for
years
to
take
me
to
see
some
aborigines
living
in
the
bush
was
a
difficult
and
ambiguous
kind
of
negotiation
even
though
the
rancher
was
said
to
be
expert
in
his
knowledge
of
the
aborigines
and
their
language
however
the
arrangements
were
made
and
we
drove
out
into
the
bush
in
a
followed
the
asphalt
road
for
a
few
miles
and
then
swung
off
onto
a
smaller
road
which
was
nothing
more
than
two
tire
marks
on
the
earth
rancher
went
a
mile
down
this
road
and
then
when
he
reached
a
big
red
boulder
swung
off
the
road
once
he
started
to
glance
toward
the
instrument
panel
took
me
a
moment
to
realize
what
was
odd
about
that
panel
there
was
a
gimbaled
compass
welded
to
it
which
rocked
gently
back
and
forth
as
the
bounced
about
rancher
was
navigating
his
way
across
the
flatland
you
always
navigate
like
this
asked
right
he
said
get
out
on
the
flat
do
chaps
that
know
an
area
well
can
make
their
way
by
landmarks
a
tree
here
a
wash
here
a
boulder
there
if
you
know
the
place
like
the
palm
of
your
hand
better
use
a
compass
and
the
speedometer
miles
northeast
then
five
miles
southwest
that
sort
of
thing
simple
was
right
landscape
kept
repeating
itself
would
try
to
memorize
landmarks
and
saw
in
a
that
it
was
hopeless
we
approached
the
bivouac
of
the
aborigines
were
camped
beside
a
large
boulder
a
man
his
lubra
and
two
children
sun
was
not
yet
high
and
all
of
them
were
in
the
small
area
of
shade
cast
by
the
boulder
was
also
a
dog
a
dingo
dog
ribs
showed
it
was
a
yellow
nondescript
color
it
suffered
from
a
variety
of
sores
hair
had
scabbed
off
its
body
in
patches
lay
with
its
head
on
its
paws
and
only
its
eyes
moving
watching
us
carefully
struck
me
as
a
very
bright
and
very
malnourished
dog
one
patted
the
dog
was
not
a
pet
was
a
worker
buggers
love
shade
the
rancher
said
suppose
because
it
saves
them
some
loss
of
body
water
move
around
that
rock
all
day
following
the
shade
the
hottest
part
of
the
day
of
course
the
sun
comes
straight
down
and
there
any
shade
drove
close
to
the
boulder
stopped
the
and
walked
over
toward
the
family
man
was
leaning
against
the
rock
gazed
away
from
us
as
we
approached
was
over
six
feet
tall
and
very
thin
legs
were
narrow
and
very
long
bone
and
muscle
in
his
body
showed
but
he
did
not
give
the
appearance
of
starving
had
long
black
hair
and
a
wispy
beard
ridges
over
his
eyes
were
huge
and
his
eyelids
were
half
shut
was
something
about
his
face
that
disturbed
me
and
it
took
several
seconds
to
realize
what
was
not
merely
that
flies
were
crawling
over
his
face
but
his
narrowed
eyelids
did
not
blink
when
the
flies
crawled
into
his
eye
sockets
fly
would
crawl
down
the
bulging
forehead
into
the
socket
of
the
eye
walk
along
the
lashes
and
across
the
wet
surface
of
the
eyeball
and
the
eye
did
not
blink
and
both
were
wearing
insect
repellent
and
were
not
badly
bothered
by
insects
but
my
eyes
watered
as
we
stood
watching
the
aborigine
turned
to
look
at
the
lubra
remained
squatting
on
her
heels
all
the
time
we
were
there
like
the
man
she
was
entirely
naked
long
thin
arms
moved
in
a
slow
rhythmical
gesture
over
the
family
possessions
which
were
placed
in
front
of
her
were
two
rubbing
sticks
for
making
fire
two
stones
shaped
roughly
like
knives
a
container
which
held
a
few
pounds
of
dried
worms
and
the
dead
body
of
some
rodent
was
also
a
long
wooden
spear
and
a
woomera
a
device
which
gives
the
spear
an
enormous
velocity
and
high
accuracy
was
also
a
boomerang
elaborately
carved
was
burnished
with
sweat
and
grease
so
that
all
of
the
objects
seemed
to
have
been
carved
from
the
same
material
and
to
be
ageless
two
children
both
boys
wandered
around
the
and
me
for
a
few
moments
and
then
returned
to
their
work
squatted
on
their
heels
with
their
heads
bent
far
forward
their
eyes
only
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
had
located
the
runway
of
a
colony
of
ants
and
as
the
ants
came
out
of
the
ground
the
boys
picked
them
up
one
at
a
time
and
pinched
them
dead
tiny
bodies
dropped
onto
a
dry
leaf
made
a
pile
as
big
as
a
small
apple
odor
here
was
more
powerful
than
that
which
surrounded
the
town
aborigines
smell
at
first
was
more
surprising
than
unpleasant
was
also
subtly
familiar
for
it
was
the
odor
of
the
human
body
but
multiplied
innumerable
times
because
of
the
fact
that
the
aborigines
never
bathed
impulse
is
to
say
that
the
smell
was
a
stink
and
unpleasant
that
is
a
cliche
and
a
dishonest
one
smell
is
sexual
but
so
powerfully
so
that
a
civilized
nose
must
deny
it
skin
was
covered
with
a
thin
coating
of
sweat
and
dirt
which
had
almost
the
consistency
of
a
second
skin
roll
at
night
in
ashes
to
keep
warm
and
their
second
skin
has
a
light
dusty
cast
to
it
spots
such
as
the
elbows
and
knees
the
second
skin
is
worn
off
and
realized
the
aborigines
were
much
darker
than
they
appeared
as
if
the
coating
of
sweat
dirt
and
ashes
were
a
cosmetic
boys
had
beautiful
dark
eyes
and
unlike
their
father
they
brushed
constantly
at
the
flies
and
blinked
their
eyes
smell
is
something
eh
mate
asked
swear
that
every
person
smells
different
and
every
family
smells
different
from
every
other
the
corroborees
when
they
get
to
dancing
and
sweating
see
them
rubbing
up
against
a
man
supposed
to
have
a
specially
good
smell
here
and
he
nodded
at
the
man
is
said
to
have
great
odor
stink
is
all
the
same
to
me
but
really
think
they
can
make
one
another
out
blindfolded
you
fella
like
tabac
said
sharply
still
stared
over
our
shoulders
at
the
horizon
stopped
trying
to
talk
a
pidgin
could
understand
and
spoke
strange
words
from
deep
in
his
chest
was
a
fortunate
time
in
which
to
build
for
the
seventeenth
century
was
a
great
period
in
art
architects
the
tile
and
carpet
makers
the
potters
painters
calligraphers
and
metalsmiths
worked
through
reign
and
those
of
his
successors
to
enrich
the
city
entering
from
the
desert
were
confounded
by
what
must
have
seemed
an
illusion
a
great
garden
filled
with
nightingales
and
roses
cut
by
canals
and
terraced
promenades
studded
with
water
tanks
of
turquoise
tile
in
which
were
reflected
the
glistening
blue
curves
of
a
hundred
domes
the
heart
of
all
of
this
was
the
square
which
one
such
traveler
declared
to
be
as
spacious
as
pleasant
and
aromatick
a
as
any
in
the
time
came
to
be
known
as
half
the
world
the
early
eighteenth
century
this
fantastic
city
then
the
size
of
started
to
decline
invaded
the
fell
from
power
the
capital
went
elsewhere
the
desert
encroached
became
more
of
a
legend
than
a
place
and
now
it
is
for
many
people
simply
a
name
to
which
they
attach
their
notions
of
old
and
sometimes
of
the
think
of
it
as
a
kind
of
spooky
museum
in
which
they
may
half
see
and
half
imagine
the
old
splendor
who
actually
get
there
find
that
it
spooky
at
all
but
as
brilliant
as
a
tile
in
sunlight
even
for
them
it
remains
a
museum
or
perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
say
a
tomb
a
tomb
in
which
lies
well
preserved
but
indeed
dead
is
ready
to
grant
the
their
history
but
almost
no
one
is
willing
to
acknowledge
their
present
seems
that
for
and
especially
for
this
city
there
are
only
two
times
the
glorious
past
and
the
corrupt
depressing
sterile
present
one
apparent
connection
between
the
two
is
a
score
of
buildings
which
somehow
or
other
have
survived
and
which
naturally
enough
are
called
historical
monuments
just
as
all
the
buildings
have
not
fallen
and
flowed
back
to
their
original
mud
so
the
values
which
wanted
them
and
saw
that
they
were
built
have
not
all
disappeared
values
and
talents
which
made
the
tile
and
the
dome
the
rug
the
poem
and
the
miniature
continue
in
certain
social
institutions
which
rise
above
the
ordinary
life
of
this
city
as
the
great
buildings
rise
above
blank
walls
and
dirty
lanes
too
the
social
institutions
are
housed
in
these
pavilions
and
palaces
and
bridges
for
these
great
structures
are
not
simply
historical
monuments
they
are
the
places
where
live
promenade
for
example
continues
to
take
place
on
the
a
garden
of
plane
and
poplar
trees
that
now
serves
as
the
principal
street
takes
place
as
well
along
the
terraces
and
through
the
arcades
of
the
bridge
and
also
in
the
gardens
of
the
square
the
day
when
many
relax
with
poetry
talk
and
a
samovar
people
do
not
it
is
true
stream
into
a
pavilion
and
garden
built
by
in
the
seventeenth
century
but
they
do
retire
into
hundreds
of
pavilions
throughout
the
city
and
up
the
river
valley
which
are
smaller
more
humble
copies
of
the
former
of
course
religious
life
continues
to
center
in
the
more
famous
mosques
and
commercial
life
very
much
a
social
institution
in
the
bazaar
three
other
great
activities
of
the
the
bath
the
teahouse
and
the
zur
khaneh
the
latter
a
kind
of
club
in
which
a
leader
and
a
group
of
men
in
an
octagonal
pit
move
through
a
rite
of
calisthenics
dance
chanted
poetry
and
music
do
not
take
place
in
buildings
to
which
entrance
tickets
are
sold
but
some
of
them
occupy
splendid
examples
of
domestic
architecture
long
domed
rooms
with
daises
of
turquoise
tile
their
end
walls
cut
through
to
the
orchards
and
the
sky
by
open
arches
more
important
and
the
thing
which
the
casual
traveler
and
the
blind
sojourner
often
do
not
see
is
that
these
places
and
activities
are
often
the
settings
in
which
exercise
their
extraordinary
aesthetic
sensibilities
air
fruit
poetry
music
the
human
form
these
things
are
important
to
and
they
experience
them
with
an
intense
and
discriminating
awareness
should
like
by
the
way
to
make
it
clear
that
am
not
using
the
word
carelessly
mean
a
few
aesthetes
who
play
about
with
sensations
like
a
young
prince
in
a
miniature
dabbling
his
hand
in
a
pool
things
are
important
to
almost
all
and
perhaps
most
important
to
the
most
ordinary
men
crying
love
poems
in
an
orchard
on
any
night
are
as
often
as
not
the
lutihaw
mustachioed
toughs
who
spend
most
of
their
lives
in
and
out
of
the
local
prisons
brothels
and
teahouses
few
months
ago
it
was
a
fairly
typical
landlord
who
in
the
dead
of
night
lugged
me
up
a
mountainside
to
drink
from
a
spring
famous
in
the
neighborhood
for
its
clarity
and
flavor
long
ago
an
acquaintance
a
water
rat
of
a
lad
up
from
the
maw
of
the
city
stood
on
the
balcony
puffing
his
first
cigarette
in
weeks
air
he
said
was
just
right
a
cigarette
would
taste
particularly
good
really
know
what
he
meant
was
a
nice
day
granted
he
knew
he
sniffed
the
air
and
licked
it
on
his
lip
and
knew
as
a
vintner
knows
a
vintage
natural
world
then
plus
poetry
and
some
kinds
of
art
receives
from
the
most
ordinary
of
a
great
deal
of
attention
line
of
an
eyebrow
the
color
of
the
skin
a
ghazal
from
the
purity
of
spring
water
the
long
afternoon
among
the
boughs
which
crowd
the
upper
story
of
a
pavilion
these
things
are
noticed
judged
and
valued
in
is
this
rich
aesthetic
life
of
the
shown
so
well
as
during
the
promenade
at
the
bridge
has
probably
always
been
a
bridge
of
some
sort
at
the
southeastern
corner
of
the
city
one
thing
there
is
a
natural
belt
of
rock
across
the
river
bed
for
another
it
was
here
that
one
of
the
old
caravan
routes
came
in
was
to
provide
a
safe
and
spacious
crossing
for
these
caravans
and
also
to
make
a
pleasance
for
the
city
that
in
about
built
of
brick
tile
and
stone
the
present
bridge
is
a
splendid
structure
upstream
it
looks
like
a
long
arcaded
box
laid
across
the
river
from
downstream
where
the
water
level
is
much
lower
it
is
a
high
elaborately
facaded
pavilion
top
story
contains
more
than
thirty
alcoves
separated
from
each
other
by
spandrels
of
blue
and
yellow
tile
either
end
and
in
the
center
there
are
bays
which
contain
nine
greater
alcoves
as
frescoed
and
capacious
as
church
apses
in
the
old
days
when
they
had
come
to
see
the
moon
or
displays
of
fireworks
sat
the
king
and
his
court
while
priests
soldiers
and
other
members
of
the
party
lounged
in
the
smaller
alcoves
between
twenty
vaults
tunnel
through
the
understructure
of
the
bridge
are
traversed
by
another
line
of
vaults
and
thus
rooms
arched
on
all
four
sides
are
formed
through
the
axis
of
the
bridge
there
is
a
long
diminishing
vista
like
a
visual
echo
of
piers
and
arches
while
the
vaults
fronting
upstream
and
down
frame
the
sunset
and
sunrise
the
mountains
and
river
pools
on
the
hottest
day
it
is

in
the

bottom
of
the

the
downstream

side
these
vaults
give
out
onto
terraces
twice
as
wide
as
the

itself
the
terraces
eighteen
in
all
broad
flights
of
steps
descend
into
the
water
or
onto
still
more
terraces
barely
above
the
level
of

they
have
made
far
more
than
just
a

and
summer
evenings
people
leave
their
shops
and
houses
and
walk
up
through
the
lanes
of
the
city
to
the

is
a
great
spectacle

itself
rises
up
from
the

enormous
like

set
for
an
epic
opera
press
along
the
terraces
down
the

relatively
quiet
corner
in

his

taught
him

play

he
was
able
to
read

even
devised

the

started

begins
with

and
which

rarely

and
he
refers

recalled
that
in
after
a
critic
had
attacked
him
for
still
trying
to
sell
to
the
the
response
at
the
next
concert
was
a
standing
ovation
that
is
virtually
in
retirement

my
dear

no
longer
with

probably
the
only
one
with
the
possible
exception
of
who
has
this
special
affinity
for
and
champions
the
works
of
and
he
introduces
so
much
modern
music
could
not
resist
asking
how
he
felt
about
it

always

at
all
times

entitled
to
have
an
opinion
consider
it
to
be
my
job
to
expose
the
public
to
what
is
being
written
today
all
his
musical
activities
did
he
have
the
time
and
inclination
to
do
anything
else
had
just
paid
a
brief
visit
to
the
to
admire
his
favorite
paintings
by

was
not
enthusiastic
over
the
newly
acquired
but
reminisced
with
pleasure
over
a
exhibit
he
had
been
able
to
see
in
a
year
ago
how
did
he
feel
about
modern
art
was
cautious
and
replied
with
a
smile
that
he
was
not
exposed
to
it
enough
to
hazard
comments
my
wife
puts
it
he
said
again
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
all
you
know
is
your
music
after
all
you
never
learned
anything
else
did

for
relaxation
his
late
colleague
he
reads
mystery
stories
in

his
prime
interest
apart
from

he
insisted
seriously
was
his

was
excited
about

my

added
to
my
opening
statement
a
sentence
in
which
claimed
that
youth
seemed
to
lack
the
enthusiasm
which
is
a
necessary
ingredient
of
anger

might
be
classified
as

bored
rather
than
angry

far
from
convinced

the
truth
of
my
statement
but
could
not
think
of
anything
that
might
evoke
responses
more
quickly

countered
a

like

that

my
attack
must
have
some
security
said
a
young
clerk
mentioned
that
for
my
first
long
voyage
did
not
even
have
the
money
for
the
return
fare
but
had
trusted
to
luck
that
would
earn

sufficient
amount

what

obviously

us
to
act
the

it

foolhardy
to

that

had
to
ask
friends

even
strangers
for

that
to
be

foreign
country

sufficient
funds

not
contribute

no
additional
controversy
and
soon
could
ask
each

what
he
expected
from

his

they
feared
most

for

no

offered
to
make
any

in

that

upsurge

none

an
addiction

example
of
the
changes
which

crept
over

be
seen
in
the
quest
for
a
position

a
problem
that
has
been
reflected
in
regional
fiction

since
the

discover

indicates
that
the
racial
aspect
of
the
dilemma
changed
radically

to

new
context

the
fact
that
only

of
gradual

an

anarchical

clear
that

picturing

who
mutters
yassuhs
and

with
blissful
deference

this
stereotype
is
doomed

become
in

as
obsolete
as

be
many
scattered

such
men
appear
to
be
a
vanishing
breed
openly
admit
that
the
is
easier
to
write
than
the

man
but
they
obviously
mean
by
this
not
a
personality
but
a
type
an
individualized
character
it
would
seem
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
assignments
a
writer
could
tackle
and
the
success
of
such
an
endeavor
is
as
suggested
above
glaringly
rare
as
the
situation
points
up
the

abrupt

affecting

it
also
points
up
the
of
urbanism
in
literature
book
concerned
with
the
role
in
an
urban
society
is
rare
indeed
recently
only
novel
has
openly
faced
the
problem
but
the
most
rabid
of
flag
wavers
admit
that
the
tradition
is
defunct
in
actuality
and
sigh
that
its
passing
was
accompanied
by
the
disappearance
of
many
genteel
and
aristocratic
traditions
of
the
reputedly
languid
way
of
life
earlier
writers
mourning
the
demise
of
the
old
order
tended
to
romanticize
and
exaggerate
this
gracious
imagery
creating
such
lasting
impressions
as
writers
who
are
supposed
to
keep
their
fingers
firmly
upon
the
pulse
of
their
subjects
insist
upon
drawing
out
this
legend
prolonging
its
burial
when
it
well
deserves
a
rest
after
the
overexploitation
of
the
past
century
these
writers
have
been
too
deeply
moved
by
this
romanticizing
but
they
can
hardly
deny
that
exaggerated
or
not
the
old
panorama
is
dead
says
in
his
article

an
already
too
minutely
autopsied

be
left
to
rest
in

and
let
us
fervently
hope
forever
done
with
further
bemoans
the
creation
of
an
unreal
image
of

which
is
too
readily
assimilated
by
both
foreign

suspicious

all
this

evidence

too
deeply
steeped
in
and
fumes
of
progress
are
in
his
nose
and
the
bright
steel
of
industry
towers
before
his
eyes
but
his
heart
is
away
in
with
razorback
hogs

night
riders
this
trip
to
the

above
all

to
sniff
the
effluvium
of
subhumanity
and
to
see
at

such
a

is
somewhat
akin
to
a
experience

masterfully

keenly

recalling
of

the
curse
of

erased

concern
even
here
is
with

slowly
changing
order
in

he
never
deals
with
such
specific
aspects
of
this

vast
and
overpowering
saga
of
the
gradual
changes

seep
into
the

eventually
tend
largely
to

wisely
that
the

gradually
evolved
out
of

consequently
its
agrarian
roots

he
presents
a
realm
of
source
material
which
may
well
serve
other

a

his
aim
rejects
all
subjectively
motivated

any
line
of

related

bases
his
approach
on
the
belief
that
anything
can
follow
anything

can
be
chanced
rather
than
chosen
and
this
approach
produces
an
experience
that
is
free
and

rather
than
bound
and

there
is
freshness
not

in

individual
movements

in

sequence

so
that

so
that
a

in
whether
to

only
touch
upon
it
now
much
as
have
long
wanted
to
write
a
book
about
it
think
it
is
essential
however
to
pinpoint
here
the
difference
between
the
two
concepts
of
sovereignty
that
went
to
war
in
if
only
to
see
better
how
imperative
is
our
need
today
to
clarify
completely
our
far
worse
confusion
on
this
subject
difference
came
down
to
this
insisted
that
the
was
in
last
analysis
what
its
name
implied
a
of
their
leaders
the
was
a
compact
made
by
the
people
of
sovereign
states
who
therefore
retained
the
right
to
secede
from
it
right
of
the
its
upholders
contended

essential
to
maintain
the
federal
balance
and
protect
the
liberty
of
the

from
the
danger
of
centralizing

in

champions
of
the
maintained
that
the
had
formed
fundamentally
the
united
people
of
that
it
was
a
compact
among
sovereign
citizens
rather
than
states
and
that
therefore
the
states
had
no
right
to
secede
though
the
citizens
could
to
on
made
the
latter
point
clear
homely
terms
whose
timeliness
is
startling
today
he
thus
declared
his
own
right

by
declaring
that
all

are

practically

all

it
will
read
men

foreigners
and
it
comes
to
this
shall
prefer
emigrating
to
some
country
where
they
make
no
pretence
of
loving
liberty
to
for

where
despotism
can
be
taken
pure
without
the
base
alloy
of

the
exercised
their
right
to

they
formed
what
they
officially
styled
of
as
we
have
seen
still
cite
this
government
along
with
the
of
of
as
an
example
of
a
confederacy
fact
is
that
the
differed
from
the
earlier
one
almost
as
much
as
the
did
copied
much
of
the
verbatim
and
most
of
the
rest
in
substance
operated
on

for
the

just
as

substantially
the

division
of

between
the
central

governments
and
among
the
executive

and
judicial
branches
difference
between
confederacy
and
federal
union
in
believe
and
understandably
that
the
great
difference
between
the
of
the
and
the
was
that
the
former
recognized
the
right
of
each
state
to
secede
though
each
of
its
members
had
asserted
this
right
against
the
the
final
which
the
signed
on
nearly
a
month
before
hostilities
began
included
no
explicit
provision
authorizing
a
state
to
secede
drafters
discussed
this
vital
point
but
left
it
out
of
their
interpreted
their
to
mean
that
it
admits
of
no
coerced
association
but
this
remained
so
doubtful
that
there
were
frequent
demands
that
the
right
to
secede
be
put
into
the
of
the
differed
from
that
of
the
only
in
two
important
respects
openly
defiantly
recognized
slavery
an
institution
which
the
of
even
though
they
continued
it
found
so
impossible
to
reconcile
with
freedom
that
they
carefully
avoided
mentioning
the
word
in
the
recognized
that
slavery
was
a
moral
issue
and
not
merely
an
economic
interest
and
that
to
recognize
it
explicitly
in
their
would
be
in
explosive
contradiction
to
the
concept
of
sovereignty
they
had
set
forth
in
the
of
that
all
men
are
created
equal
that
they
are
endowed
by
their
with
certain
unalienable
rights
that
among
them
are
life
liberty
and
the
pursuit
of
happiness
other
important
difference
between
the
two

that
the
of

for
six

of
four
years

limited

the
worst
war
of
the
century
was
fought
though
the
when
drafting
a
constitution
to
unite
themselves
narrowed
the
difference
to
this
fine
point
by
omitting
to
assert
the
right
to
secede
the
fact
remained
that
by
seceding
from
the
they
had
already
acted
on
the
concept
that
it
was
composed
primarily
of
sovereign

citizens
had
gained
by
their

that
the
act
of

made
the
issue
for
the
a
vital
one
it
was
a
of
sovereign
citizens
that
should
continue
to
live
or
an
association
of
sovereign
states
that
must
fall
prey
either
to
anarchy
or
despotism
as
he
abhorred
slavery
was
always
willing
to
concede
to
each
slave
state
the
right
to
decide
independently
whether
to
continue
or
end

was
interpreted
by
many
as
the
forerunner
of
a
dangerous
shift
in

federal

of

such

that

truth
on
each
side
won
in
the
civil
war
fact
that
the
who
upheld
the
sovereignty
of
their
states
did
this
in
order
to
keep
many
of
their
people
more
securely
in

the
antithesis
of
individual
liberty
made
the
conflict
grimmer
and
the
greater
of
this
ordeal
the

of

between

and

who

that

were
at

and
he
reached
the
height
of
saying
so
explicitly
in
his
my
knowledge

the
only
of
and
who
while
fighting
a
fearful
war
whose
issue
was
in
doubt
proved
man
enough
to
say
this
publicly
to
give
his
foe
the
benefit
of
the
fact
that
in
all
human
truth
there
is
some
error
and
in
all
our
error
some
truth
great
a
man
could
not
but
understand
too
that
the
thing
that
moves
men
to
sacrifice
their
lives
is
not
the
error
of
their
thought
which
their
opponents
see
and
attack
but
the
truth
which
the
latter
do
not
see
any
more
than
they
see
the
error
which
mars
the
truth
they
themselves
defend
is
much
less
difficult
now
than
in
day
to
see
that
on
both
sides
sovereign
had
given
their
lives
in
the
to
maintain
the
balance
between
the
powers
they
had
delegated
to
the
and
to
their
differed
in
the
balance
they
believed
essential
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
citizen
but
the
supreme
sacrifice
each
made
served
to
maintain
a
still
more
fundamental
truth
individual
life
liberty
and
happiness
depend
on
a
right
balance
between
the
two
and
on
the
limitation
of
sovereignty
in
all
its
aspects
which
this
involves
who
gave
the
last
full
measure
of
devotion
to
prevent
disunion
preserved
individual
freedom
in
the
from
the
dangers
of
anarchy
inherent
in
confederations
which
throughout
history
have
proved
fatal
in
the
end
to
all
associations
composed
primarily
of
sovereign
states
and
to
the
liberties
of
their
people
the
fact
that
other
gave
the
same
measure
of
devotion
to
an
opposing
concept
served
in
other
essential
ways

from
ballots
to
bullets

ended
by
costing
the
their
right
to
have
slaves
a
right
that
was
even
less
compatible
with
the
sovereignty
of
man
very
fact
that
they
came
so
near
to
winning
by
the
wrong
method
war
led
directly
to
their
losing
both
the
war
and
the
wrong
thing
they
fought
for
since
it
forced
to
free
their
slaves
as
a
military
measure
was
a
divine
justice
in
one
wrong
thus
undoing
another
was
also
a
lesson
one
that
has
served
ever
since
to
keep
in
their
conflicts
with
one
another
from
turning
from
the
ballot
to
the
bullet
though
the

worst

in
their
case
they
did
not
lose
the
truth
they
fought
for
lives
so
many
of
them

to
forestall
what
they
believed
would
be
a
fatal
encroachment

they
built
new
unnatural
and
internally
controlled

to
cope
even
more
successfully
with
the
properties
of
the
external
world
useful
suggestion
of
which
considers
culture
as
a
third
stage
in
biological
evolution
fits
quite
beautifully
then
with
our
suggestion
that
science
has
provided
us
with
a
rather
successful
technique
for
building
protective
artificial
environments
wonders
about
its
applicability
to
people
advances
in
human
sciences
help
us
build
social
structures
and
governments
which
will
enable
us
to
cope
with
people
as
effectively
as
the
primitive
combination
of
protein
and
nucleic
acid

a
structure
of
molecules
which
enabled
it
to
adapt
to
a
sea
of
molecular
interaction
answer
is
of
course
yes
the
family
is
the
simplest
example
of
just
such

unit
composed
of
people
which
gives
us
both
some
immunity
from
and
a
way

dealing

did
not
have
to
await
social
theory
any
more
than
use
of
the
warmth
of
a
fire

to
await
or
the
buoyant
protection
of
a
boat
the
formulations
of
it
has
been
during
the
last
two
centuries
during
the
scientific
revolution
that
our
independence
from

has
made
the
most
rapid
strides

ample
light
when
the

fly
through

although

pulls
us
down
the

of
our

what
stage
are
social
sciences
then
the
future
of
psychology
akin
to
the
rich
future
of
physics
at
the
time
of
is
a
haunting
resemblance
between
the
notion
of

in
and
in
it
is
certainly
no
slight
to
either
of
them
to
compare
both
their
achievements
and
their
impact
theoretical
understanding
although
almost
at
a
standstill
during
this
century
did
develop
during
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
and
resulted
in
a
flood
of
inventions
which
increased
the
possibility
for
man
to
coexist
with
man
government
popular

by

public
education
labor

communes
socialized
ownership
world

and
the

power
in

councils
are
but
a
few
examples
of
these
with
horrible
exceptions
were
conceived
as
is
a
ship
not
as
an
attempt
to
quell
the
ocean
of
mankind
nor
to
deny
its
force
but
as
a
means
to
survive
and
enjoy
it
most
effective
political
inventions
seem
to
make
maximum
use
of
natural
harbors
and
are
aware
that
restraining
breakwaters
can
play
only
a
minor
part
in
the
whole
scheme
as
present
technology
had
to
await
the
explanations
of
physics
so
one
might
expect
that
social
invention
will
follow

sociological
understanding
are
desperately
in
the
need
of
such
invention
for
man
is
still
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
man
fact
the
accumulation
of
the
hardware
of
destruction
is
day
by
day
increasing
our
fear
of
each
other
want
therefore
to
discuss
a
second
and
quite
different
fruit
of
science
the
connection
between
scientific
understanding
and
fear
are
certainly
large
areas
of
understanding
in
the
human
sciences
which
in
themselves
and
even
without
political
invention
can
help
to
dispel
our
present
fears
has
remarked
reason
why
all
are
so
gripped
by
fear
is
that
they
see
all
sorts
of
things
happening
in
the
earth
and
sky
with
no
discernable
cause
and
these
they
attribute
to
the
will
of
things
were
even
worse
then
is
difficult
to
reconstruct
the
primeval
fears
of
man
get
some
clue
from
a
few
remembrances
of
childhood
and
from
the
circumstance
that
we
are
probably
not
much
more
afraid
of
people
now
than
man
ever
was
are
not
now
afraid
of
atomic
bombs
in
the
same
way
that
people
once
feared
comets
bombs
are
as
harmless
as
an
automobile
in
a
garage
are
worried
about
what
people
may
do
with
them
that
some
crazy
fool
may
push
the
button
am
certainly
not
adequately
trained
to
describe
or
enlarge
on
human
fears
but
there
are
certain
features
of
the
fears
dispelled
by
scientific
explanations
that
stand
out
quite
clearly
are
in
general
those
fears
that
once
seemed
to
have
been
amenable
to
prayer
or
ritual
include
both
individual
fears
and
collective
ones
arise
in
situations
in
which
one
believes
that
what
happens
depends
not
only
on
the
external
world
but
also
on
the
precise
pattern
of
behavior
of
the
individual
or
group
it
is
recognized
that
all
the
details
of
the
pattern
may
not
be
essential
to
the
outcome
but
because
the
pattern
was
empirically
determined
and
not
developed
through
theoretical
understanding
one
is
never
quite
certain
which
behavior
elements
are
effective
and
the
whole
pattern
becomes
ritualized
often
fear
persists
because
even
with
the
most
rigid
ritual
one
is
never
quite
free
from
the
uneasy
feeling
that
one
might
make
some
mistake
or
that
in
every
previous
execution
one
had
been
unaware
of
the
really
decisive
act
say
that
science
had
reduced
many
such
fears
merely
reiterates
the
obvious
and
frequent
statement
that
science
eliminated
much
of
magic
and
superstition
a
somewhat
more
detailed
analysis
of
this
process
may
be
illuminating
frequently
postulated
antique
worry
that
the
daylight
hours
might
dwindle
to
complete
darkness
apparently
gave
rise
to
a
ritual
and
celebration
which
we
still
recognize
is
curious
that
even
centuries
of
repetition
of
the
yearly
cycle
did
not
induce
a
sufficient
degree
of
confidence
to
allow
people
to
abandon
the
ceremonies
of
the
winter
solstice
and
other
fears
of
the
solar
system
have
disappeared
gradually
first
with
the
system
and
its
concept
of
periodicity
and
then
more
firmly
with
the
innovation
of
an
universal
force
that
could
account
quantitatively
for
both
terrestial
and
celestial
motions
understanding
provides
a
very
simple
example
of
the
fact
that
one
can
eliminate
fear
without
instituting
any
controls
fact
although
we
have
dispelled
the
fear
we
have
not
necessarily
assured
ourselves
that
there
are
no
dangers
is
still
the
remote
possibility
of
planetoid
collision
meteor
could
fall
on
activities
could
presumably
bring
long
periods
of
flood
or
drought
understanding
of
the
solar
system
has
taught
us
to
replace
our
former
elaborate
rituals
with
the
appropriate
action
which
in
this
case
amounts
to
doing
nothing
we
no
longer
feel
uneasy
almost
trivial
example
is
nevertheless
suggestive
for
there
are
some
elements
in
common
between
the
antique
fear
that
the
days
would
get
shorter
and
shorter
and
our
present
fear
of
war
in
our
country
think
of
war
as
an
external
threat
which
if
it
occurs
will
not
be
primarily
of
our
own
doing
yet
we
obviously
also
believe
that
the
avoidance
of
the
disaster
depends
in
some
obscure
or
at
least
uncertain
way
on
the
details
of
how
we
behave
elements
of
our
behavior
are
decisive
weapons
production
our
world
prestige
our
ideas
of
democracy
our
actions
of
trust
or
stubbornness
or
secrecy
or
espionage
have
staved
off
a
war
and
since
our
behavior
has
involved
all
these
elements
we
can
only
keep
adding
to
our
ritual
without
daring
to
abandon
any
part
of
it
since
we
have
not
the
slightest
notion
which
parts
are
effective
think
that
we
are
here
also
talking
of
the
kind
of
fear
that
a
young
boy
has
for
a
group
of
boys
who
are
approaching
at
night
along
the
streets
of
a
large
city
an
automobile
were
approaching
him
he
would
know
what
was
required
of
him
even
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
act
quickly
enough
the
group
of
boys
it
is
different
does
not
know
whether
to
look
up
or
look
aside
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
or
to
clench
them
at
his
side
to
cross
the
street
or
to
continue
on
the
same
side
confronted
with
a
drunk
or
an
insane
person
have
no
notion
of
what
any
one
of
them
might
do
to
me
or
to
himself
or
to
others
believe
that
what
do
has
some
effect
on
his
actions
and
have
learned
in
a
way
to
commune
with
drunks
but
certainly
my
actions
seem
to
resemble
more
nearly
the
performance
of
a
rain
dance
than
the
carrying
out
of
an
experiment
in
physics
am
usually
filled
with
an
uneasiness
that
through
some
unwitting
slip
all
hell
may
break
loose
inability
to
explain
why
certain
people
are
fond
of
us
frequently
induces
the
same
kind
of
ritual
and
malaise
are
forced
in
our
behavior
towards
others
to
adopt
empirically
successful
patterns
in
toto
because
we
have
such
a
minimal
understanding
of
their
essential
elements
collective
policies
group
and
national
are
similarly
based
on
voodoo
but
here
we
often
lack
even
the
empirically
successful
rituals
and
are
still
engaged
in
determing
them
use
terms
from
our
personal
experience
with
individuals
such
as
trust
cheat
and
get
tough
talk
about
national
character
in
the
same
way
that
talked
of
the
compulsions
of
celestial
bodies
to
move
in
circles
perform
elaborate
international
exhortations
and
ceremonies
with
virtually
no
understanding
of
social
cause
and
effect
wonder
then
that
we
fear
achievements
which
dispelled
our
fears
of
the
cosmos
took
place
three
centuries
ago
additional
roles
has
the
scientific
understanding
of
the
and
centuries
played
the
physical
sciences
these
achievements
concern
electricity
chemistry
and
atomic
physics
the
life
sciences
there
has
been
an
enormous
increase
in
our
understanding
of
disease
in
the
mechanisms
of
heredity
and
in
and
physiological
chemistry
major
effect
of
these
advances
appears
to
lie
in
the
part
they
have
played
in
the
industrial
revolution
and
in
the
tools
which
scientific
understanding
has
given
us
to
build
and
manipulate
a
more
protective
environment
addition
our
way
of
dealing
directly
with
natural
phenomena
has
also
changed
in
domains
where
detailed
and
predictive
understanding
is
still
lacking
but
where
some
explanations
are
possible
as
with
lightning
and
weather
and
earthquakes
the
appropriate
kind
of
human
action
has
been
more
adequately
indicated
the
population
as
a
whole
eventually
acquires
enough
confidence
in
the
explanations
of
the
scientists
to
modify
its
procedures
and
its
fears
and
why
this
process
occurs
would
provide
an
interesting
separate
subject
for
study
some
areas
the
progress
is
slower
than
in
others
agriculture
for
example
despite
the
advances
in
biology
elaborate
rituals
tend
to
persist
along
with
a
continued
sense
of
the
imminence
of
some
natural
disaster
child
care
the
opposite
extreme
prevails
procedures
change
rapidly
and
parental
confidence
probably
exceeds
anything
warranted
by
established
psychological
theory
are
many
domains
in
which
understanding
has
brought
about
widespread
and
quite
appropriate
reduction
in
ritual
and
fear
of
the
former
extreme
uneasiness
associated
with
visions
and
hallucinations
and
with
death
has
disappeared
persistent
horror
of
having
a
malformed
child
has
believe
been
reduced
not
because
we
have
gained
any
control
over
this
misfortune
but
precisely
because
we
have
learned
that
we
have
so
little
control
over
it
fact
the
recent
warnings
about
the
use
of
have
introduced
fears
and
ambiguities
of
action
which
now
require
more
detailed
understanding
and
thus
in
this
instance
science
has
momentarily
aggravated
our
fears
fact
insofar
as
science
generates
any
fear
it
stems
not
so
much
from
scientific
prowess
and
gadgets
but
from
the
fact
that
new
unanswered
questions
arise
which
until
they
are
understood
create
uncertainty
the
most
illuminating
example
of
the
reduction
of
fear
through
understanding
is
derived
from
our
increased
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
disease
situation
with
regard
to
our
attitude
and
control
of
disease
contains
close
analogies
to
problems
confronting
us
with
respect
to
people
fear
of
disease
was
formerly
very
much
the
kind
of
fear
have
tried
to
describe
like
he
arrived
before
the
hour
letter
had
suggested
we
meet
at
my
hotel
at
noon
on
and
came
into
the
lobby
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
was
waiting
wish
to
meet
had
been
prompted
by
simple
curiosity
and
interest
in
his
work
newspaper
reviewers
like
to
call
his
plays
nihilistic
find
deep
pessimism
in
them
so
astute
a
commentator
as
of
has
said
that
is
the
concentrate
of
the
contemporary
mood
of
despair
to
me
writing
had
seemed
permeated
with
love
for
human
beings
and
with
a
kind
of
humor
that
could
reconcile
neither
with
despair
nor
with
nihilism
it
be
that
my
own
eyes
and
ears
had
deceived
me
his
a
literature
of
defeat
irrelevant
to
the
social
crises
we
face
is
it
relevant
because
it
teaches
us
something
useful
to
know
about
ourselves
knew
that
a
conversation
with
the
author
would
not
settle
such
questions
because
a
man
is
not
the
same
as
his
writing
in
the
last
analysis
the
questions
had
to
be
settled
by
the
work
itself
was
curious
curiosity
was
sharpened
a
day
or
two
before
the
interview
by
a
conversation
had
with
a
teacher
of
literature
a
father
at
a
conference
on
religious
drama
near
name
came
into
the
discussion
the
priest
grew
loud
and
told
me
that
hates
life
thought
is
at
least
one
thing
can
find
out
when
we
meet
appearance
is
features
of
his
face
are
distinct
but
not
fine
look
as
if
they
had
been
sculptured
with
an
unsharpened
chisel
hair
goes
straight
up
from
his
forehead
standing
so
high
that
the
top
falls
gently
over
as
if
to
show
that
it
really
is
hair
and
not
bristle
might
say
it
combines
the
man
own
pride
and
humility
he
has
the
pride
that
comes
of
and
the
humility
perhaps
of
the
same
genesis
not
to
impose
himself
upon
another
light
blue
eyes
set
deep
within
the
face
are
actively
and
continually
looking
seems
by
some
unconscious
division
of
labor
to
have
given
them
that
one
function
and
no
other
leaving
communication
to
the
rest
of
the
face
mouth
frequently
breaks
into
a
disarming
smile
voice
is
light
in
timbre
with
a
rough
edge
that
corresponds
to
his
visage
accent
is
as
one
would
expect
combined
with
slight
inflections
from
the
tweed
suit
was
a
baggy
gray
and
green
wore
a
brown
knit
sports
shirt
with
no
tie
walked
down
the
thence
along
beside
the
and
across
to
a
sidewalk
cafe
opposite
that
church
conversation
that
ensued
may
have
been
engrossing
but
it
could
hardly
be
called
one
thing
the
world
that
sees
is
already
shattered
talk
turns
to
what
he
calls
the
mess
or
sometimes
this
buzzing
confusion
reconstruct
his
sentences
from
notes
made
immediately
after
our
conversation
appears
here
is
shorter
than
what
he
actually
said
but
very
close
to
his
own
words
confusion
is
not
my
invention
cannot
listen
to
a
conversation
for
five
minutes
without
being
acutely
aware
of
the
confusion
is
all
around
us
and
our
only
chance
now
is
to
let
it
in
only
chance
of
renovation
is
to
open
our
eyes
and
see
the
mess
is
not
a
mess
you
can
make
sense
of
suggested
that
one
must
let
it
in
because
it
is
the
truth
but
did
not
take
to
the
word
truth
is
more
true
than
anything
else
swim
is
true
and
to
sink
is
true
is
not
more
true
than
the
other
cannot
speak
anymore
of
being
one
must
speak
only
of
the
mess
and
speak
of
a
contrast
between
being
and
existence
they
may
be
right
know
but
their
language
is
too
philosophical
for
me
am
not
a
philosopher
can
only
speak
of
what
is
in
front
of
him
and
that
now
is
simply
the
mess
he
began
to
speak
about
the
tension
in
art
between
the
mess
and
form
recently
art
has
withstood
the
pressure
of
chaotic
things
has
held
them
at
bay
realized
that
to
admit
them
was
to
jeopardize
form
could
the
mess
be
admitted
because
it
appears
to
be
the
very
opposite
of
form
and
therefore
destructive
of
the
very
thing
that
art
holds
itself
to
be
now
we
can
keep
it
out
no
longer
because
we
have
come
into
a
time
when
it
invades
our
experience
at
every
moment
is
there
and
it
must
be
allowed
in
granted
this
might
be
so
but
found
the
result
to
be
even
more
attention
to
form
than
was
the
case
previously
why
not
asked
could
chaos
be
admitted
to
chaos
not
that
be
the
end
of
thinking
and
the
end
of
art
we
look
at
recent
art
we
find
it
preoccupied
with
form
own
work
is
an
example
more
highly
formalized
than
and
would
be
hard
to
find
am
saying
does
not
mean
that
there
will
henceforth
be
no
form
in
art
only
means
that
there
will
be
new
form
and
that
this
form
will
be
of
such
a
type
that
it
admits
the
chaos
and
does
not
try
to
say
that
the
chaos
is
really
something
else
form
and
the
chaos
remain
separate
latter
is
not
reduced
to
the
former
is
why
the
form
itself
becomes
a
preoccupation
because
it
exists
as
a
problem
separate
from
the
material
it
accommodates
find
a
form
that
accommodates
the
mess
that
is
the
task
of
the
artist
now
responded
could
not
similar
things
be
said
about
the
art
of
the
past
it
not
characteristic
of
the
greatest
art
that
it
confronts
us
with
something
we
cannot
clarify
demanding
that
the
viewer
respond
to
it
in
his
own
way
is
the
history
of
criticism
but
the
history
of
men
attempting
to
make
sense
of
the
manifold
elements
in
art
that
will
not
allow
themselves
to
be
reduced
to
a
single
philosophy
or
a
single
aesthetic
theory
all
art
ambiguous
this
he
said
and
gestured
toward
the
classical
lines
of
the
church
which
thought
of
as
a
of
dominated
all
the
scene
where
we
sat
the
and
the
ran
to
it
with
graceful
flattery
bearing
tidings
of
the
of
this
is
clear
does
not
allow
the
mystery
to
invade
us
classical
art
all
is
settled
it
is
different
at
is
the
unexplainable
and
there
art
raises
questions
that
it
does
not
attempt
to
answer
asked
about
the
battle
between
life
and
death
in
his
plays
and
hover
on
the
edge
of
suicide
world
is
death
and
may
or
may
not
get
out
of
it
to
join
the
living
child
outside
this
question
a
part
of
the
chaos
life
and
death
did
not
both
present
themselves
to
us
there
would
be
no
inscrutability
there
were
only
darkness
all
would
be
clear
is
because
there
is
not
only
darkness
but
also
light
that
our
situation
becomes
inexplicable
doctrine
of
grace
given
and
grace
withheld
have
you
pondered
the
dramatic
qualities
in
this
theology
thieves
are
crucified
with
one
saved
and
the
other
damned
can
we
make
sense
of
this
division
classical
drama
such
problems
do
not
arise
destiny
of
is
sealed
from
the
beginning
she
will
proceed
into
the
dark
she
goes
she
herself
will
be
illuminated
the
beginning
of
the
play
she
has
partial
illumination
and
at
the
end
she
has
complete
illumination
but
there
has
been
no
question
but
that
she
moves
toward
the
dark
is
the
play
this
notion
clarity
is
possible
but
for
us
who
are
neither
nor
there
is
not
such
clarity
question
would
also
be
removed
if
we
believed
in
the
contrary
total
salvation
where
we
have
both
dark
and
light
we
have
also
the
inexplicable
key
word
in
my
plays
is
perhaps
a
theological
lead
asked
what
he
thinks
about
those
who
find
a
religious
significance
to
his
plays
really
there
is
none
at
all
have
no
religious
feeling
had
a
religious
emotion
was
at
my
first
more
mother
was
deeply
religious
was
my
brother
knelt
down
at
his
bed
as
long
as
he
could
kneel
father
had
none
family
was
but
for
me
it
was
only
irksome
and
let
it
go
brother
and
mother
got
no
value
from
their
religion
when
they
died
the
moment
of
crisis
it
had
no
more
depth
than
an
old
school
tie
is
not
attractive
but
it
is
deeper
you
pass
a
church
on
an
bus
all
the
hands
flurry
in
the
sign
of
the
cross
day
the
dogs
of
will
do
that
too
and
perhaps
also
the
pigs
do
the
plays
deal
with
the
same
facets
of
experience
religion
must
also
deal
with
for
they
deal
with
distress
people
object
to
this
in
my
writing
a
party
an
intellectual
asked
me
why
write
always
about
distress
if
it
were
perverse
to
do
so
wanted
to
know
if
my
father
had
beaten
me
or
my
mother
had
run
away
from
home
to
give
me
an
unhappy
childhood
told
him
no
that
had
had
a
very
happy
childhood
he
thought
me
more
perverse
than
ever
left
the
party
as
soon
as
possible
and
got
into
a
taxi
the
glass
partition
between
me
and
the
driver
were
three
signs
one
asked
for
help
for
the
blind
another
help
for
orphans
and
the
third
for
relief
for
the
war
refugees
does
not
have
to
look
for
distress
is
screaming
at
you
even
in
the
taxis
of
was
over
and
we
walked
back
to
the
hotel
with
the
light
and
dark
of
screaming
at
us
personal
quality
of
is
similar
to
qualities
had
found
in
the
plays
says
nothing
that
compresses
experience
within
a
closed
pattern
stands
in
place
of
commitment
the
same
time
he
is
plainly
sympathetic
clearly
friendly
there
were
only
the
mess
all
would
be
clear
but
there
is
also
compassion
a
know
do
not
stand
where
stands
but
do
see
much
of
what
he
sees
a
writer
on
the
theater
have
paid
close
attention
to
the
plays
is
right
to
say
that
is
a
reflection
he
calls
it
a
distorted
reflection
of
the
impasse
and
disarray
of
present
politics
ethic
and
common
way
of
life
it
is
not
only
the
play
refers
to
sells
even
better
in
than
in
consciousness
it
mirrors
may
have
come
earlier
to
than
to
but
it
is
the
consciousness
that
most
mature
societies
arrive
at
when
their
successes
in
technological
and
economic
systematization
propel
them
into
a
time
of
examining
the
ends
of
culture
is
now
joining
in
this
mature
phase
of
development
any
of
us
remain
in
it
long
will
depend
on
what
happens
as
a
result
of
the
technological
and
economic
revolutions
now
going
on
in
the
countries
of
and
and
also
of
course
on
how
long
the
cold
war
remains
cold
for
all
his
efforts
to
formulate
a
naturalistic
morality
in
and
never
maintained
that
sex
was
all
fiction
is
supported
by
a
moral
backbone
and
in
its
search
for
ultimate
meaning
hints
at
a
religious
dimension
in
protested
vehemently
against
the
overestimation
of
the
sexual
motive
sex
in
some
form
or
other
enters
into
all
human
activity
and
it
was
a
good
thing
that
emphasized
this
aspect
of
human
nature
it
is
fantastic
to
explain
everything
in
terms
of
sex
is
not
sex
declared
is
not
confined
to
one
outlet
for
his
vital
energy
creative
urge
for
example
transcends
the
body
and
the
self
for
the
beat
generation
all
is
sex
is
more
revealing
of
the
way
of
life
and
literary
aspirations
of
this
group
than
their
attitude
toward
sex
the
beatnik
like
the
hipster
is
in
opposition
to
a
society
that
is
based
on
the
repression
of
the
sex
instinct
has
elevated
sex
not
or
libido
but
pure
spontaneous
uninhibited
sex
to
the
rank
of
the
godhead
it
is
the
mysterious
and
divine
orgone
energy
flowing
through
the
body
of
the
universe
is
sex
marijuana
is
a
stimulus
to
sex
the
beat
tempo
is
adjusted
to
the
orgiastic
release
of
the
sexual
impulse
in
stresses
that
for
the
beat
generation
sex
is
more
than
a
source
of
pleasure
it
is
a
mystique
and
their
private
language
is
rich
in
the
multivalent
ambiguities
of
sexual
reference
so
that
they
dwell
in
a
sexualized
universe
of
discourse
singular
uncompromising
force
of
their
revolt
against
the
cult
of
restraint
is
illustrated
by
their
refusal
to
dance
in
a
public
place
dance
is
but
a
disguised
ritual
for
the
expression
of
ungratified
sexual
desire
this
reason
too
their
language
is
more
forthright
and
earthy
beatniks
crave
a
sexual
experience
in
which
their
whole
being
participates
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
they
resist
the
lure
of
marriage
and
the
trap
of
domesticity
for
like
cats
they
are
determined
not
to
tame
their
sexual
energy
withdraw
to
the
underground
of
the
slums
where
they
can
defy
the
precepts
of
legalized
propriety
the
heroes
and
flappers
of
the
lost
generation
they
disdain
the
art
of
necking
and
petting
is
reserved
for
the
squares
they
avoid
the
use
of
the
pungent
outlawed
word
it
is
because
it
is
taboo
it
is
sacred
the
prophet
of
the
beat
generation
declares
the
sexual
act
the
beat
are
filled
with
mana
the
divine
power
is
far
from
the
vulgar
leering
sexuality
of
the
square
in
heat
is
the
these
knights
of
the
orgasm
pursue
this
is
the
irresistible
cosmic
urge
to
which
they
respond
is
the
who
has
led
them
out
of
the
of
sexual
slavery
is
the
poet
who
offers
them
the
dialectic
of
justification
for
their
indulgence
in
liquor
marijuana
sex
and
jazz
addition
they
have
been
converted
to
with
its
glorification
of
all
that
is
natural
and
mysteriously
alive
the
sense
that
everything
in
the
world
is
flowing
paradoxically
the
beat
writers
resort
to
religious
metaphors
they
are
in
search
of
mana
the
spiritual
the
numinous
but
not
anything
connected
with
formal
religion
they
are
after
is
the
beatific
vision
though
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
understand
how
these
internal
contradictions
are
reconciled
helps
them
in
their
struggle
to
achieve
personal
salvation
through
sexual
release
style
of
life
chosen
by
the
beat
generation
the
rhythm
and
ritual
they
have
adopted
as
uniquely
their
own
is
designed
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
sexual
experience
is
good
not
only
because
it
promotes
wholeness
but
because
of
its
decided
sexual
effect
is
the
musical
language
of
sex
the
vocabulary
of
the
orgasm
indeed
it
is
maintained
that
the
sexual
element
in
jazz
by
freeing
the
listener
of
his
inhibitions
can
have
therapeutic
value
is
why
the
argument
runs
the
squares
are
so
fearful
of
jazz
and
yet
perversely
fascinated
by
it
of
giving
themselves
spontaneously
to
the
orgiastic
release
that
jazz
can
give
them
they
undergo
psychoanalysis
or
flirt
with
mysticism
or
turn
to
prostitutes
for
satisfaction
jazz
is
transmuted
into
something
holy
the
sacred
road
to
integration
of
being
like
sex
is
a
mystique
is
not
a
substitute
for
sex
but
a
dynamic
expression
of
the
creative
impulse
in
unfettered
man
mystique
of
sex
combined
with
marijuana
and
jazz
is
intended
to
provide
a
design
for
living
who
are
sexually
liberated
can
become
creatively
alive
and
free
their
instincts
put
at
the
service
of
the
imagination
in
their
denunciation
of
all
that
makes
for
death
the
beat
prophets
bid
all
men
become
cool
cats
let
them
learn
to
swing
freely
to
let
go

themselves
and
then
perhaps
civilization
will
be
saved
beatnik
seceding
from
a
society
that
is
fatally
afflicted
with
a
deathward
drive
is
concerned
with
his
personal
salvation
in
the
living
present
he
is
the
child
of
nothingness
if
he
is
the
predestined
victim
of
an
age
of
atomic
wars
then
he
will
consult
only
his
own
organic
needs
and
go
beyond
good
and
evil
will
not
curb
his
instinctual
desires
but
release
the
energy
within
him
that
makes
him
feel
truly
and
fully
alive
even
if
it
is
only
for
this
brief
moment
before
the
apocalypse
of
annihilation
explodes
on
earth
is
why
the
members
of
the
beat
generation
proudly
assume
the
title
of
the
holy
barbarians
they
will
destroy
the
shrines
temples
museums
and
churches
of
the
state
that
is
the
implacable
enemy
of
the
life
they
believe
in
from
the
categorical
imperative
they
derive
from
the
metaphysics
of
the
orgasm
the
only
affirmation
they
are
capable
of
making
is
that
art
is
their
only
refuge
writing
born
of
their
experiments
in
marijuana
and
untrammeled
sexuality
reflects
the
extremity
of
their
existential
alienation
mind
has
betrayed
them
reason
is
the
foe
of
life
they
will
trust
only
their
physical
sensations
the
wisdom
of
the
body
the
holy
promptings
of
the
unconscious
lyrical
intensity
they
reveal
what
they
hate
but
their
faith
in
love
inspired
by
the
revolutionary
rhythms
of
jazz
culminates
in
the
climax
of
the
orgasm
work
mirrors
the
mentality
of
the
psychopath
rootless
and
irresponsible
rebellion
against
authoritarian
society
is
not
far
removed
from
the
violence
of
revolt
characteristic
of
the
juvenile
delinquent
the
life
they
lead
is
undisciplined
and
for
the
most
part
unproductive
even
though
they
make
a
fetish
of
devoting
themselves
to
some
creative
pursuit
writing
painting
music
are
on
principle
they
express
themselves
it
is
incandescent
hatred
that
shines
forth
the
rage
of
repudiation
the
ecstasy
of
negation
is
sex
that
obsesses
them
sex
that
is
at
the
basis
of
their
aesthetic
creed
they
discuss
with
dialectical
seriousness
is
the
degree
to
which
sex
can
inspire
the
is
the
vice
from
which
the
abjectly
fearful
middle
class
continue
to
suffer
whereas
the
beatnik
has
the
courage
to
break
out
of
that
prison
of
respectability
girl
describes
her
past
her
succession
of
broken
marriages
the
abortions
she
has
had
and
finally
confesses
that
she
loves
sex
and
sees
no
reason
why
she
must
justify
her
passion
it
is
an
honest
feeling
then
why
should
she
not
yield
to
it
often
she
says
the
monogamous
relationship
that
is
dishonest
is
nothing
holy
in
wedlock
girl
soon
drops
the
bourgeois
pyschiatrist
who
disapproves
of
her
life
finds
married
life
stifling
and
every
prolonged
sex
relationship
unbearably
monotonous
confession
serves
to
make
clear
in
part
what
is
behind
this
sexual
revolution
the
craving
for
sensation
for
its
own
sake
the
need
for
change
for
new
experiences
is
death
the
realm
of
physical
sensations
sex
reigns
supreme
the
beatniks
sustain
themselves
on
marijuana
jazz
free
swinging
poetry
exhausting
themselves
in
orgies
of
sex
some
of
them
are
driven
over
the
borderline
of
sanity
and
lose
contact
with
reality
beat

new
fact
the
initiates
of
this
cult
have
to
learn
is
that
they
must
move
toward
simplicity
professed
mission
of
this
disaffiliated
generation
is
to
find
a
new
way
of
life
which
they
can
express
in
poetry
and

but
what
they
produce
is
unfortunately
disordered
nourished
solely
on
the
hysteria
of
negation

of
this
movement
junkies

of
contempt
for

do
not
count

leagued
against
a
hostile
persecutory
world

with
the

the

is
the
rhetoric
of
righteousness
the
beatniks
use
in
defending
their
way
of
life
their
search
for
wholeness
though
their
actual
existence
fails
to
reach
these
religious
heights
beatnik
got
the
woman
he
was
living
with
so
involved
in
drugs
and
and
sessions
of
sex
that
she
was
beginning
to
crack
up
obsessions
had
she
picked
up
during
these
long
nights
of
talk
as
the
creative
principle
of
the
universe
the
secret
of
primitive
religion
the
life
of
myth
in
the
final
analysis
reduced
itself
to
sexual
symbolism
his
chapter
on
spares
the
reader
none
of
the
sordid
details
one
asks
questions
about
the
free
union
of
the
sexes
in
so
long
as
the
partners
share
the
negative
attitudes
of
the
group
women
who
come
to
having
forsaken
radicalism
are
interested
in
living
only
for
the
moment
in
being
constantly
on
the
move
who
are
attracted
to
this
of
the
beat
generation
are
homosexuals
heroin
addicts
and
smalltime
hoodlums
who
are
sexual
deviants
are
naturally
drawn
to
join
the
beatniks
the
homosexuals
widely
use
marijuana
they
do
not
have
to
be
initiated
of
the
ritual
of
sex
is
the
use
of
marijuana
puts
it
is
felt
in
the
magic
circle
of
marijuana
with
far
greater
force
as
a
unifying
principle
in
human
relationships
than
at
any
other
time
except
perhaps
in
the
mutual
metaphysical
orgasms
magic
circle
is
in
fact
a
symbol
of
and
preparation
for
the
metaphysical
orgasm
the
influence
of
marijuana
the
beatnik
comes
alive
within
and
experiences
a
wonderfully
enhanced
sense
of
self
as
if
he
had
discovered
the
open
sesame
to
the
universe
of
being
high
on
this
charge
he
composes
magical
poetry
that
captures
the
organic
rhythms
of
life
in
words
he
thus
achieves
a
lyrical
dreamlike
drugged
intensity
he
pays
the
price
for
his
indulgence
by
producing
work
is
a
striking
example
of
this
tendency
that
is
disoriented
but
without
depth
and
without
control
drugs
are
in
themselves
no
royal
road
to
creativity
is
the
beat
poet
to
achieve
unity
of
form
when
he
is
at
the
same
time
engaged
in
a
systematic
derangement
of
senses
love
reflects
the
nature
of
man
as
believes
if
the
person
in
love
betrays
decisively
what
he
is
by
his
behavior
in
love
then
the
writers
of
the
beat
generation
are
creating
a
new
literary
genre
were
fences
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
children
the
front
of
a
yard
and
down
the
side
they
were
iron
either
spiked
along
the
top
or
arched
in
half
circles
fences
were
made
of
solid
boards
higher
than
head
but
not
so
high
as
the
golden
glow
in
a
corner
or
the
hollyhocks
that
grew
in
a
line
against
them
fences
were
hidden
beneath
lilacs
and
roses
front
fences
were
covered
with
creeper
or
trumpet
vines
or
honeysuckle
and
gate
posts
were
an
pattern
of
foliage
they
were
topped
by
steeples
complete
in
every
detail
roof
pinnacle
and
narrow
gable
these
posts
the
gates
swung
open
with
a
squeak
and
shut
with
a
metallic
clang
only
extended
view
possible
to
anyone
less
tall
than
the
fences
was
that
obtained
from
an
upper
bough
of
the
apple
tree
primary
quality
of
that
view
seems
now
to
have
been
its
quietness
but
that
cannot
at
the
time
have
impressed
us
one
actually
remembers
is
its
greenness
high
in
the
tree
the
whole
block
lay
within
range
of
the
eye
but
the
ground
was
almost
nowhere
visible
looked
down
on
a
sea
of
leaves
a
breaking
wave
of
flower
path
from
back
door
to
barn
was
covered
by
a
and
every
yard
had
its
fruit
trees
the
center
of
any
open
space
remaining
our
grandfathers
had
planted
syringa
and
snowball
and
above
one
could
only
occasionally
catch
a
glimpse
of
life
on
the
floor
of
this
green
sea
a
gingham
skirt
flashing
into
sight
for
an
instant
on
the
path
beneath
her
or
the
movement
of
hands
above
a
clothesline
and
the
flutter
of
garments
hung
there
down
the
block
was
one
epoch
the
epoch
had
ended
before
it
began
is
a
queer
thing
and
memory
a
queerer
the
tricks
that
time
plays
with
memory
and
memory
with
time
are
queerest
of
all
maturity
one
looks
back
at
the
succession
of
years
counts
them
and
makes
them
many
yet
cannot
feel
length
in
the
number
however
large
a
stream
that
turns
a
there
is
a
lot
of
water
the
is
quiet
its
surface
dark
and
shadowed
and
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
water
in
it
in
the
sum
is
nothing
yet
a
year
to
a
child
is
an
eternity
and
in
the
memory
that
phase
of
being
a
certain
mental
landscape
will
seem
to
have
endured
without
beginning
and
without
end
part
of
the
mind
that
preserves
dates
and
events
may
remonstrate
could
have
been
like
that
for
only
a
little
while
but
true
memory
does
not
count
nor
add
it
holds
fast
to
things
that
were
and
they
are
outside
of
time
then
for
how
many
years
or
how
few
does
not
matter
my
world
was
bound
round
by
fences
when
was
too
small
to
reach
the
apple
tree
bough
to
twist
my
knee
over
it
and
pull
myself
up
world
was
in
scale
with
my
own
smallness
have
no
picture
in
my
mind
of
the
garden
as
a
whole
that
could
not
see
but
certain
aspects
of
certain
corners
linger
in
the
memory
white
chrysanthemums
beneath
a
window
with
their
brittle
brown
leaves
and
their
sharp
scent
of
ripe
pears
lying
in
long
grass
to
be
turned
over
by
a
foot
cautiously
lest
bees
still
worked
in
the
ragged
holes
verbenas
in
the
corner
between
the
wall
and
the
side
porch
where
we
passed
on
our
way
to
the
pump
with
the
tied
to
it
as
a
cup
by
my
grandmother
for
our
childish
pleasure
in
drinking
from
it
was
mother
who
planted
the
verbenas
think
that
my
grandmother
was
not
an
impassioned
gardener
she
was
too
indulgent
a
lover
of
dogs
and
grandchildren
have
been
told
made
her
garden
her
great
pride
she
cherished
rare
and
delicate
plants
like
oleanders
in
tubs
and
and
lemon
verbenas
in
pots
that
had
to
be
wintered
in
the
cellar
she
filled
the
waste
spots
of
the
yard
with
common
things
like
the
garden
heliotrope
in
a
corner
by
the
woodshed
and
the
plantain
lilies
along
the
west
side
of
the
house
my
grandmother
left
in
their
places
they
are
still
there
more
persistent
and
than
the
generations
of
man
and
planted
others
like
them
that
flourished
without
careful
tending
of
these
only
were
protected
from
us
by
stern
commandment
the
roses
whose
petals
might
not
be
collected
until
they
had
fallen
to
be
made
into
perfume
or
to
drink
the
peonies
whose
tight
sticky
buds
would
be
blighted
by
the
laying
on
of
a
finger
although
they
were
not
apparently
harmed
by
the
ants
that
crawled
over
them
and
the
poppies
have
more
than
once
sat
in
the
grass
through
a
long
summer
morning
and
watched
without
touching
while
a
poppy
bud
higher
than
my
head
slowly
but
visibly
pushed
off
its
cap
unfolded
and
shook
out
like
a
banner
in
the
sun
its
flaming
vermilion
petals
flowers
we
might
gather
as
we
pleased
myrtle
and
white
violets
from
beneath
the
lilacs
the
lilacs
themselves
that
bloomed
so
prodigally
but
for
the
most
part
beyond
our
reach
snowballs
hollyhock
blossoms
that
turned
upside
down
make
ladies
and
the
little
dark
blue
larkspur
that
scattered
its
seed
everywhere
potent
a
charm
to
bring
back
that
time
of
life
than
this
record
of
a
few
pictures
and
a
few
remembered
facts
would
be
a
catalogue
of
the
minutiae
which
are
of
the
very
stuff
of
the
mind
intrinsic
because
they
were
known
in
the
beginning
not
by
the
eye
alone
but
by
the
hand
that
held
them
stones
and
small
creatures
living
and
dead
yellow
snapdragons
that
by
pinching
could
be
made
to
bite
of
the
balsams
that
snapped
like
at
a
touch
columbines
whose
spurs
were
picked
off
and
eaten
for
the
honey
in
them
buds
which
could
be
so
grasped
and
squeezed
that
they
burst
like
a
paper
bag
bright
flowers
from
the
trumpet
vine
that
made
gloves
on
the
ends
of
ten
waggling
fingers
caterpillars
snails
with
their
sensitive
horns
struggling
grasshoppers
held
by
their
long
hind
legs
and
commanded
to
spit
tobacco
spit
fledgling
birds
their
nakedness
and
the
odor
of
decay
that
clung
to
the
hand
when
they
had
been
buried
in
our
graveyard
in
front
of
the
purple
flags
the
cast
shell
of
a
locust
and
transparent
weighing
nothing
fragile
but
entire
with
eyes
like
bubbles
and
a
gaping
slit
down
its
back
morning
early
in
the
summer
we
searched
the
trunks
of
the
trees
as
high
as
we
could
reach
for
the
locust
shells
carefully
detached
their
hooked
claws
from
the
bark
where
they
hung
and
stabled
them
a
weird
faery
herd
in
an
angle
between
the
high
roots
of
the
tulip
tree
where
no
grass
grew
in
the
dense
shade
collected
lucky
stones
all
the
creamy
translucent
pebbles
worn
smooth
and
round
that
we
could
find
in
the
driveway
these
had
been
pocketed
we
could
still
spend
a
morning
cracking
open
other
pebbles
for
our
delight
in
seeing
how
much
prettier
they
were
inside
than
their
dull
exteriors
indicated
showed
them
to
each
other
and
said
you
have
guessed
on
our
haunches
beside
the
flat
stone
we
broke
them
on
we
were
safe
behind
the
high
closed
gates
at
the
end
of
the
drive
safe
from
interruption
and
the
observation
and
possible
amusement
of
the
shielded
we
played
many
foolish
games
in
comfortable
unselfconsciousness
even
when
the
fences
became
a
part
of
the
game
when
a
was
the
enchanted
castle
or
when
let
down
her
golden
hair
from
beneath
the
crocketed
spire
even
then
we
paid
little
heed
to
those
who
went
by
on
the
path
outside
enjoyed
a
paradoxical
freedom
when
we
were
still
too
young
for
school
the
heat
of
the
summer
the
garden
solitudes
were
ours
alone
our
elders
stayed
in
the
dark
house
or
sat
fanning
on
the
front
porch
never
troubled
themselves
about
us
while
we
were
playing
because
the
fence
formed
such
a
definite
boundary
and
go
outside
the
gate
was
a
command
so
impossible
of
misinterpretation
were
not
however
entirely
unacquainted
with
the
varying
aspects
of
the
street
were
forbidden
to
swing
on
the
gates
lest
they
sag
on
their
hinges
in
a
way
but
we
could
stand
on
them
when
they
were
latched
rest
our
chins
on
the
top
and
stare
and
stare
committing
to
memory
quite
unintentionally
all
the
details
that
lay
before
our
eyes
street
that
is
full
now
of
traffic
and
parked
cars
then
and
for
many
years
drowsed
on
an
afternoon
in
the
shade
of
the
curbside
trees
and
silence
was
a
weight
almost
palpable
in
the
air
slight
sound
that
rose
against
that
pressure
fell
away
again
crushed
beneath
it
moved
slowly
along
the
gutter
the
top
of
it
swept
by
the
low
boughs
of
the
maple
trees
and
loose
straws
were
left
hanging
tangled
among
the
leaves
wheel
squeaked
on
a
hub
was
still
and
squeaked
again
a
child
watched
its
progress
he
whispered
hay
load
of
hay
make
a
wish
and
turn
away
and
then
stared
rigidly
in
the
opposite
direction
until
the
sound
of
the
feet
returned
no
more
the
hay
wagon
had
gone
and
an
interval
passed
a
cart
might
turn
the
corner
horse
walked
the
reins
were
slack
the
huckster
rode
with
bowed
shoulders
his
forearms
across
his
knees
as
if
to
break
the
silence
he
lifted
his
voice
nice
fresh
today
lazy
was
spaced
in
time
like
the
drone
of
a
one
seemed
to
hear
him
no
one
heeded
horse
plodded
on
and
he
repeated
his
call
became
so
monotonous
as
to
seem
a
part
of
the
quietness
his
passage
the
street
was
empty
again
sun
moved
across
the
sky
and
down
the
shadows
circled
from
street
to
sidewalk
from
sidewalk
to
lawn
or
the
coming
of
the
newsboy
marked
the
end
of
the
day
he
tossed
a
paper
toward
every
front
door
and
housewives
came
down
to
their
steps
to
pick
them
up
and
read
what
their
neighbors
had
been
doing
streets
of
any
county
town
were
like
this
on
any
sunshiny
afternoon
in
summer
they
were
like
this
years
ago
and
yesterday
the
fences
were
still
in
place
years
ago
and
when
we
stood
on
the
gate
to
look
over
the
sidewalk
under
our
eyes
was
not
cement
but
two
rows
of
paving
stones
with
grass
between
and
on
both
sides
curb
was
a
line
of
stone
laid
edgewise
in
the
dirt
and
tilted
this
way
and
that
by
frost
in
the
ground
or
the
roots
of
trees
every
gate
was
a
hitching
post
or
a
stone
set
with
a
rusty
iron
ring
for
tying
a
horse
street
was
unpaved
and
rose
steeply
toward
the
center
it
was
mud
in
wet
weather
and
dust
in
dry
and
could
be
crossed
only
at
the
corner
where
there
were
stepping
stones
had
a
bucolic
atmosphere
that
it
has
lost
long
since
hoofmarks
of
cattle
and
the
prints
of
bare
feet
in
the
mud
or
in
the
dust
were
as
numerous
as
the
traces
of
shod
horses
were
kept
in
backyard
barns
boys
were
hired
to
drive
them
to
and
from
the
pasture
on
the
edge
of
town
and
familiar
to
the
ear
morning
and
evening
were
the
coaxing
voices
the
thud
of
hooves
and
the
thwack
of
a
stick
on
cowhide
is
worth
dwelling
in
some
detail
on
the
crisis
of
this
story
because
it
brings
together
a
number
of
characteristic
elements
and
makes
of
them
a
curious
riddling
compound
obscurely
but
centrally
significant
for
work
wife
and
her
lover
are
both
savagely
portrayed
she
as
incarnate
sensuality
voluptuous
and
indolent
possibly
a
mischief
maker
with
a
kind
of
luxurious
cunning
to
set
against
her
apparent
simplicity
her
birdlike
brain
for
his
part
belonged
to
the
race
of
small
artists
who
do
not
demand
the
utmost
of
themselves
and
the
bitter
description
of
the
type
includes
such
epithets
as
wretched
little
poseurs
the
devastating
indictment
they
do
not
know
how
to
be
wretched
decently
and
in
order
and
the
somewhat
extreme
prophecy
so
far
not
fulfilled
will
be
destroyed
trick
these
two
play
upon
reveals
their
want
not
simply
of
decency
but
of
imagination
as
well
appearance
as
evokes
not
amusement
but
horror
in
the
audience
it
is
a
spectacle
absolutely
painful
an
epiphany
of
the
suffering
flesh
unredeemed
by
spirit
untouched
by
any
spirit
other
than
abasement
and
humiliation
the
same
time
the
multiple
transvestitism
involved
the
fat
man
as
girl
and
as
baby
as
coquette
pretending
to
be
a
baby
touches
for
a
moment
horrifyingly
upon
the
secret
sources
of
a
life
like
upon
the
sinister
dreams
which
form
the
sources
of
any
human
life
music
which
has
composed
for
this
episode
is
for
the
most
part
rather
pretty
and
perfectly
banal
it
is
characteristic
of
him
we
are
told
his
little
artifice
to
be
able
to
introduce
into
a
fairly
vulgar
and
humorous
piece
of
hackwork
a
sudden
phrase
of
genuine
creative
art
this
occurs
now
at
the
refrain
of
song
at
the
point
in
fact
of
the
name
a
modulation
described
as
almost
a
stroke
of
genius
miracle
a
revelation
it
was
like
a
curtain
suddenly
torn
away
to
reveal
something
nude
is
this
modulation
which
reveals
to
his
own
frightful
abjection
and
simultaneously
his
infidelity
the
same
means
he
perceives
this
fact
as
having
communicated
itself
to
the
audience
he
collapses
and
dies
the
work
of
every
artist
suppose
there
may
be
found
one
or
more
moments
which
strike
the
student
as
absolutely
decisive
ultimately
emblematic
of
what
it
is
all
about
not
less
strikingly
so
for
being
mysterious
as
though
some
deeply
hidden
constatation
of
thoughts
were
enciphered
in
a
single
image
a
single
moment
here
horrifying
humor
the
specifically
sexual
embarrassment
of
the
joke
gone
wrong
the
monstrous
image
of
the
fat
man
dressed
up
as
a
whore
dressing
up
as
a
baby
the
epiphany
of
that
quivering
flesh
the
bringing
together
around
it
of
the
secret
liaison
between
indolent
mindless
sensuality
and
sharp
shrewd
talent
cleverness
with
an
occasional
touch
of
genius
which
however
does
not
know
how
to
attack
the
problem
of
suffering
the
miraculous
way
in
which
music
revelation
and
death
are
associated
in
a
single
instant
all
this
seems
a
triumph
of
art
a
rather
desperate
art
in
itself
beyond
itself
also
it
evokes
numerous
and
distant
resonances
from
the
entire
body
of
work
try
to
work
out
my
reasons
for
feeling
that
this
passage
is
of
critical
significance
come
up
with
the
following
ideas
which
shall
express
very
briefly
here
and
revert
to
in
a
later
essay
is
the
crucial
dilemma
of
experience
for
heroes
dramatic
construction
of
his
stories
characteristically
turns
on
a
situation
in
which
someone
is
simultaneously
compelled
and
forbidden
to
love
release
the
freedom
involved
in
loving
another
is
either
terribly
difficult
or
else
absolutely
impossible
and
the
motion
toward
it
brings
disaster
prohibition
on
love
has
an
especially
poignant
relation
to
art
it
is
particularly
the
artist
who
suffers
from
it
specific
analogy
to
the
dilemma
of
love
is
the
problem
of
the
breakthrough
in
the
realm
of
art
the
sufferings
and
disasters
produced
by
any
transgression
against
the
commandment
not
to
love
are
almost
invariably
associated
in
one
way
or
another
with
childhood
with
the
figure
of
a
child
the
theatrical
and
perversely
erotic
notions
of
dressing
up
cosmetics
disguise
and
especially
change
of
costume
or
singularity
of
costume
as
with
are
characteristically
associated
with
the
catastrophes
of
stories
shall
return
to
these
statements
and
deal
with
them
more
fully
as
the
evidence
for
them
accumulates
the
present
it
is
enough
to
note
that
in
the
grotesque
figure
of
at
the
moment
of
his
collapse
all
these
elements
come
together
in
prophetic
parody
a
lawyer
that
is
to
say
associated
with
dignity
reserve
discipline
with
much
that
is
essentially
he
is
compelled
by
an
impossible
love
to
exhibit
himself
dressed
up
disguised
that
is
paradoxically
revealed
as
a
child
and
worse
as
a
whore
masquerading
as
a
child
this
abandonment
takes
place
on
a
stage
during
an
artistic
performance
is
enough
to
associate
with
art
and
to
bring
down
upon
him
the
punishment
for
art
that
is
he
is
suspect
guilty
punishable
as
is
anyone
in
stories
who
produces
illusion
and
this
is
true
even
though
the
constant
elements
of
the
technique
magic
guilt
and
suffering
are
divided
in
this
story
between
and
appears
that
the
dominant
tendency
of
early
tales
however
pictorial
or
even
picturesque
the
surface
is
already
toward
the
symbolic
the
emblematic
the
expressionistic
a
certain
perfectly
definite
way
the
method
and
the
theme
of
his
stories
are
one
and
the
same
of
this
can
be
learned
from
an
anecdote
about
an
old
failure
whose
fit
of
anger
at
a
passing
cyclist
causes
him
to
die
of
a
stroke
or
seizure
is
no
more
plot
than
that
only
slightly
more
perhaps
than
a
newspaper
account
of
such
an
incident
would
give
artistic
interest
then
lies
in
what
the
encounter
may
be
made
to
represent
in
the
power
of
some
central
significance
to
draw
the
details
into
relevance
and
meaningfulness
first
sentence
with
its
platitudinous
irony
announces
an
emblematic
intent
way
to
the
churchyard
ran
along
beside
the
highroad
ran
beside
it
all
the
way
to
the
end
that
is
to
say
to
the
churchyard
the
action
is
consistently
presented
with
regard
for
this
distinction
highroad
one
might
say
at
first
belongs
to
life
while
the
way
to
the
churchyard
belongs
to
death
that
is
too
simple
and
hold
up
the
first
sentence
suggests
both
roads
belong
to
death
in
the
end
the
highroad
according
to
the
description
of
its
traffic
belongs
to
life
as
it
is
lived
in
unawareness
of
death
while
the
way
to
the
churchyard
belongs
to
some
other
sort
of
life
a
suffering
form
an
existence
wholly
comprised
in
the
awareness
of
death
on
the
highroad
a
troop
of
soldiers
marched
in
their
own
dust
and
sang
while
on
the
footpath
one
man
walks
alone
isolation
is
not
merely
momentary
it
is
permanent
is
a
widower
his
three
children
are
dead
he
has
no
one
left
on
earth
also
he
is
a
drunk
and
has
lost
his
job
on
that
account
name
is
and
he
is
rather
fully
described
as
to
his
clothing
and
physiognomy
in
a
way
which
relates
him
to
a
sinister
type
in
the
repertory
he
is
a
forerunner
of
those
enigmatic
strangers
in
for
example
who
represent
some
combination
of
cadaver
exotic
and
psychopomp
strange
person
quarrels
with
a
cyclist
because
the
latter
is
using
the
path
rather
than
the
highroad
cyclist
a
sufficiently
commonplace
young
fellow
is
not
named
but
identified
simply
as
that
and
a
license
number
which
uses
in
addressing
him
points
out
that
everybody
uses
this
path
and
starts
to
ride
on
tries
to
stop
him
by
force
receives
a
push
in
the
chest
from
and
is
left
standing
in
impotent
and
growing
rage
while
a
crowd
begins
to
gather
rage
assumes
a
religious
form
that
is
on
the
basis
of
his
own
sinfulness
and
abject
wretchedness
becomes
a
prophet
who
in
his
ecstasy
and
in
the
name
of
imprecates
doom
on
not
only
the
cyclist
now
but
the
audience
the
world
as
well
all
you
breed
passion
brings
on
a
fit
which
proves
fatal
an
ambulance
comes
along
and
they
drive
away
is
simple
enough
but
several
more
points
of
interest
may
be
mentioned
as
relevant
season
between
spring
and
summer
belongs
to
life
in
its
carefree
aspect
fatal
rage
arises
not
only
because
he
cannot
stop
the
cyclist
but
also
because
will
not
stop
him
as
says
to
the
crowd
in
his
last
moments
justice
is
not
of
this
world
is
further
characterized
in
antithesis
to
as
animal
the
image
of
a
dog
which
appears
at
several
places
is
first
given
as
the
criterion
of
amiable
irrelevant
interest
aroused
by
life
considered
simply
as
a
spectacle
a
dog
in
a
wagon
is
admirable
a
pleasure
to
contemplate
another
wagon
has
no
dog
and
therefore
is
devoid
of
interest
calls
the
cyclist
cur
and
puppy
among
other
things
and
at
the
crisis
of
his
fit
a
little
stands
before
him
and
howls
into
his
face
ambulance
is
drawn
by
two
charming
little
horses
is
not
certainly
religious
in
any
conventional
sense
religiousness
is
intimately
or
dialectically
connected
with
his
sinfulness
the
two
may
in
fact
be
identical
unsuccessful
strivings
to
give
up

are
represented
as
religious
strivings
he
keeps
a
bottle
in
a
wardrobe
at
home
and
before
this
wardrobe
had
before
now
gone
literally
on
his
knees
and
in
his
wrestlings
had
bitten
his
tongue
and
still
in
the
end
capitulated

contrast

is
simply
unreflective
unproblematic
blithe
and
carefree
made
no
claims
to
belong
to
the
great
and
mighty
of
this
earth
is
grotesque
a
disturbing
parody
his
end
is
ridiculous
and
trivial
is
a
man
raving
mad
on
the
way
to
the
churchyard
he
is
more
interesting
than
the
others
the
ones
who
come
from
the
highroad
to
watch
him
more
interesting
than
considered
as
a
cyclist
if
have
gone
into
so
much
detail
about
so
small
a
work
that
is
because
it
is
also
so
typical
a
work
representing
the
germinal
form
of
a
conflict
which
remains
essential
in
writing
the
crude
sketch
of
contains
in
its
critical
destructive
and
tendencies
much
that
is
enlarged
and
illuminated
in
the
figures
of
for
instance
and
method
as
well
as
in
theme
this
little
anecdote
with
its
details
selected
as
much
for
expressiveness
and
allegory
as
for
realism
anticipates
a
kind
of
musical
composition
as
well
as
a
kind
of
fictional
composition
in
which
as
says
there
shall
be
nothing
unthematic
resembles
too
pictures
such
as
and
did
in
which
all
that
looks
at
first
to
be
solely
pictorial
proves
on
inspection
to
be
also
literary
the
representation
of
a
proverb
for
example
or
a
deadly
sin
resembles
in
its
representation
of
a
conflict
between
light
and
dark
between
and
a
spirit
of
criticism
negation
melancholy
but
it
goes
considerably
further
in
characterizing
the
elements
of
this
conflict

his

in

his

ridiculous
and

a
holocaust

been
developing
over
a
long
period

of
classical
structures
of
meaning
in
all
realms
of
western
culture
has
given
rise
to
several
generations
of
artists
who
have
documented
the
disintegrative
processes

fragmentation

quality

given
rise
to
a
compensatory
response
in
the
form

a
heroic
and

individualistic
humanism

neither

nor
love

as
it

whatever
the
tension

two
approaches
to

the
artistic
imagination
it

seen
that

exclusive
that
they
belong
together

reference

the
stress
on

invention
would
never
have
been
stimulated
into
being
although
these
insights
into
the
nature
of
art
may
be
in
themselves
insufficient
for
a
thoroughgoing
philosophy
of
art
their
peculiar
authenticity
in
this
day
and
age
requires
that
they
be
taken
seriously
and
gives
promise
that
from
their
very
substance
new
and
valid
chapters
in
the
philosophy
of
art
may
be
written
better
or
worse
we
cannot
regard
imitation
in
the
arts
in
the
simple
mode
of
classical
rationalism
or
detached
realism
broader
concept
of
imitation
is
needed
one
which
acknowledges
that
true
invention
is
important
that
the
creativity
in
part
transcends
the
causal
factors
out
of
which
it
arises
the
other
hand
we
cannot
regard
artistic
invention
as
pure
uncaused
and
unrelated
to
the
times
in
which
it
occurs
need
a
doctrine
of
imitation
to
save
us
from
the
solipsism
and
futility
of
pure
formalism
it
is
the
aim
of
this
essay
to
advance
a
new
theory
of
imitation
which
shall
call
mimesis
in
order
to
distinguish
it
from
earlier
theories
of
imitation
and
a
new
theory
of
invention
which
shall
call
symbol
for
reasons
to
be
stated
hereafter
mimetic
imagination
in
the
arts
word
mimesis
imitation
is
usually
associated
with
and
imitation
is
twice
removed
from

in

chosen

use
the

mimesis

its
rather
than
its
classic
implications
and
to
discover
in
the
concrete
forms
of
both
art
and
myth
powers
of
theological
expression
which
as
in
the
mind
are
the
direct
consequence
of
involvement
in
historical
experience
which
are
not
reserved
as
in
the
mind
only
to
moments
of
theoretical
reflection
the
first
instance
mimesis
is
here
used
to
mean
the
recalling
of
experience
in
terms
of
vivid
images
rather
than
in
terms
of
abstract
ideas
or
conventional
designations
image
is
meant
not
only
a
visual
presentation
but
also
remembered
sensations
of
any
of
the
five
senses
plus
the
feelings
which
are
immediately
conjoined
therewith
is
the
primary
function
of
the
imagination
operating
in
the
absence
of
the
original
experiential
stimulus
by
which
the
images
were
first
appropriated
is
the
nearest
possible
thing
to
the
actual
of
experience
in
which
the
imagining
person
recovers
through
images
something
of
the
force
and
depth
characteristic
of
experience
itself
images
themselves
like
their
counterparts
in
experience
are
not
neutral
qualities
to
be
surveyed
dispassionately
they
are
fields
of
force
exerting
a
unique
influence
on
the
sensibilities
and
a
unique
relatedness

one
another
bring
an
inextricable
component
of
value
within
themselves
with
attractions
and
repulsions
native
to
their
own
quality
in
experience
one
is
seized
by
given
entities
and
their
interrelations
and
is
forced
to
respond
in
value
feelings
to
them
so
one
is
similarly
seized
in
the
mimetic
presentation
of
images
here
is
not
to
be
confused
with
literalism
or
realism
in
the
conventional
sense
word
taken
in
its
dictionary
meaning
a
photographic
image
of
a
recognizable
object
the
mere
picturing
of
a
scene
tends
to
lose
experiential
vividness
and
to
connote
such
conventional
abstractions
as
to
invite
neutral
reception
without
the
incitement
of
value
feelings
experience
itself
can
be
conventionalized
so
that
people
react
to
certain
preconceived
clues
for
behavior
without
awareness
of
the
vitality
of
their
experiential
field
truly
vivid
imagination
moves
beyond
the
conventional
recollection
to
a
sense
of
immediacy
mimetic
character
of
the
imaginative
consciousness
tends
to
express
itself
in
the
presentation
of
artistic
forms
and
materials
words
can
be
used
in
a
more
fresh
and
primitive
way
so
that
they
strike
with
the
force
of
sights
and
sounds
when
tones
of
sound
and
colors
of
paint
and
the
carven
shape
all
strike
the
sensibilities
with
an
undeniable
force
of
data
in
and
of
themselves
compelling
the
observer
into
an
attitude
of
attention
all
this
imitates
the
way
experience
itself
in
its
deepest
character
strikes
upon
the
door
of
consciousness
and
clamors
for
entrance
are
like
the
initial
ways
in
which
the
world
forces
itself
upon
the
self
and
thrusts
the
self
into
decision
and
choice
presence
of
genuine
mimesis
in
art
is
marked
by
the
persistence
with
which
the
work
demands
attention
and
compels
valuation
even
though
it
is
but
vaguely
understood
these
conceptions
of
mimesis
are
certain
presuppositions
concerning
the
nature
of
primary
human
experience
which
require
some
exposition
before
the
main
argument
can
proceed
is
not
seen
as
it
is
in

rationalism

us
initially
with

their

and

the

according
to
the
attitude
of
modern
empiricism
in
which
nothing
is
thought
to
be
received

than

of
sensory
qualities
producing
their
responses

principal
defender

impressions
he

those
of
being

have

the

of
these

as
in
some
degree
wholesome
or

abstractive
and
rational
processes
may
indicate
errors
of
judgment
in
these
apprehensions
of
value
but
the
apprehensions
themselves
are
the
primary
stuff
of
experience
takes
a
great
deal
of
abstraction
to
free
oneself
from
the
primitive
impression
of
larger
unities
of
power
and
influence
and
to
view
world
simply
as
a
collection
of
sense
data
arranged
in

such
sequence

pattern
devoid

all

except
in
so
far
as
they
present
themselves
for
inspection
is
here
questioning
understanding
of
the
nature
of
experience
he
is
questioning
also
every
epistemology
which
stems
from
presupposition
that
experience
is
merely
sense
data
in
abstraction
from
causal
efficacy
and
that
causal
efficacy
is
something
intellectually
imputed
to
the
world
not
directly
perceived
calls
sensation
is
what
calls
perception
in
the
mode
of
presentational
immediacy
which
is
a
sophisticated
abstraction
from
perception
in
the
mode
of
causal
efficacy
long
as
perception
is
seen
as
composed
only
of
isolated
sense
data
most
of
the
quality
and
interconnectedness
of
existence
loses
its
objectivity
becomes
an
invention
of
consciousness
and
the
result
is
a
philosophical
scepticism
contends
that
the
human
way
of
understanding
existence
as
a
unity
of
interlocking
and
interdependent
processes
which
constitute
each
other
and
which
cause
each
other
to
be
and
not
to
be
is
possible
only
because
the
basic
form
of
such
an
understanding
for
all
its
vagueness
and
tendency
to
mistake
the
detail
is
initially
given
in
the
way
man
feels
the
world
this
respect
experience
is
broader
and
full
of
a
richer
variety
of
potential
meanings
than
the
mind
of
man
or
any
of
his
arts
or
culture
are
capable
of
making
clear
and
distinct
chief
characteristic
of
experience
in
the
mode
of
causal
efficacy
is
one
of
derivation
from
the
past
and
my
feelings
come
up
out
of
a
chain
of
events
that
fan
out
into
the
past
into
sources
that
are
ultimately
very
unlike
the
entity
which
now
am
only
eighteen
years
of
there
were
already
indications
of
melioration
though
in
a
slight
degree
to
be
sure
were
more
indications
by
the
century
leave
it
to
the
statisticians
to
say
what
they
were
but
noticed
several
a
few
years
ago
during
an
automobile
ride
from
to
town
after
town
my
companion
pointed
out
the
school
and
the
school
and
in
every
instance
the
former
made
a
better
appearance
it
was
newer
for
one
thing
really
looked
as
if
a
change
of
the
sort
predicted
by
had
been
going
on
with
the
renewal
of
interference
in
as
with
its
beginning
in

impaired

a
hundred

felt
that
the
was

feeling

is
being
picked
on
continually
constantly
what
right
of

virtue
ask

the

this
traditional
strategy
of
the
has
been
to

that

no

looks
pretty
tokenish

in

confess

that

a

that

by

from
whom
the
old

wished
to

practically
unknown
to
readers
of
these
there
are
surely
few
that
would
be
more
rewarding
discoveries
than
the
poet
and
novelist
who
received
the
award
in
and
whose
centennial
was
celebrated
two
years
ago
a
master
of
prose
and
verse
he
recreates
the
glory
of
in
the
past
and
continues
it
into
the
present
the
following
sketch
we
shall
present
a
brief
outline
of
his
life
and
let
him
as
much
as
possible
speak
for
himself
was
born
in
of
a
prosperous
family
his
side
he
was
of
descent
on
his
he
came
of
the
old
nobility
family
estate
was
situated
near
on
in
south
central
is
a
lonely
rather
desolate
region
but
full
of
legendary
and
historic
associations
a
boy
in
a
local
school
he
was
shy
and
solitary
absorbed
in
his
fondness
for
nature
and
his
visions
of
ancient
glory
liked
to
fancy
himself
as
a
chieftain
and
to
dress
for
the
part
somewhat
delicate
in
health
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
was
sent
to
for
which
he
at
once
developed
a
passion
so
that
he
spent
nearly
all
of
the
following
ten
years
abroad
at
first
in
then
in
and
one
of
his
summers
at
home
he
married
to
the
great
disapproval
of
his
father
who
objected
because
of
his
extreme
youth
to
become
a
painter
he
entered
the
studio
of
in
where
he
enjoyed
the
life
of
the
artists
but
soon
found
that
whatever
talent
he
might
have
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
gives
us
an
account
of
this
in
his
lively
and
humorous
poem
scanned
the
world
through
printed
symbol
swart
through
the
rags
strove
to
see
inner
man
looked
unceasingly
my
cold
mind
and
with
my
burning
heart
this
final
line
we
have
the
key
to
his
nature
writers
have
better
understood
their
deepest
selves
could
never
be
satisfied
by
surface
may
however
be
noted
that
his
gift
for
color
and
imagery
must
have
been
greatly
stimulated
by
his
stay
in
first
result
of
long
sojourn
abroad
was
a
volume
of
poems
och
published
in
was
a
brilliant
debut
so
much
so
indeed
that
it
aroused
a
new
vitality
in
the
younger
poets
as
did
foremost
critic
of
the
period
acclaims
it
as
follows
this
we
have
the
verse
of
a
painter
strongly
colorful
plastic
racy
vivid
a
bold
sometimes
careless
form
there
is
nothing
academic
all
is
seen
and
felt
and
experienced
the
observation
is
sharp
and
the
imagination
lively
young
reproduces
the
life
of
the
streets
he
tells
stories
of
the
and
and
conjures
up
before
us
the
bazaars
of
the
indolence
of
the
he
sees
the
last
reflection
of
the
old
happy
existence
and
for
that
reason
he
loves
it
yet
amid
all
the
gay
hedonism
in
is
a
cycle
of
short
poems
filled
with
brooding
melancholy
and
sombre
longing
the
longer
pieces
of
the
volume
none
is
so
memorable
as
which
at
once
took
rank
among
the
finest
poems
ever
written
in
the
language
celebrates
the
unknown
architect
who
designed
the
temple
of
at
next
to
the
the
noblest
example
of
classic
style
now
in
existence
the
eve
of
his
return
to
their
native
he
speaks
with
his
wife
of
the
masterpiece
which
rises
before
them
in
its
completed
perfection
supreme
object
of
their
lives
is
now
fulfilled
says
the
wife
her
husband
has
achieved
immortality
so
he
answers
it
is
not
the
architect
but
the
temple
that
is
immortal
true
reputation
is
his
work
short
poems
grouped
at
the
end
of
the
volume
as
in
is
as
indicated
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
others
consists
of
fragmentary
personal
revelations
such
as
is
a
spark
dwells
deep
within
my
soul
get
it
out
into
the
glow
my
aim
both
first
and
last
the
whole
slips
away
it
burns
and
tortures
me
little
spark
is
all
the
wealth
know
little
spark
is
my
misery
dominant
motive
is
the
longing
for
his
homeland
and
its
boyhood
associations
but
the
fields
where
would
stray
stones
where
as
a
child
used
to
play
is
utterly
disappointed
in
himself
and
in
the
desultory
life
he
has
been
leading
he
really
wants
is
to
find
a
sacred
cause
to
which
he
can
honestly
devote
himself
restless
individualism
found
its
answer
when
he
returned
to
live
nearly
all
the
rest
of
his
life
in
cause
was
to
commemorate
the
glory
of
her
past
and
to
incite
her
people
to
perpetuate
it
in
the
present
did
not
however
find
himself
at
once
next
major
work
completed
in
was
a
long
fantastic
epic
in
prose
entitled
which
describes
as
a
monument
on
the
grave
of
his
carefree
and
indolent
youth
hero
who
is
himself
is
represented
as
a
pilgrim
in
the
storied
lands
of
the
a
sort
of
type
who
to
quote
from
again
even
in
the
pleasure
gardens
of
can
not
cease
from
his
painful
search
after
the
meaning
of
life
is
driven
back
by
his
yearning
to
the
wintry
homeland
of
his
fathers
in
the
forest
of
this
time
on
proceeded
to
find
his
deeper
self
the
death
of
his
father
in
he
had
come
into
possession
of
the
family
estate
and
had
its
traditions
did
not
however
settle
back
into
acquiescence
with
things
as
they
were
his
friend
and
contemporary
he
had
little
patience
with
collective
mediocrity
saw
as
a
country
of
smug
and
narrow
provincialism
indifferent
to
the
heroic
spirit
of
its
former
glory
remedy
for
this
condition
was
to
tear
down
the
old
structures
and
build
anew
from
the
ground
up
conception
on
the
contrary
was
to
revive
the
present
by
the
memories
of
the
past
in
prose
or
poetry
all
of
later
work
was
concerned
with
the
first
of
a
group
of
historical
novels
published
in
he
achieved
the
masterpiece
of
his
career
scope
and
power
it
can
only
be
compared
to
as
long
it
is
less
intimate
and
detailed
but
better
coordinated
more
concise
and
more
dramatic
it
centers
around
the
brilliant
and
enigmatic
figure
of
the
true
hero
is
not
finally
the
king
himself
the
title
of
the
book
referring
to
the
soldiers
and
subjects
of
the
king
on
the
fatal
battlefield
of
to
quote
from
the
novel
the
wreath
he
twined
for
himself
slipped
down
upon
his
people
consists
not
of
a
connected
narrative
but
of
a
group
of
short
stories
each
depicting
a
special
phase
of
the
general
subject
uneven
in
interest
for
an
average
reader
eight
or
ten
of
these
are
among
the
finest
of
their
kind
in
literature
comprise
a
great
variety
of
scene
and
interest
grim
episodes
of
war
idyllic
interludes
superb
canvases
of
events
and
delightfully
humorous
sketches
of
odd
characters
general
effect
is
tragic
nothing
is
said
of
spectacular
victories
the
central
theme
being
the
heroic
loyalty
of
the
people
to
their
idolized
king
in
misfortune
and
defeat
carry
out
this
exalted
conception
the
author
has
combined
the
vivid
realism
and
imaginative
power
we
have
noticed
in
his
early
poetry
and
carried
them
out
on
a
grand
scale
peculiar
gift
as
had
been
suggested
before
is
his
intensity
has
said
that
fervor
is
the
core
of
style
few
authors
is
this
more
true
than
of
has
a
tremendous
range
of
characters
of
common
folk
even
more
than
of
major
figures
career
of
is
obviously
very
similar
to
that
of
ideal
was
of
as
was
purpose
however
was
not
to
establish
an
empire
but
to
assert
the
principle
of
divine
justice
aspired
to
be
a
god
in
human
form
but
with
each
it
was
a
different
kind
of
god
failed
catastrophically
in
an
invasion
of
and
each
brought
ruin
on
the
country
that
worshipped
him
is
still
glorified
as
a
national
hero
first
half
of
ending
on
the
climax
of
the
battle
of
in
is
more
dramatically
coherent
than
the
second
the
collapse
of
that
desperate
and
campaign
the
character
of
the
king
degenerated
for
a
time
into
a
futility
that
was
not
merely
pitiable
but
often
ridiculous
he
was
the
worst
of
losers
are
however
some
wonderful
chapters
at
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
concerning
the
reactions
of
the
in
adversity
more
than
ever
before
did
they
show
their
fortitude
and
patient
cheerfulness

out
in
which
describes
the
rallying
of
the
peasants
in
southern
to
repel
an
invasion

the
breaks

of
a
long
period
of
petulance
and
inertia
regains
his
old
self
escapes
from
and
finally
reaches
his
own
land
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
years
finds
it
in
utter
misery
and
desolation
his
people
ask
for
is
no
more
war
he
plunges
into
yet
another
this
time
with
and
is
killed
in
an
assault
on
the
fortress
of
being
only
years
of
age
when
he
died
had
become
king
at
fifteen
suddenly
there
was
a
tremendous
revulsion
of
popular
feeling
being
a
hated
tyrant
and
madman
he
was
now
the
symbol
of
all
that
was
noblest
and
best
in
the
history
of
is
brought
out
in
the
next
to
last
chapter
of
the
book
written
in
the
form
of
an
impassioned
prose
poem
the
procession
of
warriors
and
statesmen
passes
through
the
snow
beside
the
black
water
and
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
cathedral
the
shrine
of
so
many
precious
memories
guns
are
fired
the
hymns
are
sung
and
the
body
of
is
carried
down
to
the
vault
and
laid
beside
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
he
had
longed
to
be
he
became
the
echo
of
a
saga
wrote
four
other
works
of
fiction
about
earlier
figures
revered
in
memory
in
their
way
they
lack
the
wide
appeal
of
and
need
not
detain
us
here
is
different
with
his
volume
och
deras
a
history
intended
for
the
general
reader
and
particularly
suited
for
high
school
students
written
it
is
a
perfect
introduction
to
history
for
readers
of
other
countries
of
the
earlier
episodes
have
touches
of
the
supernatural
as
suited
to
the
legendary
background
are
suggestive
of
touching
is
the
chapter
about
a
daughter
who
became
a
nun
in
the
convent
of
record
teems
with
romance
and
adventure
is
a
superb
example
and
the
conqueror
of
hardly
less
so
and
it
is
unnecessary
to
speak
the
private
detective
will
also
investigate
insurance
claims
or
handle
divorce
cases
but
his
primary
function
remains
what
it
has
always
been
to
assist
those
who
have
money
in
their
unending
struggle
with
those
who
have
not
is
from
this
unpromising
background
that
the
fictional
private
detective
was
recruited
mythological
private
eye
differs
from
his
counterpart
in
real
life
in
two
essential
ways
the
one
hand
he
does
not
work
for
a
large
agency
but
is
almost
always
a
investigator
the
fictional
detective
is
responsible
to
no
one
but
himself
and
his
client
this
reason
he
appears
as
an
independent
and
figure
whose
rugged
individualism
need
not
be
pressed
into
the
mold
of
a
to
routine
the
other
hand
the
fictional
detective
does
not
break
strikes
or
handle
divorce
cases
no
client
would
ever
think
of
asking
him
to
do
such
things
his
original
assignment
the
fictional
private
eye
ends
up
by
investigating
and
solving
a
crime
usually
a
murder
as
a
one
man
police
force
in
fact
if
not
in
name
he
is
at
once
more
independent
and
more
dedicated
than
the
police
themselves
catches
criminals
not
merely
because
he
is
paid
to
do
so
frequently
he
does
not
receive
a
fee
at
all
but
because
he
enjoys
his
work
because
he
firmly
believes
that
murder
must
be
punished
the
fictional
detective
is
much
more
than
a
simple
businessman
is
first
and
foremost
a
defender
of
public
morals
a
servant
of
society
is
this
curious
blend
of
rugged
individualism
and
public
service
which
accounts
for
the
great
appeal
of
the
mythological
detective
virtue
of
his
his
individualism
and
his
freedom
from
external
restraint
the
private
eye
is
a
perfect
embodiment
of
the
middle
class
conception
of
liberty
which
amounts
to
doing
what
you
please
and
let
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
the
same
time
because
the
personal
code
of
the
detective
coincides
with
the
legal
dictates
of
his
society
because
he
likes
to
catch
criminals
he
is
in
middle
class
eyes
a
virtuous
man
this
way
the
private
detective
gets
the
best
of
two
possible
worlds
is
an
individualist
but
not
an
anarchist
he
is
a
public
servant
but
not
a
cop
short
the
fictional
private
eye
is
a
specialized
version
of
ideal
entrepreneur
the
man
whose
private
ambitions
must
always
and
everywhere
promote
the
public
welfare
the
mystery
story
as
in
of
individualism
and
the
social
good
are
two
sides
of
the
same
benevolent
coin
is
only
one
catch
to
this
idyllic
arrangement
was
wrong
only
did
the
ideal
entrepreneur
not
produce
the
greatest
good
for
the
greatest
number
he
ended
by
destroying
himself
by
giving
birth
to
monopoly
capitalism
rise
of
the
giant
corporations
in
and
the
dates
from
the
period
although
the
roots
of
the
mystery
story
in
serious
literature
go
back
as
far
as
and
it
was
not
until
the
closing
decades
of
the
century
that
the
private
detective
became
an
established
figure
in
popular
fiction
the
ancestor
of
all
private
eyes
was
born
during
the
the
transformation
of
ideal
entrepreneur
into
a
mythological
detective
coincides
closely
with
the
decline
of
the
real
entrepreneur
in
economic
life
from
the
marketplace
by
the
course
of
history
our
hero
disguises
himself
as
a
private
detective
birth
of
the
myth
compensates
for
the
death
of
the
ideal
on
the
fictional
level
however
the
contradictions
which
give
rise
to
the
mystery
story
are
not
fully
resolved
individualism
and
public
service
of
the
private
detective
both
stem
from
his
dedication
to
a
personal
code
of
conduct
he

told
to
do
so
private
eye
is
therefore
a
moral
man
but
his
morality
rests
upon
that
of
his
society
basic
premise
of
all
mystery
stories
is
that
the
distinction
between
good
and
bad
coincides
with
the
distinction
between
legal
and
illegal
this
assumption
does
not
always
hold
good
capitalism
in
the
century
has
become
increasingly
dependent
upon
force
and
violence
for
its
survival
the
private
detective
is
placed
in
a
serious
dilemma
he
is
good
he
may
not
be
legal
if
he
is
legal
he
may
not
be
good
is
the
gradual
unfolding
and
deepening
of
this
contradiction
which
creates
the
inner
dialectic
of
the
evolution
of
the
mystery
story
the
advent
of
the

of
the
modern
private
detective
begins
is
not
merely
an
individualist
he
is
very
close
to
being
a
mental

with
ample
food
for
thought

addicted
to
the
use
of

and
other

he
is
prone
to
trances
induced
by
the
playing
of
the
vioiln
he
is
a
recluse
an
incredible
egotist
a
confirmed
misogynist
rebels
against
the
social
conventions
of
his
day
not
on
moral
but
rather
on
aesthetic
grounds
eccentricity
begins
as
a
defense
against
boredom
was
in
order
to
avoid
the
stuffy
routine
of
middle
class
life
that
became
a
detective
in
the

he
informs

spent
in
one
long
effort
to
escape
from
the
commonplaces
of

little

help
me
to
do
so
is
a
public
servant
to
be
sure
but
the
society
which
he
serves
bores
him
to
tears
curious
relationship
between
and
provides
an
important
clue
to
the
deeper
significance
of
his
eccentric
behavior
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
cooperate
with
has
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
intelligence
and
mentality
of
the
police
for
their
part
are
convinced
that
is
too
unorthodox
and
theoretical
to
make
a
good
detective
do
the
police
find
unorthodox
the
face
of
it
it
is
because
he
employs
deductive
techniques
alien
to
official
police
routine
more
interesting
explanation
is
hinted
at
by
when
he
observes
on
several
occasions
that
would
have
made
a
magnificent
criminal
great
detective
modestly
agrees
insight
is
verified
by
the
mysterious
link
between
and
his
two
men

each

in
their
cunning
their
egotism
their
relentlessness

to
have

in
this
fatal
embrace

even
in
death
represents
the
of
the
great
detective
the
image
of
what
our
hero
might
have
become
were
he
not
a
public
servant
as
the
eccentric
stands
behind
the
detective
so
the
potential
criminal
lurks
behind
both
the
modern
whodunnit
this
insinuation
of
latent
criminality
in
the
detective
himself
has
almost
entirely
disappeared
and
the
respective
creations
of
and
have
retained
egotism
but
not
his
zest
for
life
and
eccentric
habits
and
his
counterparts
are
perfectly
respectable
people
it
is
true
that
they
are
also
extremely
dull
dedication
to
the
status
quo
has
been
affirmed
at
the
expense
of
the
fascinating
but
dangerous
individualism
of
a
real
descendents
were
unable
to
take
root
in
they
fled
from
the
parlor
and
made
their
way
across
the
stormy
the
hardboiled
detective
story
of
the
and
the
spirit
of
the
mad
genius
from
lives
on
the
private
eye
rejects
the
social
conventions
of
his
time
unlike
he
feels
his
society
to
be
not
merely
dull
but
also
corrupt
by
crime
and
violence
everywhere
the
hardboiled
private
eye
can
retain
his
purity
only
through
a
life
of
isolation
alienation
is
far
more
acute
than
he
is
not
an
eccentric
but
rather
an
outcast
alienation
is
represented
on
a
purely
physical
plane
refuses
to
ever
leave
his
own
house
and
spends
most
of
his
time
drinking
beer
and
playing
with
orchids
profound
and
more
disturbing
however
is
the
moral
isolation
of
a
society
where
everything
is
for
sale
is
the
only
man
who
cannot
be
bought
tough
honesty
condemns
him
to
a
solitary
and
difficult
existence
bruised
and
exhausted
he
pursues
the
elusive
killer
through
the
of
high
society
and
low
morals
always
alone
always
despised
the
end
he
gets
his
man
but
no
one
seems
to
care
virtue
is
its
own
and
only
reward
similar
tone
of
underlying
futility
and
despair
pervades
the
spy
thrillers
of
and
dominates
the
most
famous
of
all
mystery
stories
joins
forces
with
a
band
of
adventurers
in
search
of
a
priceless
jeweled
statue
of
a
falcon
but
when
the
bird
is
found
at
last
it
turns
out
to
be
a
fake
the
detective
must
save
his
own
skin
by
informing
on
the
girl
he
loves
who
is
also
the
real
murderer
neither
crime
nor
virtue
pays
moreover
it
is
increasingly
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
two
the
private
eye
intends
to
save
society
in
spite
of
himself
he
invariably
finds
himself
in
trouble
with
the
police
latter
are
either
too
stupid
to
catch
the
killer
or
too
corrupt
to
care
either
case
they
do
not
appreciate
the
private
zeal
and
and
spend
more
time
fighting
each
other
than
they
do
in
looking
for
the
criminal
enough
the
police
are
themselves
in
league
with
the
killer
provides
a
classic
example
of
this
theme
even
when
the
police
are
honest
they
do
not
trust
the
private
eye
is
like
too
alienated
to
be
reliable
in
among
others
the
clash
between
detective
and
police
is
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
becomes
the
chief
murder
suspect
order
to
exonerate
himself
he
is
compelled
to
find
the
real
criminal
who
happens
to
be
his
girl
friend
was
only
a
vague
suspicion
in
the
case
of
now
appears
as
a
direct
accusation
the
private
eye
is
in
danger
of
turning
into
his
opposite
is
the
growing
contradiction
between
individualism
and
public
service
in
the
mystery
story
which
creates
this
fatal
dilemma
upholding
his
own
personal
code
of
behavior
the
private
detective
has
placed
himself
in
opposition
to
a
society
whose
fabric
is
permeated
with
crime
and
corruption
society
responds
by
condemning
the
private
eye
as
a
threat
to
the
status
quo
a
potential
criminal
the
detective
insists
upon
retaining
his
personal
standards
he
must
now
do
so
in
conscious
defiance
of
his
society
must
in
short
cease
to
be
a
detective
and
become
a
rebel
the
other
hand
if
he
wishes
to
continue
in
his
chosen
profession
he
must
abandon
his
own
code
and
sacrifice
his
precious
individualism
resolved
this
contradiction
by
ceasing
to
write
mystery
stories
and
turning
to
other
pursuits
successors
have
adopted
the
opposite
alternative
order
to
save
the
mystery
story
they
have
converted
the
private
detective
into
an
organization
man
first
of
two
possible
variations
on
this
theme
is
symbolized
by
first
glance
this
hero
seems
to
be
more
rather
than
less
of
an
individualist
than
any
of
his
predecessors
nothing
is
forbidden
kills
when
he
pleases
takes
his
women
where
he
finds
them
and
always
acts
as
judge
jury
and
executioner
rolled
into
one
will
be
shown
that
the
objectives
of
the
cooperative
people
in
an
organization
determine
the
type
of
network
required
because
the
type
of
network
functions
according
to
the
characteristics
of
the
messages
enumerated
in
stress
is
placed
on
the
role
that
the
monitoring
of
information
sending
plays
in
maintaining
the
effectiveness
of
the
network
monitoring
we
mean
some
system
of
control
over
the
types
of
information
sent
from
the
various
centers
a
word
of
caution
we
should
be
aware
that
in
actual
practice
no
message
is
purely
one
of
the
four
types
question
command
statement
or
exclamation
example
suppose
a
man
wearing
a
watch
driving
a
stops
to
ask
a
man
on
the
sidewalk
time
is
it
sentence
would
have
most
of
the
characteristics
of
a
question
but
it
has
some
of
the
characteristics
of
a
statement
because
the
questioner
has
conveyed
the
fact
that
he
has
no
faith
in
his
own
timepiece
or
the
one
attached
to
his
car
the
man
on
the
sidewalk
is
surprised
at
this
question
it
has
served
as
an
exclamation
since
the
man
questioned
feels
a
strong
compulsion
to
answer
and
thereby
avoid
the
consequences
of
being
thought
queer
the
question
has
assumed
some
measurable
properties
of
a
command
for
convenience
we
will
stick
to
the
idea
that
information
can
be
classified
according
to
this
basis
certain
extreme
kinds
of
networks
will
be
discussed
for
illustrative
purposes
illustrating
some
special
types
of
organization
the
cocktail
party
a
cocktail
party
is
expected
to
fulfill
the
desire
to
get
together
a
number
of
people
who
are
inadequately
acquainted
and
thereby
arrange
for
bringing
the
level
of
acquaintance
up
to
adequacy
for
future
cooperative
endeavors
party
is
usually
in
a
room
small
enough
so
that
all
guests
are
within
sight
and
hearing
of
one
another
information
is
furnished
by
each
of
the
guests
is
sent
by
oral
broadcasting
over
the
air
waves
and
is
received
by
the
ears
the
air
is
a
continuum
the
network
of
communication
remains
intact
regardless
of
the
positions
or
motions
of
the
points
the
people
in
the
net
shown
in
there
is
a
connection
for
communication
between
every
pair
of
points
and
other
qualifications
make
the
cocktail
party
the
most
complete
and
most
chaotic
communication
system
ever
dreamed
up
four
types
of
message
listed
in
are
permitted
although
decorum
and
cocktail
tradition
require
holding
the
commands
to
a
minimum
while
exclamations
having
complimentary
intonations
are
more
than
customarily
encouraged
completeness
of
the
connections
provide
that
for
people
there
are
lines
of
communication
between
the
pairs
which
can
become
a
large
number
for
a
party
of
fifty
guests
at
the
diagram
we
see
that
connection
lines
come
in
to
each
member
the
cocktail
party
would
appear
to
be
the
ideal
system
but
there
is
one
weakness
spite
of
the
dreams
of
the
host
for
oneness
in
the
group
the
incoming
messages
for
each
guest
overload
his
receiving
system
beyond
comprehension
if
exceeds
about
six
crowd
consequently
breaks
up
into
temporary
groups
ranging
in
size
from
two
to
six
with
a
for
the
cluster
ranging
from
three
to
twenty
minutes
the
occasion
on
which
everyone
already
knows
everyone
else
and
the
host
wishes
them
to
meet
one
or
a
few
honored
newcomers
then
the
open
house
system
is
advantageous
because
the
honored
guests
are
fixed
connective
points
and
the
drifting
guests
make
and
break
connections
at
the
door
rural
community
consider
a
rural
community
as
an
assemblage
of
inhabited
dwellings
whose
configuration
is
determined
by
the
location
and
size
of
the
arable
land
sites
necessary
for
family
subsistence
assume
for
this
illustration
that
the
size
of
the
land
plots
is
so
great
that
the
distance
between
dwellings
is
greater
than
the
voice
can
carry
and
that
most
of
the
communication
is
between
nearest
neighbors
only
as
shown
in
beyond
nearest
neighbor
is
carried
and
as
a
distortable
rumor
the
points
in
the
network
are
designated
by
a
letter
accompanied
by
a
number
numbers

the
number

neighbors
will
be
noted
that
point
f

seven
nearest

h

six
and
p
has
only

the
remaining

numbers
any
social
system
in
which
communications
have
an
importance
comparable
with
that

factors
a

other

the

his

the

the
one
with
the
greatest
difficulty
of
all
in
putting
over
an
idea
or
getting
people
to
join
him
in
a
cooperative
effort
the
hazards
of
poor
communication
are
so
great
p
can
be
justified
as
a
habitable
site
only
on
the
basis
of
unusual
productivity
such
as
is
made
available
by
a
waterfall
for
milling
purposes
a
mine
or
a
sugar
maple
camp
theorists
have
given
these
matters
much
consideration
organizations
networks
for
military
communications
are
one
of
the
best
examples
of
networks
which
not
only
must
be
changed
with
the
changes
in
objectives
but
also
must
be
changed
with
the
addition
of
new
machines
of
war
also
furnish
proof
that
in
modern
war
message
sending
must
be
monitored
monitoring
a
military
hookup
becomes
a
noisy
party
need
for
monitoring
became
greater
when
radio
was
adopted
for
military
signaling
the
who
used
runners
as
message
carriers
did
not
have
to
worry
about
having
every
officer
in
his
command
hear
what
he
said
and
having
hundreds
of
them
comment
at
once
time
has
passed
and
science
has
progressed
the
speed
of
military
vehicles
has
increased
the
range
of
missiles
has
been
extended
the
use
of
noses
on
the
projectiles
has
been
adopted
and
the
range
and
breadth
of
message
sending
has
increased
to
the
old
problem
of
the
slowness
of
decision
making
network
structure
seems
to
be
paramount
and
without
monitoring
no
network
has
value
the
parade
ground
the
net
may
be
similar
to
that
shown
in
monitoring
is
the
highest
and
most
restrictive
of
any
organization
in
existence
questions
statements
or
explanations
are
permitted
only
commands
go
only
from
an
officer
to
the
man
of
nearest
lower
rank
same
command
is
repeated
as
many
times
as
there
are
levels
in
rank
from
general
to
corporal
orders
originate
with
the
officer
of
highest
rank
and
terminate
with
action
of
the
men
in
the
ranks
the
officer
in
charge
be
it
a
captain
for
small
display
or
a
general
is
restrained
by
monitoring
is
done
for
simplicity
of
commands
and
to
bring
the
hidden
redundancy
up
to
where
misunderstanding
has
almost
zero
possibility
commands
are
specified
by
the
military
regulations
are
few
in
number
briefly
worded
all
different
in
sound
and
are
combinable
into
sequences
which
permit
any
marching
maneuver
that
could
be
desired
on
a
parade
ground
monitoring
is
necessary
because
on
a
parade
ground
everyone
can
hear
too
much
and
without
monitoring
a
confused
social
event
would
develop
troops
dispersed
on
fields
of
battle
rather
than
on
the
parade
ground
it
may
seem
that
a
certain
amount
of
monitoring
is
automatically
enforced
by
the
lines
of
communication
ago
this
was
true
but
with
the
replacement
of
wires
or
runners
by
radio
and
radar
and
perhaps
television
these
restrictions
have
disappeared
and
now
again
too
much
is
heard
contrast
to
cocktail
parties
military
organizations
even
in
the
field
are
more
formal
the
extreme
and
oversimplified
example
suggested
in
the
organization
is
more
easily
understood
and
more
predictable
in
behavior
military
organization
has
an
objective
chosen
by
the
higher
command
objective
is
adhered
to
throughout
the
duration
of
the
action
connective
system
or
network
is
tailored
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
objective
and
it
is
therefore
not
surprising
that
a
military
body
acting
as
a
single
coordinated
unit
has
a
different
communication
network
than
a
factory
a
college
or
a
rural
village
assumptions
upon
which
the
example
shown
in
is
based
are
man
can
direct
about
six
subordinates
if
the
subordinates
are
chosen
carefully
so
that
they
do
not
need
too
much
personal
coaching
indoctrinating
message
runs
too
great
a
risk
of
being
distorted
if
it
is
to
be
relayed
more
than
about
six
consecutive
times
of
a
general
kind
are
made
by
the
central
command
all
action
of
a
physical
kind
pertinent
to
the
mission
is
relegated
to
the
line
of
men
on
the
lower
rank
assumptions
lead
to
an
organization
with
one
man
at
the
top
six
directly
under
him
six
under
each
of
these
and
so
on
until
there
are
six
levels
of
personnel
number
of
people
acting
as
one
body
by
this
scheme
gives
a
surprisingly
large
army
of
men
organizational
network
would
be
of
no
avail
if
there
were
no
regulations
pertaining
to
the
types
of
message
sent
types
of
message
listed
in
commands
and
statements
are
the
only
ones
sent
through
the
vertical
network
shown
in
further
regulation
is
that
commands
always
go
down
unaccompanied
by
statements
and
statements
always
go
up

readily
be

that
in

not

different
from
some
of
the

today
greater
emphasis

other

are
some
military
problems
of
modern
times
such
as

where
the

all
so
inadequate

problems
are
of
extreme
interest
as
well
as
importance
and
are
so
much
like
fighting
in
a
rain
forest
or
guerrilla
warfare
at
night
in
tall
grass
that
we
might
have
to
primitive
conflicts
for
what
they
could
teach
team
for
useful
research
is
an
unsolved
problem
which
probably
has
never
been
seriously
investigated
although
one
frequently
hears
the
comment
that
we
have
insufficient
specialists
of
the
kind
who
can
compete
with
the
or
for
example
in
precision
machinery
and
mathematics
or
the
in
geochemistry
hear
equally
fervent
concern
over
the
belief
that
we
have
not
enough
generalists
who
can
see
the
picture
and
combine
our
national
skills
and
knowledge
for
useful
purposes
problem
of
the
optimum
balance
in
the
relative
numbers
of
generalists
and
specialists
can
be
investigated
on
a
communicative
network
basis
the
difficulty
of
drawing
the
net
is
great
we
will
merely
discuss
it
we
realize
that
a
pure
specialist
does
not
exist
for
practical
purposes
we
have
people
who
can
be
considered
as
such
example
there
are
persons
who
are
in
physical
science
in
the
field
of
mineralogy
trained
in
crystallography
who
use
only
applying
only
the
powder
technique
of
diffraction
to
clay
minerals
only
and
who
have
spent
the
last
fifteen
years
concentrating
on
the
montmorillonites
or
persons
in
the
social
sciences
in
the
field
of
anthropology
studying
the
lung
capacity
of
seven
we
see
that
a
specialist
is
a
man
who
knows
more
and
more
about
less
and
less
as
he
develops
as
contrasted
to
the
generalist
who
knows
less
and
less
about
more
and
more
democratic
thought
pointed
up
the
relation
between
the
movement
in
this
country
and
the
development
of
a
social
religion
which
he
called
the
familiar
with
his
work
will
remember
that
he
placed
the
incipience
of
the
democratic
faith
at
around
he
describes
it
as
a
balanced
polarity
between
the
notions
of
the
free
individual
and
what
he
called
the
fundamental
law
want
to
say
more
about
fundamental
law
first
want
to
quote
him
on
the
relationship
that
he
found
between
religion
and
politics
in
this
country
and
what
happened
to
it
points
out
that
from
the
time
of
on
through
evangelical
was
a
dominant
influence
in
the
social
and
political
life
of
terms
this
early
enthusiasm
and
concludes
that
its
similarity
to
democratic
beliefs
of
that
day
is
so
great
that
the
doctrine
of
liberty
seems
but
a
secular
version
of
its
counterpart
in
evangelical
me
quote
him
even
more
fully
for
his
analysis
is
important
to
my
theme
says
beside
the
philosophy
of
as
expressed
in
radical
or
conservative
millenarianism
should
be
placed
the
doctrine
of
the
democratic
faith
which
affirmed
it
to
be
the
duty
of
the
destiny
of
the
to
assist
in
the
creation
of
a
better
world
by
keeping
lighted
the
beacon
of
democracy
specifies
in
the
middle
period
of
the
it
was
colored
by
supernaturalism
in
the
it
was
affected
by
naturalism
in
every
period
it
has
been
humanism
let
me
add
utopianism
also
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
in
an
essay
called
used
his
polarity
to
illustrate
what
thought
had
happened
to
us
in
that
form
of
liberalism
we
call
seemed
to
me
that
the
liberals
had
scrapped
the
balanced
polarity
and
reposed
both
liberty
and
the
fundamental
law
in
the
common
man
is
to
say
fundamental
law
had
been
so
much
modified
by
this
time
that
it
was
neither
fundamental
nor
law
any
more
is
a
weakness
of
analysis
that
he
never
seems
to
realize
that
his
fundamental
law
had
already
been
cut
loose
from
its
foundations
when
it
was
adapted
to
democracy
with
the
of
was
replacing
what
called
supernaturalism
the
common
man
was
developing
mythic
power
or
charisma
on
his
own
the
decade
that
followed
the
common
man
as
that
piece
put
it
grew
uncomfortable
as
the
of
and
fled
from
behind
only
to
learn
from
to
his
shocked
relief
that
after
all
there
was
no
he
had
to
speak
for
and
that
he
was
just
an
animal
anyhow
that
there
was
a
chemical
formula
for
him
and
that
too
much
be
expected
of
him
socialism
implicit
in
the
slogan
of
the
freedom
from
want
and
fear
seems
a
far
cry
from
the
individualism
of
the

the

of
the

this

understanding

position
that
doctrinaire
liberals
found
themselves
in
after

our
great
democratic
victory
that
brought
no

that

of

as
the
revolutionary
experiment
in
radical
socialism
the
ultimate
exemplar
by
the
time
the
war
ended
liberal
leadership
in
this
country
was
spiritually
will
recall
that
the
still
confident
liberals
of
the
administration
gathered
with
other
utopians
in
to
set
up
the
legal
framework
finally
and
at

to
rationalize

to
rationalize
want
and
fear
out
of

the
of
the
world
got
all
set
for

and
rehabilitation
suddenly
we
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
of
another
fight
an
irrational
an
indecent
an
undeclared
and
immoral
war
with
our
strongest
and
some
had
thought

ally

next
five

negative
policy

the
bitterest
irony
enforced
and
enforceable
only
by
threat
of
a

that
we
felt
the
greatest
distaste
for
but
could
not
abandon
the
atom
bomb
it
will
be
remembered
the
without
positive
program
campaigned
on
the
popular
disillusionment
with
liberal
leadership
and
won
overwhelmingly
of
this
know
is
recent
history
familiar
to
you
have
been
at
some
pains
to
review
it
as
the
drama
of
the
common
man
to
point
up
what
happened
to
him
under
leadership
perceptive
journalist
has
phrased
it
in
the
title
of
one
of
his
books
as
the
revolt
of
the
moderates
opens
his
discourse
however
with
a
review
of
the
inaugural
festivities
at
which
a
sympathetic
press
had
assembled
its
massive
talents
all
primed
to
catch
some
revelation
of
the
emerging
new
age
show
was
colorful
indeed
exuberant
but
the
press
for
all
its
assiduity
could
detect
no
note
of
a
fateful
rendezvous
with
destiny
offers
his
book
as
an
explanation
of
why
there
was
no
clue
select
this
sentence
as
its
pertinent
summation
in
essence
the
drama
of
his
can
be
described
as
the
ordeal
of
a
nation
turned
conservative
and
struggling
thus
far
with
but
limited
and
precarious
success
to
give
effective
voice
and
force
to
that
conservatism
will
assume
that
we
are
all
aware
of
the
continuing
struggle
with
its
limited
and
precarious
success
toward
conservatism
has
moved
on
various
levels
it
has
been
clamorous
and
confused
there
has
been
no
agreement
on
what
conservatism
is
or
rather
what
it
should
be
it
was
neglected
not
to
say
nascent
when
the
struggle
began
saw
a
piece
the
other
day
assailing
author
of
at
and
publisher
of
as
no
conservative
at
all
but
an
old
liberal
would
agree
with
this
view
not
here
to
define
conservatism
am
here
to
do
is
to
report
on
the
gyrations
of
the
struggle
a
struggle
that
amounts
to
to
see
if
we
can
predict
its
future
course
of
the
obvious
conclusions
we
can
make
on
the
basis
of
the
last
election
suppose
is
that
we
the
majority
were
dissatisfied
with
conservatism
to
be
sure
we
gave
no
very
positive
approval
in
the
margin
of
his
preferment
is
however
symptomatic
of
our
national
malaise
before
try
to
diagnose
it
would
offer
other
evidence
will
mention
two
volumes
of
specific
comment
on
this
malaise
that
appeared
last
year
earlier
of
them
was
an
unofficial
enterprise
sponsored
by
magazine
under
the
title
of
contributors
to
this
testament
were
all
a
former
candidate
for
a
poet
the
chief
editorial
writer
two
newspaper
columnists
head
of
a
national
broadcasting
company
a
popular
evangelist
want
to
point
out
here
is
that
all
of
them
are
or
modified
liberals
with
perhaps
one
exception
suppose
we
might
classify
as
an
old
liberal
would
further
note
that
they
all
with
one
exception
again
sang
in
one
key
or
another
the
same
song
refrain
was
let
us
return
to
the
individualistic
democracy
of
our
forefathers
for
our
salvation
expressed
some
reservations
about
this
return
invoked
technology
and
common
sense
envisioned
the
possibility
of
our
having
outlived
most
of
what
we
used
to
regard
as
the
program
of
our
national
purposes
the
most
notable
thing
about
the
incantation
of
these
was
that
the
shibboleth
of
socialism
was
conspicuously
absent
second
specific
comment
was
the
report
of
on
titled
perhaps
gave
the
pitch
of
their
position
in
the
preface
where
it
was
said
that
requested
that
the
be
administered
by
the
of
because
it
was
seems
to
represent
the
viewpoint
of
what
would
call
the
unconscious
liberal
but
not
unconscious
enough
to
invoke
the
now
taboo
symbolism
of
socialism
here
again
we
hear
the
same
refrain
mentioned
above
the
paramount
goal
of
the
set
long
ago
was
to
guard
the
rights
of
the
individual
ensure
his
development
enlarge
his
opportunity
group
is
secularist
and
their
program
tends
to
be
technological
it
is
the
need
to
undertake
these
testaments
that
would
submit
here
as
symptom
of
the
common
malaise
let
me
add
new
book
as
another
symptom
of
it
particularly
so
in
view
of
the
attention
magazine
gave
it
when
it
came
out
recently
goes
back
to
the
of
too
though
may
add
with
considerably
more
historical
perception
will
reserve
discussion
of
it
for
a
moment
however
to
return
to
symptomatic
of
the
common
malaise
he
is
most
significant
a
liberal
and
a
elected
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
that
not
suggest
to
you
an
uncertain
and
uneasy
not
to
say
confused
state
of
the
public
mind
is
the
common
complaint
take
a
panoramic
look
back
over
the
course
we
have
come
not
that
way
been
lit
always
by
the
lamp
of
liberalism
up
until
the
turning
back
under
the
basic
character
of
that
liberalism
has
been
spiritual
rather
than
economic
gave
it
the
name
of
philosophy
of
a
subjective
side
to
that
utopian
outlook
our
society
have
a
runaway
uncontrollable
growth
of
technology
which
may
end
our
civilization
or
a
normal
healthy
growth
there
may
be
an
analogy
with
cancer
we
can
detect
cancers
by
their
rapidly
accelerating
growth
determinable
only
when
related
to
the
more
normal
rate
of
healthy
growth
the
accelerating
growth
of
technology
then
warn
us
such
evidence
is
the
first
step
and
almost
the
only
cure
is
early
detection
and
removal
way
to
determine
whether
we
have
so
dangerous
a
technology
would
be
to
check
the
strength
of
our
organs
to
see
if
their
functioning
is
as
healthy
as
before
an
objective
look
at
our
present
procedures
may
move
us
to
consider
seriously
this
possibly
analogous
situation
any
event
whether
society
may
have
cancer
or
merely
a
virus
infection
the
disease
we
shall
find
is
political
economical
social
and
even
medical
not
our
physical
abilities
already
deteriorated
because
of
the
more
sedentary
lives
we
are
now
living
the
prime
issue
as
see
it
is
whether
a
democratic
or
free
society
can
master
technology
for
the
benefit
of
mankind
or
whether
technology
will
rule
and
develop
its
own
society
compatible
with
its
own
needs
as
a
force
of
nature

already
committed
to
establishing
supremacy
over
nature
and
everywhere
on

not
merely
in
the
limited
context

are
fond
of
today

go

draw
the
line

able

that
to
contend
we
cannot
realize
a
universal
goal
in
the
immediate
future
is
to
be
extremely
shortsighted
if
nothing
else
must
believe
we
have
the
ability
to
affect
our
own
destinies
otherwise
why

will
cover
up
the
sordid
facts
we
want
respect
from
ourselves
or
others
we
will
have
to
earn
it
let
us
realize
that
whatever
good
this
achieved
in
earlier
times
now
the
corporation
per
se
cannot
take
economic
leadership
must
develop
as
a
result
of
the
ideas
energies
and
ambitions
of
an
individual
having
purpose
and
comprehensive
ability
within
one
mind
we
forced
individuals
to
assume
the
corporate
structure
by
means
of
taxes
and
other
legal
statutes
we
adopted
what
would
term
and
so
took
a
major
step
toward
socialism
biggest
loss
of
course
was
the
lessened
desire
and
ability
to
give
his
services
to
the
growth
of
his
company
and
our
economy
grant
has
a
definite
place
in
our
society
let
us
not
complain
of
the
evils
of
capitalism
by
referring
to
a
form
that
is
not
truly
capitalistic
forms
of
capitalism
do
indeed
work
superb
organizations
a
credit
to
any
society
the
which
dictates
our
whole
economy
as
well
as
our
politics
and
social
life
will
not
stand
close
scrutiny
pretense
to
operate
in
the
public
interest
is
little
more
than
a
sham
serves
only
its
own
stockholders
and
poorly
at
that
a
creative
enterprise
its
abilities
are
primarily
in
swallowing
creative
enterprises
developed
outside
its
own
organization
an
ability
made
possible
by
us
and
almost
mandatory
to
benefits
to
employees
it
is
notorious
for
its
callous
disregard
except
where
it
depends
on
them
for
services
corporation
in
is
in
reality
our
form
of
socialism
vying
in
a
sense
with
the
other
socialistic
form
that
has
emerged
within
governmental
bureaucracy
while
the
corporation
has
all
the
disadvantages
of
the
socialist
form
of
organization
so
cumbersome
it
cannot
constructively
do
much
of
anything
not
compatible
with
its
need
to
perpetuate
itself
and
maintain
its
status
quo
unluckily
it
does
not
have
the
desirable
aspect
of
socialism
the
motivation
to
operate
for
the
benefit
of
society
as
a
whole
we
are
faced
with
a
vast
network
of
amorphous
entities
perpetuating
themselves
in
whatever
manner
they
can
without
regard
to
the
needs
of
society
controlling
society
and
forcing
upon
it
a
regime
representing
only
the
needs
for
survival
corporation
has
a
limited
specific
place
in
our
society
speaking
it
should
be
allowed
to
operate
only
where
the
public
has
a
great
stake
in
the
continuity
of
supply
or
services
and
where
the
actions
of
a
single
proprietor
are
secondary
to
the
needs
of
society
are
in
public
utilities
making
military
aircraft
and
accessories
or
where
the
investment
and
risk
for
a
proprietorship
would
be
too
great
for
a
much
needed
project
impossible
to
achieve
by
any
means
other
than
the
corporate
form
constructing
major
airports
or
dams
if
corporations
are
not
to
run
away
with
us
they
must
become
institutions
subject
to
public
control
and
needs
all
other
areas
private
initiative
of
the
proprietorship
type
should
be
urged
to
produce
the
desired
goods
and
services
runaway
technology
can
be
done
only
by
assuring
a
humane
society
and
for
this
human
beings
must
be
firmly
in
control
of
the
economics
on
which
our
society
rests
genuine
human
leadership
the
proprietorship
can
offer
corporations
cannot
can
project

react
violently
to

quarterly

apt
by
nature
to
be
impersonal
inhumane
shortsighted
and
almost
exclusively
a

they
could
scarcely
afford

the

proprietor
is
able
to
create
a
leadership
impossible
in
the
corporate
structure
with
its
board
of
directors

is
lacking
in
our

because
it

no
legitimate
place
to

continuously
at
the

of

can
acquire
experiences
of
the
most
varied

type
so
that
at
maturation
they
have
developed
the
competence
and
willingness
to
accept
the
personal
responsibility
so
sorely
needed
now
government
must
establish
greater
controls
upon

so
that
their

promote
what
is
deemed
essential
to
the
national
interest
should
get
the
tax
advantages
now
accruing
to

the
chance
to
accumulate

so
vital
for

should
pay
added
taxes
to
be
used
for
educational
purposes
not
necessarily
of

control

those
with

is
basically
the

the
establishment
should
become
a
corporation
until
it
is
either
acquired
by
another
proprietor
or
the
government
decides
to
drop
it
should
be
declared
illegal
against
corporations
because
disagreements
would
have
to
be
settled
by
government
representatives
acting
as
controllers
of
the
corporation
whose
responsibility
to
the
state
would
now
be
defined
against
proprietorship
because
employees
and
proprietors
must
be
completely
interdependent
as
they
are
each
a
part
of
the
whole
threatening
the
security
of
the

if
internally
motivated
prevent
a
healthy

external
forces
should
not
be
applied
arbitrarily
out
of
mere
power
available
to
do
so
we
cannot
stop
warfare
in
our

economic
system
how
can
we
expect

internationally
kind

with

that

is
testimony
to
the
deep
respect
in
which
was
held
by
members
of
all
parties
that
the
moral
considerations
raised
by
his
approach
to
the
matter
were
not
explicitly
to
be
broached
began
to
be
apparent
in
a
press
conference
held
during
the
second
illness
in
order
that
the
consulting
specialists
might
clarify
the
condition
for
the
nation
if
felt
impelled
thereafter
to
formulate
the
ethics
of
the
medical
profession
his
article
in
the
accomplished
a
good
deal
more
forced
us
to
fix
the
responsibility
for
the
position
in
which
all
medical
commentators
had
been
placed
discussion
of
professional
ethics
inevitably
reminded
us
that
in
the
historical
perspective
the
decision
will
finally
clarify
itself
as
a
moral
rather
than
a
medical
problem
the
responsibility
for
resolving
the
issue
lay
with
the
rather
than
with
his
doctors
nothing
raises
more
surely
for
us
the
difficulties
simple
goodness
faces
in
dealing
with
complex
moral
problems
under
political
pressure
the
had
dealt
with
the
matter
humbly
in
what
he
conceived
as
the
democratic
way
the
problem
is
one
which
gives
us
the
measure
of
a
man
rather
than
a
group
of
men
whether
a
group
of
doctors
a
group
of
party
members
assembled
at
a
dinner
to
give
their
opinion
or
the
masses
of
the
voters
attempt
to
reconcile
this
statement
of
the
central
issue
in
the
campaign
of
with
the
nature
of
the
man
who
could
not
conceive
it
as
the
central
issue
will
at
least
resolve
our
confusions
about
the
chaotic
and
misleading
results
of
the
earnestness
of
both
doctors
and
in
a
situation
which
should
never
have
arisen
was
a
response
to
the
conflict
between
political
pressure
and
the
moral
intuition
which
resulted
in
attempts
at
prediction
no
other
situation
would
a
group
of
doctors
struggling
competently
to
improve
the
life
expectancy
of
a
man
beloved
by
the
world
be
subjected
to
such
merciless
and
persistent
questioning
and
before
they
were
prepared
to
demonstrate
the
kind
of
verbal
precision
which
alone
can
clarify
for
mankind
the
problems
it
faces
though
we
can
look
back
now
and
see
their
errors
we
can
look
back
also
to
the
ultimate
error
recurred
in
the
press
conferences
the
remarks
about
his
running
developed
a
singular
tone
one
which
we
find
in
few
statements
made
by
public
individuals
on
such
a
matter
press
conference
became
a
stage
which
betrayed
the
drift
of
his
private
thinking
rather
than
his
convictions
commented
thoughtfully
a
reporter
told
us
that
it
was
not
too
important
for
the
individual
how
he
ends
up
gave
us
a
simile
to
explain
his
admission
that
even
at
the
worst
period
of
his
second
illness
it
never
occurred
to
him
there
was
any
renewed
question
about
his
running
as
in
the
of
the
he
had
no
fears
about
the
outcome
until
he
read
the
newspapers
the
attitude
that
the
fate
of
the
demands
in
such
a
situation
is
quite
distinct
from
the
simple
courage
that
can
proceed
with
battles
to
be
fought
regardless
of
the
consequences
this
case
others
should
not
have
had
to
raise
the
doubts
and
fears
demands
an
incisive
awareness
of
the
larger
implications
of
the
death
of
any
incumbent
is
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
people
of
and
of
the
world
how
their
governing
ends
up
during
the
four
years
of
his
term
when
that
term
is
ended
and
he
is
a
private
citizen
again
can
he
be
permitted
the
freedom
and
the
courage
to
discount
the
dangers
of
his
death
enough
in
this
instance
such
personal
virtues
were
a
luxury
the
national
and
international
level
then
what
is
the
highest
kind
of
morality
for
the
private
citizen
represents
an
instance
of
political
immorality
we
had
the
uneasy
sense
that
the
cleavage
between
the
moral
and
the
political
progressed
amid
the
events
which
concern
us
the
tone
of
the
editorials
which
greeted
original
announcement
of
his
running
had
been
strangely
disquieting
the
vibrant
enthusiasm
which
bespeaks
a
intuitive
sense
of
the
fitness
of
things
at
climactic
moments
nor
the
vital
argumentation
betraying
its
sense
that
something
significant
has
transpired
was
in
evidence
testifies
more
clearly
to
that
cleavage
than
the
peculiar
editorial
page
appearing
in
a
issue
of
the
issue
which
also
carried
the
second
announcement
of
the
candidacy
double
editorial
on
was
subtly
calculated
to
suggest
a
moral
sanction
for
gambles
great
as
well
as
small
reflecting
popular
approval
of
this
questionable
attitude
toward
the
highest
office
in
the
land
and
live
happily
together
if
we
do
not
examine
where
the
line
is
to
be
drawn
may
possibly
be
a
greater
risk
than
is
the
normal
person
of
my
age
the
had
said
on
of
the
election
year
ignoring
the
fact
that
no
one
of
his
age
had
ever
lived
out
another
term
doctors
assure
me
that
this
increased
percentage
of
risk
is
not
great
by
the
time
the
risk
was
doubled
events
had
dismissed
from
his
mind
both
increased
percentages
and
a
previously
stated
intention
of
considering
carefully
anything
more
serious
than
a
bout
of
influenza
infrequently
did
the
situation
color
his
thinking
no
president
we
have
had
would
have
regretted
more
than
the
possibility
to
which
his
own
words
in
the
press
conference
held
at
the
beginning
of
testified
that
unable
as
he
was
himself
to
say
his
running
was
best
for
the
country
unconsciously
he
had
placed
his
party
before
his
nation
it
is
that
we
relive
his
opening
statement
in
the
first
television
address
with
the
dramatic
immediacy
of
the
present
consideration
of
risk
urges
itself
upon
him
now
for
this
is
what
the
mind
does
with
the
ideas
on
which
it
has
not
properly
focussed
with
a
mind
less
shallow
if
less
sharp
than
some
of
the
syndicates
which
back
him
he
feels
what
he
cannot
formulate
and
we
watch
him
amid
the
overtones
which
suggest
he
could
never
in
any
conscience
urge
a
risk
upon
the
voters
as
he
is
into
the
phase
of
the
campaign
which
demands
conviction
of
him
he
adopts
a
position
that
is
morally
indefensible
ascribes
to
the
mercy
of
the
peace
which
this
personal
matter
the
assurance
that
he
can
physically
sustain
the
burden
of
the
office
longer
than
any
individual
in
the
history
of
our
nation
has
been
able
to
do
has
brought
him
is
simply
an
opinion
formed
in
defiance
of
the
laws
of
human
probability
whether
or
not
it
is
later
confirmed
has
become
by
of
the
election
year
a
firm
conviction
a
means
of
silencing
a
discussion
which
ought
to
have
taken
place
the
statement
is
an
effective
one
we
sympathize
with
the
universal
confusion
which
gives
rise
to
such
convictions
it
is
also
the
climax
to
one
of
the
absorbing
chapters
in
our
current
political
history
assigning
to
the
responsibility
which
he
learned
could
not
rest
with
his
doctors
gave
evidence
of
that
weakening
of
the
moral
intuition
which
was
to
characterize
his
administration
in
the
years
to
follow
any
other
man
this
reassurance
to
the
electorate
would
have
caused
us
a
profound
moral
shock
this
man
we
had
to
think
twice
knew
that
it
was
as
reassurance
the
ironic
fruit
of
a
deeply
moral
nature
the
fact
remains
that
even
the
unconscious
acceptance
of
himself
as
a
man
of
destiny
divinely
protected
must
be
censored
in
any
man
who
evades
the
responsibility
for
his
major
decisions
and
thus
for
imposing
his
will
on
the
people
in
the
context
of
drifting
personal
utterances
we
have
examined
there
was
occasional
evidence
of
the
origin
of
all
such
evasions
the
possibility
that
he
had
not
given
reconsideration
to
so
weighty
a
decision
seemed
to
disconcert
his
questioners
was
known
to
make
his
characteristic
statement
to
the
press
that
he
was
not
going
to
talk
about
the
matter
any
more
had
stopped
it
was
not
to
be
resumed
portrait
that
had
developed
fragmentarily
but
consistently
was
the
portrait
of
a
man
to
whom
serious
thinking
is
alien
enough
that
the
making
of
a
decision
inhibits
when
it
does
not
forestall
any
ability
to
review
the
decision
in
the
light
of
new
evidence
does
not
mean
that
the
decision
to
run
for
office
should
inevitably
have
been
revoked
it
means
that
the
thinking
in
which
decision
issues
has
the
power
to
determine
the
morality
of
the
decision
as
in
this
instance
the
pressure
for
renewed
practical
or
legislative
attention
to
the
constitutional
problems
the
decision
had
uncovered
might
have
done
through
a
third
illness
apparently
without
any
provision
for
the
handling
of
a
major
national
emergency
other
than
a
talk
with
the
revealed
the
singularly
static
quality
of
his
thinking
three
warnings
no
sense
of
moral
urgency
impelled
him
to
distinguish
his
situation
and
thus
his
responsibilities
from
contrast
the
energetic
reaction
of
the
leader
to
the
full
demands
his
decision
imposes
upon
him
strengthens
the
moral
intuition
and
gives
us
the
measure
of
the
man
by
means
of
an
intensive
preoccupation
with
the
detailed
considerations
following
from
any
decision
can
he
ensure
attention
to
the
practical
details
to
be
dealt
with
if
the
implications
of
immorality
in
the
major
decision
are
effectively
to
be
checked
the
incessant
struggle
with
recalcitrant
political
fact
he
learns
to
focus
the
essence
of
a
problem
in
the
significant
detail
and
to
articulate
the
distinctions
which
clarify
the
detail
as
significant
with
what
is
sometimes
astounding
rapidity
he
can
distinguish
his
relation
to
from
the
constitutional
responsibilities
a
questionable
decision
exacts
of
him
he
can
distinguish
an
attitude
toward
a
leader
he
may
share
with
a
host
of
from
the
responsibilities
diplomatic
convention
may
impose
upon
him
chooses
to
subordinate
one
to
the
other
sometimes
reluctantly
accepting
criticism
for
the
lesser
immoralities
facts
breed
very
nature
of
a
choice
so
grounded
in
distinction
and
fact
leads
to
the
valid
convictions
which
become
force
of
will
in
the
manifest
leader
capacity
for
making
the
distinctions
of
which
diplomacy
is
compact
and
the
facility
with
language
which
can
render
them
into
validity
in
the
eyes
of
other
men
are
the
means
for
transforming
the
moral
intuition
into
moral
leadership
making
of
distinctions
like
the
perception
of
the
great
distinctions
made
is
an
inordinately
difficult
business
slow
progress
towards
the
several
marking
his
achievement
is
even
now
unrecognizable
as
such
and
loosely
interpreted
as
the
alternation
of
inconsistency
with
vision
because
it
is
the
function
of
the
mind
to
turn
the
one
into
the
other
by
means
of
the
capacities
with
which
words
endow
it
we
do
not
unwisely
examine
the
type
of
distinction
in
the
sphere
of
politics
on
which
decisions
hang
recently
and
perhaps
because
a
television
debate
can
so
effectively
dramatize
extraordinary
mastery
of
detail
have
the
abilities
on
which
the
capacity
for
making
distinctions
depend
begun
to
be
clearly
discernible
at
the
level
of
politics
his
recent
evaluation
of
potentialities
for
leadership
has
cited
the
precision
of
his
mind
his
immense
command
of
factual
detail
and
his
instinct
for
the
crucial
point
as
impressive
in
the
extreme
and
it
is
surely
clear
that
the
first
of
these
is
the
result
of
the
way
in
which
the
command
of
language
interacts
with
the
other
two
this
change
is
not
a
change
from
one
positive
position
to
another
but
a
change
from
order
and
truth
to
disorder
and
negation
division
we
might
observe
in
passing
is
not
of
itself
directly
involved
in
a
private
interest
conflict
nor
even
in
struggle
between
ruling
groups
it
is
rooted
in
a
difference
of
response
to
the
threat
of
social
disintegration
division
is
not
between
those
who
wish
to
preserve
what
they
have
and
those
who
want
change
it
is
a
division
established
by
two
absolutely
different
ways
of
thought
with
regard
to
life
in
society
ways
are
absolutely
irreconcilable
because
they
offer
two
different
recipes
for
redemption
from
chaos
civilizational
crisis
the
third
type
of
change
raises
the
question
what
are
we
to
do
the
most
primitive
level
the
answer
cannot
be
derived
from
any
socially
cohesive
element
in
the
disrupting
community
is
no
socially
existential
answer
to
the
question
the
truth
formerly
experienced
by
the
community
no
longer
has
existential
status
in
the
community
nor
does
any
answer
elaborated
by
philosophers
or
theoriticians
this
phase
of
change
no
idea
has
social
acceptance
and
so
none
has
ontological
status
in
the
community
interregnum
ensues
in
which
not
men
but
ideas
compete
for
existence
we
examine
the
three
types
of
change
from
the
point
of
view
of
their
internal
structure
we
find
an
additional
profound
difference
between
the
third
and
the
first
two
one
that
accounts
for
the
notable
difference
between
the
responses
they
evoke
first
two
types
of
change
occur
within
the
inward
and
immanent
structure
of
the
society
first
involves
a
simple
shift
of
interests
in
the
society
second
involves
something
deeper
but
its
characteristic
form
focuses
on
a
shift
in
policy
for
the
community
not
in
the
truth
on
which
the
community
rests
in
both
types
attention
is
focused
on
the
community
itself
and
its
phenomenological
life
third
type
however
wrenches
attention
from
the
life
of
action
and
interests
in
the
community
and
focuses
it
on
the
ground
of
being
on
which
the
community
depends
for
its
existence
has
analyzed
this
experience
in
the
case
of
the
stable
healthy
community
the
community
faced
with
the
need
to
formulate
policy
on
the
level
of
absolute
justice
can
find
the
answer
to
its
problem
in
the
absolute
truth
which
it
holds
as
partially
experienced
however
cannot
be
done
by
a
community
whose
very
experience
of
truth
is
confused
and
incoherent
it
has
no
absolute
standard
and
consequently
cannot
distinguish
the
absolute
from
the
contingent
has
lost
its
ground
of
being
and
floats
in
a
mist
of
appearances
and
equality
are
its
characteristic
diseases
at
the
moment
when
it
has
lost
its
vision
the
mind
of
the
community
turns
out
from
itself
in
a
search
for
the
ontological
standard
whereby
it
can
measure
itself
paradigmatic
history
breaks
rather
than
unfolds
precisely
when
the
movement
is
from
order
to
disorder
and
not
from
one
order
to
a
new
order
split
to
define
it
further
derives
from
a
basic
difference
concerning
the
existential
status
of
standard
sought
and
about
the
spiritual
experience
that
leads
to
its
identification
disruptive
change
has
penetrated
to
the
third
level
of
social
order
the
process
of
disruption
rapidly
reaches
a
point
of
no
return
it
is
probable
that
this
point
is
reached
the
moment
the
third
level
of
change
begins
that
point
we
reach
the
closed
historical
situation
the
situation
in
which
man
is
no
longer
free
to
return
to
a
status
quo
ante
that
point
men
become
aware
of
the
mystery
of
history
called
variously
fate
or
destiny
or
providence
and
feel
themselves
caught
helplessly
in
the
writhing
of
a
disrupted
society
reasons
for
this
experience
are
rooted
in
the
metaphysical
characteristics
of
such
a
change
all
forms
of
being
society
or
community
has
the
greatest
element
of
determinability
ontological
status
is
itself
most
tenuous
because
apart
from
individual
men
who
are
its
matter
tradition
the
form
of
society
exists
only
as
a
shared
perception
of
truth
ontological
status
of
society
thus
is
constituted
by
the
psychological
status
of
members
content
of
that
psychological
status
determines
ultimately
the
content
of
civilization
social
civilizational
factors
not
rooted
in
the
human
spirit
of
the
group
ultimately
cease
to
exist
itself
tradition
falls
out
of
existence
when
the
human
spirit
itself
becomes
confused
is
what
man
has
made
of
himself
massive
contours
are
rooted
in
the
simple
need
of
man
since
he
is
always
incomplete
to
complete
himself
is
not
enough
for
man
to
be
an
ontological
esse
needs
existential
completion
he
needs
that
is
to
move
in
the
direction
of
completion
the
direction
of
that
movement
is
determined
by
his
perception
of
the
truth
about
himself
must
consequently
exist
as
a
substantive
developing
agent
or
he
does
not
exist
as
man
it
is
no
mystical
intuition
but
an
analyzable
conception
to
say
that
man
and
his
tradition
can
fall
out
of
existence
happens
at
the
moment
man
loses
the
perception
of
moral
substance
in
himself
of
a
nature
that
in
words
is
perceived
as
a
locus
of
intelligible
necessities
existentialist
is
a
man
who
perceives
himself
only
as
esse
as
existence
without
substance
human
perception
and
human
volition
is
the
immanent
cause
of
all
social
change
and
this
most
truly
when
the
change
reaches
the
civilizational
level
with
regard
to
the
loss
of
tradition
in
the
change
from
order
to
disorder
the
metaphysics
of
change
works
itself
out
as
a
disruption
of
the
individual
soul
a
change
in
which
man
continues
as
an
objective
ontological
existent
but
no
longer
as
a
man
change
is
a
form
of
motion
it
occurs
as
the
act
of
a
being
in
potency
insofar
as
it
is
in
potency
and
has
not
yet
reached
the
terminus
of
the
change
regard
to
the
change
we
are
examining
the
question
is
at
what
point
does
the
change
become
irreversible
number
of
considerations
suggest
that
this
occurs
early
in
the
process
involves
the
displacement
of
form
means
that
the
inception
of
change
itself
can
begin
only
when
the
factors
conducive
to
change
have
already
become
more
powerful
than
those
anchoring
the
existent
form
in
being
the
existent
form
is
to
be
retained
new
factors
that
reinforce
it
must
be
introduced
into
the
situation
the
case
of
social
decay
form
is
displaced
simply
by
the
process
of
dissolution
with
no
form
at
the
terminus
of
the
process
in
the
mere
fact
of
the
beginning
of
such
displacement
we
have
evidence
of
the
ontological
weakness
of
the
fading
form
when
we
consider
the
tenuous
hold
tradition
has
on
existence
any
weakening
of
that
hold
constitutes
a
crisis
of
existence
retention
of
a
tradition
confronted
with
such
a
crisis
necessitates
the
introduction
of
new
spiritual
forces
into
the
situation
the
crisis
occurs
precisely
as
a
weakening
of
spiritual
forces
would
seem
therefore
that
in
a
civilizational
crisis
man
cannot
save
himself
emergence
of
the
crisis
itself
would
seem
to
constitute
a
warranty
for
the
victory
of
disorder
it
would
seem
that
history
is
a
witness
to
this
truth
a
further
characterization
of
the
liberal
conservative
split
we
may
observe
that
it
involves
differences
in
the
formula
for
escaping
inevitabilities
in
history
differences
in
turn
derive
from
prior
differences
concerning
the
friendly
or
hostile
character
of
change
responses
anxiety
and
deep
insecurity
are
the
characteristic
responses
evoked
by
the
crisis
in
tradition
experience
them
it
is
not
necessary
for
a
people
to
be
actively
aware
of
what
is
happening
to
it
process
of
erosion
need
only
undermine
the
tradition
and
a
series
of
consequences
begin
unfolding
within
the
individual
while
in
institutions
a
quiet
but
deep
transformation
of
processes
occurs
the
individual
the
reaction
has
been
called
various
names
all
however
pointing
to
the
same
basic
experience
identifies
it
as
being
rootless
as
being
placeless
as
being
lonely
call
it
alienation
and
mean
by
that
no
simple
economic
experience
as
does
but
a
deep
spiritual
sense
of
dislocation
institutions
there
is
a
marked
decline
of
the
process
of
persuasion
and
the
substitution
of
a
process
which
masquerades
as
the
earlier
one
of
persuasion
note
the
use
of
rhetoric
as
a
weapon
the
manipulation
of
the
masses
by
propaganda
the
mobilization
of
effort
and
resources
this
context
of
spontaneous
and
unanalyzed
responses
to
the
experience
of
civilizational
crisis
two
basic
organizations
of
response
are
observable
reaction
and
ideological
progressivism
responses
are
explicable
in
terms
of
characteristics
inherent
in
the
crisis
are
predictably
destined
to
fail
response
of
reaction
is
dominated
by
a
concern
for
what
is
vanishing
essence
lies
in
its
attempt
to
recover
previous
order
through
the
repression
of
disruptive
forces
this
end
political
authority
is
called
upon
to
exercise
its
negative
and
coercive
powers
implicit
assumption
of
this
response
is
that
history
is
reversible
order
is
perceived
as
a
kind
of
subsistent
entity
now
covered
by
adventitious
accretions
problem
is
to
remove
the
accretions
and
thereby
uncover
the
order
that
was
always
there
a
response
of
course
misses
the
point
that
in
crisis
order
is
going
out
of
existence
its
posture
of
stubborn
but
simple
resistance
is
doomed
to
failure
because
of
the
metaphysical
weakness
of
the
existent
form
of
order
once
the
activation
of
change
has
reached
visible
proportions
most
reaction
can
achieve
is
stasis
and
a
stasis
that
can
be
maintained
only
by
the
expenditure
of
an
effort
which
ultimately
exhausts
itself
the
hopelessness
of
the
response
it
is
explicable
in
terms
of
the
crisis
of
tradition
itself
a
civilizational
crisis
involves
also
a
crisis
in
private
interests
and
in
the
ruling
class
reaction
is
normally
found
among
those
who
feel
themselves
to
be
among
the
ruling
class
great
error
is
to
mingle
the
responses
typical
of
each
of
the
three
types
of
change
civilizational
change
is
the
most
difficult
to
perceive
and
analyze
it
seldom
is
given
adequate
attention
the
anxiety
it
generates
is
misinterpreted
as
anxiety
over
private
interest
and
threatened
social
status
basic
truth
in
the
reactionary
response
is
to
be
found
in
its
realistic
assumption
of
the
primacy
of
the
real
over
the
ideational
this
truth
is
distorted
by
its
extreme
application
the
assumption
of
the
separate
existence
of
tradition
reactionary
misses
the
point
that
tradition
exists
ontologically
only
in
the
form
of
relations
theories
for
this
reason
usually
assume
some
form
of
organismic
theory
its
defensive
formulations
the
theory
will
attack
conscious
change
on
the
grounds
of
the
independent
existence
of
the
community
its
dynamic
form
it
visualizes
the
community
as
the
embodiment
of
an
ontological
force
the
race
for
instance
which
unfolds
in
history
both
cases
the
individual
tends
to
be
treated
as
an
instrument
of
the
organic
reality
the
reactionary
response
is
thus
bolstered
by
an
intellectual
defense
the
characteristics
of
that
defense
are
explicable
only
in
terms
of
the
basic
attitudes
of
unanalyzed
reaction
is
rooted
in
a
perception
of
tradition
as
a
whole
is
a
total
situation
that
is
defended
the
good
old
days
is
no
selectivity
even
the
questionable
features
of
the
past
are
defended
point
is
that
the
reactionary
for
whatever
motive
perceives
himself
to
have
been
part
or
a
partner
of
something
that
extended
beyond
himself
something
which
consequently
he
was
not
able
to
accept
or
reject
on
the
basis
of
subjective
preference
reactionary
is
confused
about
the
existential
status
of
a
decaying
tradition
but
he
does
perceive
the
unity
tradition
had
when
it
was
healthy
of
which
brings
up
another
problem
in
the
use
of
psychoanalytic
insight
in
a
literary
work
the
complex
the
clinical
syndrome
material
for
a
tragedy
we
remove
ourselves
for
a
moment
from
our
time
and
our
infatuation
with
mental
disease
there
something
absurd
about
a
hero
in
a
novel
who
is
defeated
by
his
infantile
neurosis
am
not
making
a
clinical
judgment
here
for
such
personal
tragedies
are
real
and
are
commonplace
in
the
consulting
room
but
literature
makes
a
different
claim
upon
our
sympathies
than
tragedy
in
life
man
in
a
novel
who
is
defeated
in
his
childhood
and
condemned
by
unconscious
forces
within
him
to
tiredly
repeat
his
earliest
failure
in
love
only
makes
us
a
little
weary
of
man
his
tragedy
seems
unworthy
and
trivial
we
can
argue
that
the
irresistible
fate
of
was
nothing
more
than
the
irresistible
unconscious
longings
of
projected
outward
but
this
externalization
of
unconscious
conflict
makes
all
the
difference
between
a
story
and
a
clinical
case
history
can
also
argue
that
the
three
brothers
and
were
the
external
representatives
of
an
internal
conflict
within
one
man
a
conflict
having
to
do
with
and
the
wish
to
possess
the
woman
a
novel
in
which
one
man
explored
the
divisions
within
his
personality
would
scarcely
merit
publication
in
the
is
a
mistake
to
look
upon
the
of
as
a
literary
descendant
of
the
psychological
truth
in
the
myth
an
who
is
drawn
to
his
fate
by
irresistible
external
forces
can
carry
the
symbol
of
humanity
and
its
archaic
crime
and
the
incest
that
is
unknowing
renews
the
mystery
of
the
eternal
dream
of
childhood
and
absorbs
us
in
the
secret
a
modern
who
is
doomed
because
he
cannot
oppose
his
own
childhood
is
only
pathetic
and
for
renouncing
the
mystery
in
favor
of
psychological
truth
he
gives
up
the
claim
on
our
sympathies
am
suggesting
that
a
approach
to
the
complex
is
a
blind
alley
for
a
storyteller
best
gifts
of
the
novelist
will
be
wasted
on
the
reader
who
is
insulated
against
any
surprises
the
novelist
may
have
in
store
for
him
is
still
a
durable
theme
but
if
it
wants
to
get
written
about
it
will
have
to
find
ways
to
surprise
the
emotions
and
there
is
no
better
way
to
do
this
than
that
of
concealment
and
symbolic
representation
the
best
way
to
conceal
and
disguise
the
elements
of
an
incest
story
is
not
to
set
out
to
write
an
incest
story
brings
to
mind
another
story
and
some
interesting
comparisons
in
the
treatment
of
the
theme
is
also
a
story
about
a
love
for
his
mother
now
risk
some
comparisons
with
let
it
be
clear
that
am
not
comparing
the
two
works
or
judging
their
merits
am
only
singling
out
differences
in
treatment
of
a
theme
and
the
resultant
effects
is
a
fantasy
with
extraordinary
power
to
disturb
the
reader
but
we
do
not
know
why
is
the
story
of
the
hopeless
love
of
a
little
boy
for
his
cold
and
vain
mother
are
ghostly
scenes
in
which
the
little
boy
on
his
rocking
horse
rocks
madly
toward
the
climax
that
will
magically
give
him
the
name
of
the
winning
horse
child
grows
rich
on
his
winnings
and
conspires
with
his
uncle
to
make
secret
gifts
of
his
money
to
his
mother
story
ends
in
the
illness
and
delirium
brought
on
by
the
feverish
compulsion
to
ride
his
horse
to
win
for
his
mother
child
dies
with
his
mourning
mother
at
his
bedside
had
read
the
story
many
times
without
asking
myself
why
it
affected
me
or
caring
why
it
did
on
one
occasion
when
encountered
a
similar
fantasy
in
a
little
boy
who
was
my
patient
began
to
understand
the
uncanny
effects
of
this
story
was
of
course
a
little
fantasy
of
winning
his
mother
to
himself
and
replacing
the
father
who
could
not
give
her
the
things
she
wanted
a
classical
oedipal
fantasy
if
you
like
but
if
it
were
only
this
the
story
would
be
banal
does
the
story
affect
us
does
the
rocking
exert
its
uncanny
effect
upon
the
reader
rocking
is
actually
felt
in
the
story
a
terrible
and
ominous
rhythm
that
prophesies
the
tragedy
rocking
realized
is
the
single
element
in
the
story
that
carries
the
erotic
message
the
unspoken
and
unconscious
undercurrent
that
would
mar
the
innocence
of
a
fantasy
and
disturb
the
effects
of
the
work
if
it
were
made
explicit
rocking
has
the
ambiguous
function
of
keeping
the
erotic
undercurrent
silent
and
making
it
present
it
conceals
and
yet
is
suggestive
a
perfect
symbol
if
we
understand
the
rocking
as
an
erotic
symbol
we
can
also
see
how
well
it
serves
as
the
symbol
of
impending
tragedy
this
love
of
the
boy
for
his
mother
is
a
hopeless
and
forbidden
love
doomed
by
its
nature
are
also
struck
by
the
fact
that
this
story
of
a
love
for
his
mother
does
not
offend
while
the
incestuous
love
of
the
man
sometimes
repels
easy
to
see
why
love
belongs
to
childhood
we
accord
it
its
place
there
and
in
treatment
we
are
given
the
innocent
fantasy
of
a
child
in
fact
the
form
in
which
oedipal
love
is
expressed
in
childhood
when
the
child
dies
in
story
in
a
delirium
that
is
somehow
brought
on
by
his
mania
to
win
and
to
make
his
mother
rich
the
manifest
absurdity
of
such
a
disease
and
such
a
death
does
not
enter
into
our
thoughts
at
all
have
so
completely
entered
the
fantasy
that
his
illness
and
his
death
are
the
plausible
and
the
necessary
conclusion
am
sure
that
none
of
the
effects
of
this
story
were
consciously
employed
by
to
describe
an
oedipal
fantasy
in
childhood
is
most
probable
that
and
the
complex
never
entered
his
head
in
the
writing
of
this
story
was
simply
writing
a
story
that
wanted
to
be
told
and
in
the
writing
a
childhood
fantasy
of
his
own
emerged
would
not
have
cared
why
it
emerged
he
only
wanted
to
capture
a
memory
to
play
with
it
again
in
his
imagination
and
somehow
to
fix
and
hold
in
the
story
the
disturbing
emotions
that
accompanied
the
fantasy
our
own
time
we
have
seen
that
the
debt
to
psychoanalysis
has
increased
but
that
the
novel
itself
has
not
profited
much
from
this
marriage
hope
that
modern
psychology
might
yet
bring
forth
a
last
flowering
of
the
novel
has
only
been
partially
fulfilled
young
writer
seems
intimidated
by
psychological
knowledge
he
has
lost
confidence
in
his
own
eyes
and
in
the
validity
of
his
own
psychological
insights
borrows
the
insights
of
psychology
to
improve
his
impaired
vision
but
cannot
bring
to
his
work
the
distinctive
vision
that
should
be
a
own
has
been
seduced
by
the
marvels
of
the
unconscious
and
has
lost
interest
in
studying
the
surfaces
of
character
many
of
the
characters
in
contemporary
novels
appear
to
be
the
bloodless
relations
of
characters
in
a
case
history
it
is
because
the
novelist
is
often
forgetful
today
that
those
things
that
we
call
character
manifest
themselves
in
surface
behavior
that
the
ego
is
still
the
executive
agency
of
personality
and
that
all
we
know
of
personality
must
be
discerned
through
the
ego
novelist
who
has
been
badly
baptized
in
psychoanalysis
often
gives
us
the
impression
that
since
all
men
must
have
an
complex
all
men
must
have
the
same
faces
have
argued
that
of
the
complex
has
a
doubtful
future
as
a
tragic
figure
in
literature
a
writer
who
has
a
taste
for
irony
and
who
sees
incest
in
all
its
modern
dimensions
can
let
his
imagination
work
on
the
disturbing
joke
in
the
incest
myth
the
joke
that
strikes
right
at
the
center
of
humanness
dread
is
seen
as
the
other
face
of
desire
and
here
psychoanalysis
delivers
to
the
writer
a
magnificent
irony
and
a
moral
problem
of
great
complexity
is
probably
some
significance
in
the
fact
that
two
of
the
best
incest
stories
have
encountered
in
recent
years
are
burlesques
of
the
incest
myth
ancient
types
are
reassembled
in
gloom
and
foreboding
to
be
irresistibly
drawn
to
their
destinies
but
the
myth
fails
before
the
modern
truth
the
oracle
speaks
false
and
the
dream
speaks
true
both
the
tale
in
and
in
the
incest
hero
rises
above
the
myth
by
accepting
the
wish
as
motive
the
heroic
act
is

that
at

he
held
instead

it
must

went
to

him

of

ominous
character

concluded

to

the
lore
of
his

be

to

to
discover

there
is
no
evidence
that
since
then
he
has
ever
considered
himself
any
less
so
showing
no
inclination
apparently
to
absent
himself
from
his
native
region
even
for
short
periods
and
in
addition
writing
a
shelf
of
books
set
in
the

handled
in
those
books
an
astonishingly
complete
list
of
matters
which
have

extent
and
what
is
the
source
of
his
knowledge
own
testimony
is
that
he
has
read
very
little
in
the
history
of
the
implying
that
what
he
knows
of
that
history
has
come
to
him
orally
and
that
he
knows
the
world
around
him
primarily
from
his
own
unassisted
observation
denials
of
extensive
reading
notwithstanding
it
is
no
doubt
safe
to
assume
that
he
has
spent
time
schooling
himself
in
history
and
that
he
has
gained
some
acquaintance
with
the
chief
literary
authors
who
have
lived
in
the
or
have
written
about
the
believe
otherwise
would
be
unrealistic
in
looking
at
against
his
background
in
and
the
it
is
important
not
to
lose
the
broader
perspective
earliest
work
reflected
heavy
influences
from
and
continental
writers
is
plentiful
that
early
and
later
also
he
has
been
indebted
to
the
romancers
who
deal
in
extravagant
horror
to
the
symbolists
writing
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
century
and
in
particular
to
the
novelists
and
among
them
repeated
experimentation
with
the
techniques
of
fiction
testifies
to
an
independence
of
mind
and
an
originality
of
approach
but
it
also
shows
him
touching
at
many
points
the
stream
of
literary
development
back
of
him
intention
therefore
is
not
to
say
that
awareness
has
been
confined
within
the
borders
of
the
but
rather
that
he
has
looked
at
his
world
as
a
and
that
presumably
his
outlook
is
ingredients
of
novels
and
stories
are
by
no
means
new
with
him
and
most
of
the
problems
he
takes
up
have
had
the
attention
of
authors
before
him
useful
comment
on
his
relation
to
his
region
may
be
made
think
by
noting
briefly
how
in
handling
materials
and
problems
he
has
deviated
from
the
pattern
set
by
other
authors
while
remaining
faithful
to
the
essential
character
of
the
region
planter
aristocracy
has
appeared
in
literature
at
least
since
published
in
and
in
his
genial
portrait
of
presiding
over
his
plantation
dominion
initiated
the
most
persistent
tradition
of
literature
thoroughgoing
idealization
of
the
planter
society
did
not
come
however
until
after
the
when
writers
were
eager
to
defend
a
way
of
life
which
had
been
destroyed
they
looked
with
nostalgia
to
a
society
which
had
been
swept
away
they
were
probably
no
more
than
that
they
painted
in
colors
which
had
never
existed
books
found
no
less
willing
readers
outside
than
inside
the
even
while
memories
of
the
war
were
still
sharp
tradition
reached
its
apex
perhaps
in
the
works
of
toward
the
end
of
the
century
and
reappeared
undiminished
as
late
as
in
the
novel
by
was
the
heir
in
his
own
family
to
this
tradition
he
did
not
have
inclination
to
romanticize
and
sentimentalize
the
planter
society
myth
of
the
plantation
has
had
only
a
tangential
relation
with
actuality
as
showed
forty
years
ago
and
suspect
it
has
had
a
far
narrower
acceptance
as
something
real
than
has
generally
been
supposed
has
found
it
useful
but
he
has
employed
it
with
his
habitual
independence
of
mind
and
skeptical
outlook
saying
or
seeming
to
say
that
in
portraying
the
and
the
families
chief
concern
is
social
criticism
we
can
say
nevertheless
that
through
those
families
he
dramatizes
his
comment
on
the
planter
dynasties
as
they
have
existed
since
the
decades
before
the
may
be
that
in
this
comment
he
has
broken
from
the
conventional
pattern
more
violently
than
in
any
other
regard
for
the
treatment
in
his
books
is
far
removed
from
even
the
genial
irony
of
who
was
the
only
important
novelist
before
him
to
challenge
the
conventional
picture
of
planter
society
characters
had
but
few
counterparts
in
earlier
novels
dealing
with
plantation
life
have
an
ancestry
extending
back
however
at
least
to
when
described
the
he
encountered
in
the
back
country
of
and
chief
literary
antecedents
of
the
clan
appeared
in
the
realistic
humorous
writing
which
originated
in
the
and
the
in
the
three
decades
before
the
narratives
of
coarse
action
and
crude
language
appeared
first
in
local
newspapers
as
a
rule
and
later
found
their
way
between
book
covers
though
rarely
into
the
libraries
beside
the
volumes
of
and
is
evidence
to
suggest
in
fact
that
many
authors
of
the
humorous
sketches
were
prompted
to
write
them
or
to
make
them
as
indelicate
as
they
are
by
way
of
protesting
against
the
artificial
refinements
which
had
come
to
dominate
the
polite
letters
of
the
sturdy
realist
that
he
was
pleaded
for
a
natural
robustness
such
as
he
found
in
his
favorites
the
great
to
vivify
the
pale
writings
being
produced
around
him
admired
the
raucous
tales
emanating
from
the
backwoods
but
he
had
himself
social
affiliations
which
would
not
allow
him
to
approve
them
fully
a
preacher
and
a
college
and
university
president
in
four
states
published
the
earliest
of
these
backwoods
sketches
and
in
the
character
in
the
accounts
of
sharp
and
physical
combat
and
in
the
shockingly
unliterary
speech
of
his
characters
he
set
an
example
followed
by
many
after
him
who
wrote
of
low
characters
and
low
life
included
creator
of
the
and
the
whose
character
bears
a
close
kinship
to
in
both
his
willingness
to
take
cruel
advantage
of
all
and
sundry
and
the
sharpness
with
which
he
habitually
carried
out
his
will
and
whose
hillbilly
character
perpetrated
more
unmalicious
mischief
and
more
unintended
pain
than
any
other
character
in
literature
would
be
profitable
believe
to
read
these
realistic
humorists
alongside
works
the
thought
being
not
that
he
necessarily
read
them
and
owed
anything
to
them
directly
but
rather
that
they
dealt
a
hundred
years
ago
with
a
class
of
people
and
a
type
of
life
which
have
continued
down
to
our
time
to
time
a
comparison
reminds
us
that
in
employing
low
characters
in
his
works
is
recording
actuality
in
the
and
moreover
is
following
a
literary
precedent
characters
with
their
low
existence
and
often
low
morality
produce
humorous
effects
in
his
novels
and
tales
as
they
did
in
the
writing
of
and
and
but
it
need
not
be
added
that
he
gives
them
far
subtler
and
more
intricate
functions
than
they
had
in
the
earlier
writers
nor
is
there
need
to
add
that
among
them
are
some
of
the
most
highly
individualized
and
most
successful
of
his
characters
of
the
early
humorists
already
mentioned
can
be
used
to
illustrate
another
point
where
touches
authentic
materials
and
also
earlier
literary
treatment
of
those
materials
came
to
from
the
as
a
young
man
prepared
to
find
in
the
new
country
the
setting
of
romantic
adventure
and
idealized
beauty
saw
also
the
hardships
of
pioneer
existence
the
cultural
poverty
of
the
frontier
settlements
and
the
slack
morality
which
abounded
in
the
new
regions
a
consequence
of
the
tensions
thus
produced
in
his
thoughts
and
feelings
he
wrote
on
the
one
hand
sketches
of
idealized
hunting
trips
and
on
the
other
an
anecdote
of
the
village
of
where
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
piano
and
he
wrote
also
the
masterpiece
of
frontier
humor
in
which
earthy
realism
is
placed
alongside
the
exaggeration
of
the
backwoods
and
the
awe
with
which
man
contemplates
the
grandeur
and
the
mysteries
of
nature
years
ago
proposed
to
an
audience
made
up
of
members
of
the
for
the
of
that
supernormal
or
faculties
are
now
in
the
same
case
as
were
his
mathematical
faculties
during
the
ice
age
a
interests
himself
in
the
possibilities
of
human
development
and
one
thing
we
can
say
about
this
suggestion
which
comes
from
a
leading
zoologist
is
that
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
the
scientific
outlook
places
no
rigid
limitation
upon
the
idea
of
future
human
evolution
text
from
is
sometimes
used
by
enthusiasts
to
indicate
that
they
have
the
permission
of
the
scientists
to
press
the
case
for
a
wonderful
unfoldment
of
psychic
powers
in
human
beings
may
be
a
case
of
this
sort
but
it
is
not
one
we
wish
to
argue
here
if
people
do
in
a
not
far
distant
future
begin
to
read
one
minds
there
will
still
be
the
question
of
whether
what
you
find
in
another
mind
is
especially
worth
reading
worth
more
that
is
than
what
you
can
read
in
good
books
if
men
eventually
find
themselves
able
to
look
through
walls
and
around
corners
one
may
question
whether
this
will
help
them
to
live
better
lives
would
be
to
be
drawn
of
course
such
capacities
are
impressive
evidence
pointing
to
a
conception
of
the
human
being
which
does
not
appear
in
the
accounts
of
biologists
and
organic
evolutionists
but
the
basic
puzzles
of
existence
would
still
be
puzzling
and
we
should
still
have
to
work
out
the
sort
of
problems
we
plan
to
discuss
in
this
article
we
want
from
statement
is
the
feeling
that
this
is
an
open
world
in
the
view
of
the
best
scientific
opinion
with
practically
no
directional
commitments
as
to
what
may
happen
next
and
no
important
confinements
with
respect
to
what
may
be
possible
seems
quite
obvious
that
all
the
really
difficult
tasks
of
human
beings
arise
from
the
fact
that
man
is
not
one
but
many
man
that
is
is
both
one
and
many
is
a
dreamer
of
the
good
society
with
a
plan
to
put
into
effect
and
he
is
an
individual
craftsman
with
something
to
make
for
himself
and
the
people
of
his
time
is
a
parent
with
a
child
to
nurture
here
and
now
and
he
is
an
educator
who
worries
about
the
children
half
way
round
the
world
is
a
utopian
with
a
stake
in
tomorrow
and
he
is
a
vulnerable
human
made
captive
by
the
circumstances
of
today
can
sacrifice
himself
for
tomorrow
and
he
can
sacrifice
tomorrow
for
himself
is
a
wife
who
agonizes
about
tobacco
ash
on
the
living
room

and
he
is
a
forgetful
genius
who
goes
boating
with
the
town
baker
when
dignitaries
from
the
local
university
have
come
to
call
is
the
stern
guardian
of
the
status
quo
who
has
raised
the
utilitarian
structures
of
the
age
and
he
is
the
revolutionary
poet
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
who
writes
a
tragic
apologetic
to
posterity
for
the
men
he
has
killed
will
be
the
final
symmetry
of
the
good
society
what
do
the
utopians
labor
on
a
desk
is
a
stack
of
pamphlets
representing
the
efforts
of
some
of
the
best
men
of
the
day
to
penetrate
these
questions
pamphlets
are
about
law
the
corporation
forms
of
government
the
idea
of
freedom
the
defense
of
liberty
the
various
lethargies
which
overtake
our
major
institutions
the
gap
between
traditional
social
ideals
and
the
working
mechanisms
that
have
been
set
in
motion
for
their
realization
thing
that
is
notable
in
all
these
discussions
is
the
lack
of
ideological
ardor
is
another
kind
of
ardor
a
quiet
sure
devotion
to
the
fundamental
decencies
of
human
life
but
no
angry
utopian
contentions
you
could
wish
for
some
passion
now
and
then
but
when
you
look
around
the
world
and
see
the
little
volcanos
of
current
history
which
partisan
social
passions
have
wrought
you
are
glad
that
in
these
pamphlets
there
is
at
least
some
civilized
calm
could
also
say
that
in
these
pamphlets
is
a
relieving
quality
of
maturity
is
essential
pleasantness
in
reading
the
writing
of
men
who
are
not
angry
who
can
contend
without
quarreling
is
the
good
kind
of
sophistication
and
with
all
our
problems
and
crises
this
kind
of
sophistication
has
flowered
in
the
during
recent
years
characteristic
expression
of
such
concern
and
inquiry
is
found
in
a
recent
paperback
study
of
the
institutions
of
modern
democratic
society
gives
voice
to
a
temper
that
represents
we
think
an
achieved
plateau
of
reflective
thinking
casting
about
for
a
way
of
describing
this
spirit
we
decided
that
it
would
be
better
to
use
introduction
as
an
illustration
begins
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
the
had
done
us
a
favor
by
providing
a
striking
example
of
how
not
to
behave
towards
other
peoples
and
other
nations
things
turned
out
however
we
have
not
profited
greatly
from
the
lesson
instead
of
persistently
following
a
national
program
of
our
own
we
have
often
been
satisfied
to
be
against
whatever
policy
seemed
to
be
at
the
moment
activity
may
or
may
not
have
irritated
the
but
it
has
frequently
condemned
to
an
unnatural
defensiveness
that
has
undermined
our
effort
to
give
leadership
to
the
free
world
defensiveness
has
been
exaggerated
by
another
bad
habit
our
tendency
to
rate
the
goodness
or
badness
of
other
nations
by
the
extent
to
which
they
applaud
the
slogans
we
circulate
about
ourselves
the
slogans
have
little
application
to
reality
and
are
sanctimonious
to
boot
the
applause
is
faint
even
in
areas
of
the
world
where
we
should
expect
to
find
the
greatest
affection
for
free
government
at
the
response
to
our
proclamations
we
grow
more
defensive
and
worse
we
lose
our
sense
of
humor
and
proportion

subjected
to
stern
lectures
on
neutralism
by
our
of
and
an
observes
sourly
that
would
be
a
little
less
neurotic
if
it
were
a
little
more
capitalistic
thing
you
can
say
about
is
that
he
does
not
suffer
from
any
insecurity
as
an
who
are
insecure
fear
to
be
candid
in
the
strong
look
squarely
at
weakness
maturity
in
this
point
of
view
lies
in
its
recognition
that
no
basic
problem
is
ever
solved
without
being
clearly
understood
continues
if
the
self
portrait
we
distribute
for
popular
consumption
were
accurate
it
would
be
dangerous
to
present
it
as
a
picture
of
the
ideal
society
would
be
ignoring
the
special
circumstances
of
other
countries
picture
is
the
more
treacherous
when
it
misrepresents
the
facts
of
life
discrepancy
between
what
we
commonly
profess
and
what
we
practice
or
tolerate
is
great
and
it
does
not
escape
the
notice
of
others
our
sincerity
is
granted
and
it
is
granted
the
discrepancy
can
only
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
we
have
come
to
believe
hearsay
and
legend
about
ourselves
in
preference
to
an
understanding
gained
by
earnest
is
more
the
legends
have
become
so
sacrosanct
that
the
very
habit
of
or
smells
of
low
treason
and
men
who
practice
it
are
defeatists
and
unpatriotic
scoundrels
we
continue
to
pay
our
conversational
devotions
to
free
private
enterprise
individual
initiative
the
democratic
way
government
of
the
people
competition
of
the
marketplace
we
live
rather
comfortably
in
a
society
in
which
economic
competition
is
diminishing
in
large
areas
bureaucracy
is
corroding
representative
government
technology
is
weakening
the
confidence
in
his
own
power
to
make
decisions
and
the
threat
of

is
driving
him
economically
and
physically
into
the
ground
interesting
thing
about
approach
and
the
approach
of
the
contributors
to
to
the
situation
of
civilization
is
that
it
is
concerned
with
comprehending
the
psychological
relationships
which
are
having
a
decisive
effect
on
life
an
ideological
argument
the
participants

to
thump
the
table

prove
something
new
spirit
so
well
illustrated
by
work

wholly
free
of
this
anxiety
problem
is
rather
to
find
out
what
is
actually
happening
and
this
is
especially
difficult
for
the
reason
that
we
are
busily
being
defended
from
a
knowledge
of
the
present
sometimes
by
the
very
agencies
our
educational
system
our
mass
media
our
statesmen
on
which
we
have
had
to
rely
most
heavily
for
understanding
of
ourselves
continues
experience
a
vague
uneasiness
about
events
a
suspicion
that
our
political
and
economic
institutions
like
the
genie
in
the
bottle
have
escaped
confinement
and
that
we
have
lost
the
power
to
recall
them
feel
uncomfortable
at
being
bossed
by
a
corporation
or
a
union
or
a
television
set
but
until
we
have
some
knowledge
about
these
phenomena
and
what
they
are
doing
to
us
we
can
hardly
learn
to
control
them
does
not
appear
that
we
will
be
delivered
from
our
situation
by
articles
on
is
an
attempt
to
explore
some
of
the
institutions
which
both
reflect
and
determine
the
character
of
the
free
society
today
men
who
speculate
on
these
institutions
have
for
the
most
part
come
to
at
least
one
common
conclusion
that
many
of
the
great
enterprises
and
associations
around
which
our
democracy
is
formed
are
in
themselves
autocratic
in
nature
and
possessed
of
power
which
can
be
used
to
frustrate
the
citizen

that

reality
of
the

however
is
described
by
of

may
even
be
secretly
relieved
at
having
a
plausible
excuse
to
delegate
ancient
civic
responsibilities
to
a
new
bureaucracy
of
experts
the
member
of
an
industrial
union
comes
to
regard
his

as
business
agents
who
may
proceed
without

or

the

the
citizen
narrows
his
political
participation
to
the
mere
act
of

he
votes
at
all
did
not
question
it
could
not
the
conceptual
context
within
which
ancient
thought
thrived
how
could
anyone
have
questioned
this
principle
reasons
for
this
are
partly
observational
partly
philosophical
and
reinforced
by
other
aesthetic
and
cultural
factors
the
observational
reasons
obvious
natural
fact
to
ancient
thinkers
was
the
diurnal
rotation
of
the
heavens
only
did
constellations
like
and
spin
circles
around
the
pole
but
stars
which
were
not
circumpolar
rose
and
set
at
the
same
place
on
the
horizon
each
night
did
a
stars
vary
in
brightness
during
the
course
of
their
nocturnal
flights
conclusion
the
distances
of
the
constellations
did
not
vary
and
their
paths
were
circular
the
path
over
earth
described
a
segment
of
a
great
circle
this
was
clear
from
the
contour
of
the
shadow
traced
by
a
gnomon
before
and
after
noon
early
as
the
century
the
earth
was
seen
to
be
spherical
disappear
over
the
horizon
approaching
shore
their
masts
appeared
first
being
at
the
center
of
the
universe
would
have
the
same
shape
as
the
latter
so
did
argue
although
this
may
not
be
an
observational
reason
in
favor
of
circularity
discoid
shapes
of
sun
and
moon
were
also
felt
to
indicate
the
shape
of
celestial
things
light
of
all
this
one
would
require
special
reasons
for
saying
that
the
paths
of
the
heavenly
bodies
were
other
than
circular
for
example
should
the
ancients
have
supposed
the
diurnal
rotation
of
the
heavens
to
be
elliptical
oviform
angular
were
no
reasons
for
such
suppositions
then
conjoined
with
the
considerations
above
made
the
circular
motions
of
heavenly
bodies
appear
an
almost
directly
observed
fact
philosophical
considerations
advanced
notably
by
supported
further
the
circularity
principle
distinguishing
superlunary
celestial
and
sublunary
terrestrial
existence
and
reinforcing
this
with
the
physics
of
came
to
speak
of
the
stars
as
perfect
bodies
which
moved
in
only
a
perfect
way
in
a
perfect
circle
what
is
perfect
motion
must
apparently
be
motion
without
termini
motion
which
begins
and
ends
at
discrete
places
would
for
be
incomplete
motion
however
since
it
is
eternal
and
perfectly
continuous
lacks
termini
is
never
motion
towards
something
imcomplete
imperfect
things
move
towards
what
they
lack
complete
entities
if
they
move
at
all
do
not
move
towards
what
they
lack
move
only
in
accordance
with
what
is
in
their
natures
circular
motion
is
itself
one
of
the
essential
characteristics
of
completely
perfect
celestial
existence
return
now
to
the
physics

mixture
of
muddy
frothy
water

when
standing
in
a
jar
separate

at
the

water
on

and
the
air
on

of
that
candle

its

a
clue
to
the
cosmical
order
of

earth

fallen

of
the

covered
partly
with

air

the

combined
with
the
metaphysical
notion
that
pure
forms
of
this
universe
are
best
appreciated
when
least
embodied
in
a
material
substratum
it
becomes
clear
that
while
earth
will
be
dross
on
a
scale
of
ratios
celestial
bodies
will
be
of
a
subtle
quickened
ethereal
existence
in
whose
embodiment
pure
form
will
be
the
dominant
component
and
matter
will
be
absent
or
remain
subsidiary
stars
constitute
an
order
of
existence
different
from
what
we
encounter
on
earth
is
clear
when
one
distinguishes
the
types
of
motion
appropriate
to
both
regions
projectile

its

the
natural
condition
for
the
heavenly
bodies

neither

nor
rectilinear

encumbered
by

embodiments
they
partake
more

the
publicized
contrasts
between
and
astronomy
there
never
was
a
system
of
astronomy
achievement
was
to
have
invented
systematic
astronomy
and
outline
conception
of
his
own
task
as
the
provision
of
computational
tables
independent
calculating
devices
for
the
prediction
of
future
planetary
perturbations
in
the
edition
of
presentation
of
there
is
a
chart
setting
out
under
six
distinct
headings
otherwise
unrelated
diagrams
for
describing
the
planetary
motions
attempt
is
made
by
to
weld
into
a
single
scheme
these
independent
all
have
this
in
common
the
earth
is
situated
near
the
center
of
the
deferent
that
one
should
superimpose
all
these
charts
run
a
pin
through
the
common
point
and
then
scale
each
planetary
deferent
larger
and
smaller
to
keep
the
epicycles
from
bumping
this
is
contrary
to
any
intention
ever
expresses
might
even
suppose
the
planets
to
move
at
infinity
problem
is
to
forecast
where
against
the
inverted
bowl
of
night
some
particular
light
will
be
found
at
future
times
problem
concerns
longitudes
latitudes
and
angular
velocities
distances
of
these
points
of
light
is
a
problem
he
cannot
master
beyond
crude
conjectures
as
to
the
orderings
of
the
planetary
orbits
viewed
outward
from
earth
none
of
this
has
prevented
scientists
philosophers
and
even
historians
of
science
from
speaking
of
the
system
in
contrast
to
the
is
a
mistake
is
engendered
by
confounding
the
cosmology
in
with
the
geocentric
astronomy
recurrently
denies
that
he
could
ever
explain
planetary
motion
is
what
necessitates
the
nonsystematic
character
of
his
astronomy
when
textbooks
like
that
of
set
out
drawings
of
the
complete
with
earth
in
the
center
and
the
seven
heavenly
bodies
epicyclically
arranged
on
their
several
deferents
we
have
nothing
but
a
misleading
idea
of
what
never
existed
historically
is
the
chief
merit
in
work
that
all
his
planetary
calculations
are
interdependent
cannot
compute
the
retrograde
arc
traveled
by
without
also
making
suppositions
about
the
own
motion
cannot
describe
eclipses
without
entertaining
some
form
of
a
problem
terms
however
eclipses
and
retrograde
motion
were
phenomena
simpliciter
to
be
explained
directly
as
possible
resultants
of
epicyclical
combinations
a
systematic
astronomy
like
that
of
retrogradations
become
part
of
the
conceptual
structure
of
the
system
they
are
no
longer
a
puzzling
aspect
of
intricately
variable
local
planetary
motions
contrast
stressed
when
discussing
astronomy
turns
on
the
idea
of
simplicity
is
often
stated
that
astronomy
is
simpler
than
even
say
that
this
is
the
reason
for
the
ultimate
acceptance
of
the
former
remarks
large
number
of
unrelated
epicycles
was
needed
to
explain
the
observations
but
otherwise
the
system
served
well
and
with
quantitative
precision
by
placing
the
sun
at
the
center
of
the
planetary
universe
was
able
to
reduce
the
number
of
epicycles
from
to
seventeen
records
indicate
that
was
unaware
of
the
fundamental
aspects
of
his
revolution
unaware
perhaps
of
its
historical
importance
he
rested
content
with
having
produced
a
simpler
scheme
for
prediction
an
illustration
of
the
principle
of
simplicity
the
heliocentric
discovery
has
a
peculiar
appeal
because
it
allows
simplicity
to
be
arithmetized
it
involves
a
reduction
in
the
number
of
epicycles
from
to
seventeen
careful
qualification
this
can
be
misleading
in
any
one
calculation
had
had
to
invoke
epicycles
all
at
once
while
never
required
more
than
one
third
this
number
then
in
the
sense
obvious
to
astronomy
would
be
simpler
than
no
single
planetary
problem
ever
required
of
more
than
six
epicycles
at
one
time
of
course
results
from
the
cellular
character
of
theory
within
the
framework
always
raised
questions
about
planetary
configurations
could
be
met
only
by
considering
the
dynamical
elements
of
several
planets
at
one
time
is
more
ambitious
than
is
ever
required
to
be
when
he
faces
his
isolated
problems
in
no
ordinary
sense
of
simplicity
is
the
theory
simpler
than
the
latter
required
juggling
several
elements
simultaneously
was
not
simpler
but
much
more
difficult
than
exercises
within
astronomy
anyone
who
argues
that
theory
of
gravitation
is
simpler
than
must
say
rather
more
to
explain
how
it
is
that
the
latter
is
mastered
by
while
the
former
can
be
managed
with
difficulty
only
by
accomplished
experts
a
sense
theory
is
simpler
than
and
there
is
a
corresponding
sense
in
which
theory
is
simpler
than
simplicity
here
refers
to
systematic
simplicity
number
of
primitive
ideas
in
theories
is
reduced
to
a
minimum

to
make
the
theoretical
machinery

set
out
tersely
and
powerfully
so
that
all
permissible
operations
within
the

can
be
traced
rigorously
back
to
these
axioms
rules

primitive
notions
characterizes
formulation
of
geometry
but
not
astronomy
are
in
no
rules
for
determining
in
advance
whether
a
new
epicycle
will
be
required
for
dealing
with
abberations
in
lunar
solar
or
planetary
behavior
strongest
appeal
of
the
formulation
consisted
in
just
this
ideally
the
justification
for
dealing
with
special
problems
in
particular
ways
is
completely
set
out
in
the
basic
rules
of
the
theory
hypotheses
are
never
ad
hoc
never
introduced
ex
post
facto
just
to
sweep
up
within
the
theory
some
recalcitrant
datum
to
an
extent
unachieved
by
approximated
to
vision
is
not
just
a
collection
of
facts
and
techniques
is
an
organized
system
of
these
things
astronomical
problems
requires
for
not
a
random
search
of
unrelated
tables
but
a
regular
employment
of
the
rules
defining
the
entire
discipline
noting
the
simplicity
achieved
in
formulation

not
provide
another
reason
for
the

venerated

for
his

of

this
is
most
exasperating
to
men
who
expect
every
woman
to
verify
their
preconceived
notions
concerning
her
sex

when
she

who

either
foolhardy
overconfident

smart
shrewd
and
ambitious
young
man
well
connected
and
with
a
knack
for
getting
in
the
good
graces
of
important
people
he
was
bound
to
go
far
the
younger
son
of
the
distinguished
rabbi
was
a
friendly
fellow
with
a
little
mustache
whose
field
was
psychology
and
who
was
also
a
punster
and
a
jolly
tease
father
was
a
good
friend
of
and
lived
with
the
for
a
while
these
youths
who
greatly
admired
were
somewhat
younger
than
she
as
were
also
the
neighboring
boys
who
were
then
studying
medicine
and
bright
though
they
all
were
they
could
not
possibly
compete
for
her
interest
with
whose
mind
although
he
never
tried
to
dazzle
or
patronize
lesser
lights
with
it
naturally
eclipsed
theirs
and
made
them
seem
to
her
even
younger
than
they
were
as
she
was
generally
known
since
she
had
put
up
her
hair
with
a
chignon
in
the
back
had
little
time
to
spare
them
from
her
teaching
and
writing
so
became
interested
in
her
friend
and
the
only
young
man
who
when
he
wrote
had
the
temerity
to
address
her
as
and
signed
himself
fell
in
love
with
pretty
sister
however
was
at
that
time
engaged
in
a
lengthy
correspondence
with
older
and
more
serious
brother
who
was
just
about
her
own
age
and
whom
she
had
got
to
know
well
during
trips
to
with
when
he
substituted
for

there
during
its
absence
in
who
while
attending
the
of
also
taught
and
edited
a
paper
found
time
to
write
letters
on
everything
that
engaged
his
interest
from
the
acting
of
in
to
his
reactions
to
the
comments
of
on
the
reform
movement
being
promulgated
by
the
in
his
younger
brother
he
never
presumed
to
address
her
more
familiarly
than
as
dear
friend
although
he
praised
and
envied
the
elegance
and
purity
of
her
style
when
he
complained
of
the
lack
of
time
for
all
he
wanted
to
do
advised
him
to
rise
at
five
in
the
morning
as
she
and
did
thing
had
not
taught
was
how
to
handle
a
young
man
as
and
opinionated
as
herself
could
not
resist
the
opportunity
of
showing
her
superiority
in
argument
over
a
man
which
she
had
remarked
as
one
of
the
feminine
follies
of
and
in
her
forthright
way
who
in
her
story
of
had
indicated
her
own
unwillingness
to
think
of
men
as
the
privileged
and
women
as
submissive
and
yielding
felt
obliged
to
defend
vigorously
any
statement
of
hers
to
which
took
the
slightest
exception
he
objected
to
her
stand
on
the
affair
as
well
as
on
the
radical
reforms
of
of
until
once
in
sheer
desperation
he
wrote
that
he
had
given
up
hope
they
would
ever
agree
on
anything
that
did
not
prevent
him
from
writing
more
long
letters
or
from
coming
to
spend
his
vacations
with
the
hospitable

their
pleasant
house

little
women

and
each
other
said
on
the
first
page
of

do
think
that
families
are
the
most
beautiful
things
in
all
the
world
burst
out
some
five
hundred
pages
later
in
that
popular
story
of
the
family
which
had
first
appeared
when
was
eight
and
the
family
as
it
developed
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
like
was
a
clergyman
although
of
an
indeterminate
denomination
and
like
was
the
competent
manager
of
her
brood
of
girls
of
whom
the
had
only
four
to
the
five
the
girls
had
their
counterparts
in
the
girls
could
easily
identify
herself
with
although
was
not
the
eldest
sister
was
hoydenish
like
who
frankly
wished
she
were
a
boy
and
had
deliberately
shortened
her
name
which
like
was
the
feminine
form
of
a
name
both
were
and
vivacious
both
had
tempers
to
control
both
loved
languages
especially
and
both
were
good
teachers
and
wrote
for
publication
was
her
assistant
and
confidante
and
each
stood
out
conspicuously
in
the
family
picture
was
more
like
the
eldest
girl
who
learned
that
a
happiest
kingdom
is
home
her
highest
honor
the
art
of
ruling
it
not
as
a
queen
but
a
wise
wife
and
mother
like
was
from
the
start
her
daughter
destined
for
her
role
in
life
like
suffered
ill
health
got
rheumatic
fever
and
had
to
be
careful
of
her
heart
but
that
never
dampened
her
spirits
her
right
hand
was
incapacitated
by
the
rheumatism
learned
to
write
with
her
left
hand
wrote
gay
plays
about
the
girls
for
family
entertainments
like
in
which
under
appeared
as
and
who
was
only
a
trifle
less
brilliant
in
high
school
than
had
been
appeared
as
studied
piano
played
in
the
of
and
she
recited
most
movingly
to
the
special
delight
of
at
his
home
in
near
where
the
girls
took
turns
visiting
between
the
visits
of
the
boys
at
the
in
like
the
youngest
of
the
was
the
rebellious
mischievous
rather
calculating
and
ambitious
one
conceded
to
be
the
prettiest
of
the
girls
and
she
did
make
a
pretty
picture
sitting
in
the
strumming
her
guitar
and
singing
in
her
silvery
tones
there
was
no
particular
counterpart
but
both
groups
were
so
closely
knit
that
despite
individual
differences
the
family
life
in
both
cases
was
remarkably
similar
in
atmosphere
if
not
entirely
in
content
the
one
being
definitely
and
the
other
vaguely
like
the
enjoyed
and
loved
living
together
even
in
troubled
times
and
as
in
the
home
any
young
man
who
called
on
the
found
himself
confronted
with
a
phalanx
of
femininity
which
made
it
rather
difficult
to
direct
his
particular
attention
to
any
one
of
them
included
jolly
generous
and
pretty
with
whom
they
all
fell
in
love
just
as
had
first
fallen
in
love
with
her
before
he
chose
her
and
when
a
young
man
like
had
enjoyed
the
hospitality
he
felt
obliged
to
send
his
respects
and
his
gifts
not
merely
to
in
whom
he
was
really
interested
but
to
all
the
girls
and
just
as
was
first
attracted
to
bright
who
found
him
immature
by
her
high
standards
and
then
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
so
who
had
also
been
writing
before
he
came
to
had
to
content
himself
with
her
younger
sister
pretty
like
who
saw
her
sisters
and
involved
in
lovering
before
herself
saw
her
sisters
and
drawn
outside
their
family
circle
by
the
attraction
of
suitors
by
and
by
a
young
businessman
who
would
write
her
romantic
descriptions
of
his
trips
by
steamboat
down
the
time
he
was
making
no
mistake
in
her
country
the
nickname
was
a
respectful
form
of
address
was
not
only
attractive
but
shrewd
durable
sensible
and
smart
wonder
was
enchanted
no
two
better
suited
people
ever
met
from
that
day
until
his
death
was
to
stay
at
his
side
but
the
years
that
immediately
followed
were
to
be
extraordinarily
trying
both
for
and
his
lady
must
be
granted
that
the
flouting
of
convention
no
matter
how
well
intentioned
one
may
be
is
sure
to
lead
to
trouble
or
at
least
to
the
discomfort
that
goes
with
social
disapproval
so
many
of
the
things
that
happened
to
and
seem
inordinately
severe
afflictions
centered
on
one
maddening
difficulty
held
up
the
divorce

that
she
herself
had
asked
for

to
trail
everywhere
and
to
encourage
her
to
make
appalling
statements
about

his
doings

writs
attachments
and
unpleasant
legal
papers
of
every
sort
began
to
fly
through
the
air
distracted

agree
to
a
settlement
through
her
legal
representative
then
change
her
mind
and
make
another
attack

as
a
person

her
lawyer
gave
up
the
case
because
she
turned
down
three
successive
settlements
he

an
interesting
statement

from
his
client

to
be
a
lawyer
and
wanted
me
to
be
an
avenging
angel
got
out

without

first
thing
to
do
is
get
her
some
money
by
a
temporary
but
definite
adjustment

a

disposition

the

suggested
this

it
down

three
years
of
this
strange
warfare

during
the
unhappy
time

would
charge

somehow
when
officers
were

into

that
common
sense

not
died
out
at
the
county
and
village
level
though
why
the
unhappy
and
obviously
unbalanced
woman
was
not
restrained
remains
a
puzzle
misery
of
bitterness
can
be
felt
today
by
anyone
who
studies
the
case
it
was
hopeless
agonizing
and
destructive
with
herself
bearing
the
heaviest
burden
of
shame
and
pain
get
an
idea
of
the
embarrassment
and
chagrin
that
was
heaped
upon
and
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
the
raids
were
sometimes
led
by
in

the
most
distressing
of
these
scenes

at

warfare

a
beautiful
day
in
this
time

urging
on
whose
name

him
to
be
a
descendant
of
the
settlers
in
the
neighborhood
troop
of
reporters
brought
up
the
rear
was
stopped
at
the
gate
and
now
the
estate
foreman
came
out
to
parley
said
that
was
not
in
and
so
could
not
be
arrested
on
something
called
a
peace
warrant
that
was
waving
in
the
air
now
ordered
to
break
down
the
gate
but
he
said
he
really
go
that
far
this
point
one
of
handsome
daughters
by
his
first
wife
came
from
the
house
and
tried
to
calm
as
she
tore
down
a
no
visitors
sign
and
smashed
the
glass
pane
on
another
sign
with
a
rock
said
am
at
my
own
home
locked
out
so
must
stand
in
the
road
she
rounded
on
and
cried
always
did
dirty
work
take
over
the
first
thing
do
is
fire
you
think
you
had
better
go
said
think
you
had
better
leave
replied
to
the
reporters
she
asked
you
hear
her
think
you
had
better
leave
this
is
my
own
home
the
silence
that
followed
walked
close
to
who
drew
back
a
step
on
her
side
of
the
gate
with
staring
eyes
and
lips
drawn
thin
said
to
the
young
woman
are
ugly
uglier
than
you
used
to
be
and
you
were
always
very
ugly
are
even
uglier
than
animosity
expressed
by
such
a
scene
had
the
penetrating
quality
of
a
natural
force
and
it
gave
a
fund
of
energy
like
that
of
a
person
inspired
to
complete
some
great
and
universal
work
of
art
if
to
make
certain
that
would
be
unable
to
pay
any
settlement
at
all
wrote
to
prospective
clients
denouncing
him
she
also
went
to
and
appealed
to
of
the
from
whose
office
a
sympathetic
but
cautious
harrumphing
was
heard
after
overtures
to
accept
a
settlement
and
go
through
with
a
divorce
gave
a
ghastly
echo
of
by
suddenly
stating
will
never
leave
this
kind
of
pressure
it
is
not
surprising
that
would
make
sweeping
statements
to
the
newspapers
had
not
yet
goaded
him
into
mentioning
her
directly
but
one
can
feel
the
generalized
anger
in
remarks
to
reporters
when
he
was
asked
one
morning
on
arrival
in
what
he
thought
of
the
city
as
a
whole
said
he
was
choked
by
the
smoke
which
fortunately
kept
him
from
seeing
the
dreadful
town
surely
was
handsome
a
boulevard
a
racetrack
showing
that
automobiles
were
considered
to
be
a
danger
as
early
as
the
is
a
horrible
way
to
live
went
on
are
being
strangled
by
traffic
was
then
asked
for
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
and
began
to
talk
trenchant
sense
though
private
anguish
showed
through
in
the
vehemence
of
his
manner
a
gigantic
knife
and
sweep
it
over
the
said
off
every
building
at
the
seventh
floor
everything
out
need
concentration
you
cut
down
these
horrible
buildings
have
no
more
traffic
jams
have
trees
again
have
some
joy
in
the
life
of
this
city
all
the
job
of
the
architect
to
give
the
world
a
little
joy
enough
joy
was
afforded
in
the
spring
of
when
another
destructive
fire
broke
out
at
first
news
stories
had
it
that
this
blaze
was
started
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
as
though
could
call
down
fire
from
heaven
like
a
prophet
of
the
storm
did
take
place
that
night
and
fortunately
enough
it
included
a
cloudburst
that
helped
put
out
the
flames
accounts
blamed
defective
wiring
for
starting
the
fire
at
any
rate
heat
grew
so
intense
in
the
main
part
of
the
house
that
it
melted
the
window
panes
and
fused
the
pottery
to
cinders
set
his
loss
at
a
figure
perhaps
justified
by
the
unique
character
of
the
house
that
had
been
ruined
and
the
faultless
taste
that
had
gone
into
the
selection
of
the
prints
and
other
things
that
were
destroyed
spite
of
the
disaster
completed
during
this
period

for
the
resort
in
which
he
suggested
the
shapes
of
tepees

project
of
great
and
appropriate
charm

came
to
nothing

shortage
of
profitable
work

out
in
lonely
grandeur

quickly
melted
away
series
of
conferences
with
friends
and
bankers

about
this
time
and
the
question
before
these
meetings
was
here
is
a
man
of
international
reputation
and
proved
earning
power
how
can
he
be
financed
so
that
he
can
find
the
work

ought
to
do
this
was
under
consideration
dauntless
as
ever

about

for
the
new

got
on
paper
his
conception
of
a
cathedral
of
steel
and
glass
to
house
a
congregation
of
all
faiths
and
the
idea
for
a
planetarium
with
a
sloping
ramp
were
to
pass
before
these
plans
came
off
the
paper
and
was
justified
in
thinking
as
the
projects
failed
that
much
of
what
he
had
to
show
his
country
and
the
world
would
never
be
seen
except
by
visitors

was
some
question

out
that

useless

useless
bills
he
could

at

about
her

that

years
lived
across
the

came
that
was

merely
the
expression

of

knew
in

was
repulsed
at
the
locked
and
guarded
gates
likely
you
simply
told
yourself
as
you
handed
us
the
book
that
it
mattered
little
what
we
incanted
providing
we
underwent
the
discipline
of
incantation
sake
will
not
say
that
the
coy
and
leering
vade
mecum
of
those
verses
insinuated
itself
into
my
soul
that
particular
message
does
no
more
than
weakly
echo
the
roar
in
all
fresh
blood
what
you
could
not
know
of
course
was
how
smoothly
the
was
to
lead
into
an
of
my
own
vintage
under
whose
banner
we
adolescents
were
to
come
if
not
of
age
then
into
a
bright
taut
semblance
of
it
do
not
suppose
you
ever
heard
of
living
or
dead
and
moreover
do
not
suppose
that
even
if
you
had
his
legend
would
have
seemed
to
you
to
warrant
more
than
a
cluck
of
disapproval
his
appetites
his
exacerbations
nor
his
despair
were
kin
to
yours
might
have
been
the
man
in
the
moon
for
all
you
could
have
understood
him
he
was
no
man
in
the
moon
to
me
his
tender
nights
were
not
the
ones
dreamed
of
nor
was
it
for
yachts
sports
cars
tall
drinks
and
swimming
pools
nor
yet
for
money
or
what
money
buys
that
burned
too
was
burning
and
watching
myself
burn
flame
was
simply
of
a
different
kind
was
symbolized
at
least
for
those
of
us
who
recognized
ourselves
in
the
image
by
that
elegiac
candle
of
that
candle
which
from
the
quatrain
where
she
ensconced
it
became
a
beacon
to
us
but
which
in
point
of
fact
would
have
had
to
be
as
tall
as
a
funeral
taper
to
last
even
the
evening
let
alone
the
night
should
not
of
course
pluck
the
head
off
a
flower
and
expect
its
perfume
to
linger
on
this
passion
for
passion
now
that
look
back
on
it
with
passion
spent
seems
somewhat
overblown
and
operatic
though
as
a
diva
perfectly
controlled
her
notes
what
else
was
she
singing
but
the
old
of
that
most
ancient
of
tunes
that
nature
plays
with
such
unfailing
response
upon
young
nerves
this
is
not
so
little
the
mere
fact
that
by
plucking
on
the
nerves
nature
can
awaken
in
the
most
ordinary
of
us
temporarily
anyway
the
sleeping
poet
and
in
poets
can
discover
their
immortality
is
the
most
remarkable
of
all
the
remarkable
phenomena
to
which
we
can
attest
can
see
it
as
humiliating
that
an
extra
hormone
casually
fed
into
our
chemistry
may
induce
us
to
lay
down
our
lives
for
a
lover
or
a
friend
one
can
take
it
as
no
more
than
another
veil
torn
from
the
mystery
of
the
soul
it
could
also
be
looked
at
from
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
could
see
this
chemical
determinant
as
in
itself
a
miracle
any
case
bitterness
her
variations
on
the
theme
that
the
world
was
not
only
well
lost
for
love
but
even
well
lost
for
lost
love
her
constant
and
wonderfully
tragic
posture
so
unlike
that
of
since
it
required
no
scenery
or
props
drew
from
the
me
that
was
when
fell
upon
her
verses
an
overwhelming
yea
all
this
am
well
aware
is
the
bel
canto
of
love
and
although
have
always
liked
to
think
that
it
was
to
the
bel
canto
and
to
that
alone
that
listened
know
well
enough
that
it
was
not
am
to
speak
the
whole
truth
about
my
knowledge
of
love
will
have
to
stop
trying
to
emulate
the
transcendant
nightingale
is
another
side
of
love
more
nearly
symbolized
by
the
croak
of
the
mating
capercailzie
or
better
still
perhaps
by
the
mute
antics
of
the
slug
you
experienced
the
passion
of
desire
have
of
course
no
way
of
knowing
nor
indeed
have
wished
with
even
the
most
fleeting
fragment
of
a
wish
to
know
for
the
fact
that
one
constitutes
by
mere
existence
so
to
speak
the
proof
of
some
sort
of
passion
makes
any
speculation
upon
this
part
of
experience
more
immodest
more
scandalizing
more
deeply
unwelcome
than
an
obscenity
from
a
stranger
recoil
from
the
very
thought
the
same
time
am
aware
that
my
recoil
could
be
interpreted
by
readers
of
the
tea
leaves
at
the
bottom
of
my
psyche
as
an
incestuous
sign
since
theirs
is
a
science
of
paradox
if
one
hates
they
say
it
is
because
one
loves
if
one
bullies
they
say
it
is
because
one
is
afraid
if
one
shuns
they
say
it
is
because
one
desires
and
according
to
them
whatever
one
fancies
one
feels
what
one
feels
in
fact
is
the
opposite
normally
abnormal
or
normally
normal
neurotic
or
merely
fastidious
do
the
readers
by
the
way
allow
psyches
to
have
moral
taste
have
never
wanted
to
know
what
you
knew
of
passion
probably
would
not
remember
since
you
never
seemed
to
remember
even
the
same
moments
as
much
less
their
intensity
one
sunny
midday
on
when
you
had
set
out
with
me
for
some
final
shopping
less
than
a
week
before
the
wedding
you
staged
for
me
with
such
reluctance
at
the
can
see
us
now
had
been
walking
quite
briskly
for
despite
your
being
so
small
and
me
so
tall
your
stride
in
those
days
could
easily
match
mine
had
stopped
before
a
shop
window
to
assess
its
autumnal
display
when
you
suddenly
turned
to
me
looking
up
from
beneath
one
of
your
wrong
hats
and
with
your
nervous
ahem
are
things
must
tell
you
about
this
man
you
are
marrying
which
he
does
not
know
himself
you
had
screamed
right
there
in
the
street
where
we
stood
could
not
have
felt
more
fear
scarcely
a
mumble
of
excuse
fled
fled
however
not
from
what
might
have
been
the
natural
fear
of
being
unable
to
disguise
from
you
that
the
things
about
my
bridegroom
in
the
sense
you
meant
the
word
things
which
you
had
been
galvanizing
yourself
to
tell
me
as
a
painful
part
of
your
maternal
duty
were
things
which
had
already
insisted
upon
finding
out
for
myself
despite
may
now
say
the
unspeakable
awkwardness
of
making
the
discovery
on
principle
yes
on
principle
and
in
cold
blood
because
was
resolved
as
a
modern
woman
not
to
be
a
mollycoddle
waiting
for
but
to
seize
by
the
throat
had
developed
too
foolproof
a
facade
to
be
afraid
of
fled
from
was
my
fear
of
what
unwittingly
you
might
betray
without
meaning
to
about
my
father
and
yourself
can
see
from
this
latest
trick
of
memory
how
much
more
arbitrary
and
influential
it
is
than
the
will
my
memory
holds
with
relentless
tenacity
as
cannot
too
often
stress
to
my
wrongs
when
it
comes
to
my
shames
it
gestures
and
jokes
and
toys
with
chronology
like
a
prestidigitator
in
the
hope
of
distracting
me
from
them
as
was
about
to
enlarge
upon
my
discovery
of
the
underside
of
the
leaf
of
love
memory
displeased
at
being
asked
to
yield
its
unsavory
secrets
dashed
ahead
of
me
calling
back
over
its
shoulder
it
it
out
will
not
skip
it
or
cut
it
out
is
not
my
intention
in
this
narrative
to
picture
myself
as
a
helpless
victim
moored
to
the
rock
of
experience
and
left
to
the
buffetings
of
chance
to
be
innocent
is
to
be
helpless
then
had
been
as
are
we
all
helpless
at
the
start
the
time
came
when
was
no
longer
innocent
and
therefore
no
longer
helpless
in
that
sense
can
never
be
again
confess
my
hope
that
will
be
innocent
again
not
with
a
pristine
accidental
innocence
but
rather
with
an
innocence
achieved
by
the
slow
cutting
away
of
the
flesh
to
reach
the
bone
innocence
of
all
the
graces
of
the
spirit
is
believe
the
one
most
to
be
prayed
for
it
is
constantly
made
to
look
foolish
too
simple
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
people
say
who
have
found
in
the
innocent
an
impediment
it
does
not
mind
looking
foolish
because
it
is
not
concerned
with
how
it
looks
assumes
that
things
are
as
they
seem
when
they
seem
best
and
when
they
seem
worst
it
overlooks
them
innocence
a
word
given
is
a
word
that
will
be
kept
innocence
does
unto
others
as
it
expects
to
be
done
by
when
these
expectations
are
once
too
often
ground
into
the
dust
innocence
can
falter
since
its
strength
is
according
to
the
strength
of
him
who
possesses
it
innocence
of
which
speak
is
know
not
incorruptible
insist
upon
believing
that
even
when
it
is
lost
it
may
like
paradise
be
regained
it
was
not
of
innocence
in
general
that
was
speaking
but
of
perhaps
the
frailest
and
surely
the
least
important
side
of
it
which
is
innocence
in
romantic
love
if
anywhere
it
is
not
wholly
incontrovertible
you
for
instance
the
word
innocence
in
this
connotation
probably
retained
its
or
should
say
technical
sense
and
therefore
suppose
must
make
myself
quite
clear
by
saying
that
lost
or
rather
handed
over
what
you
would
have
considered
to
be
my
innocence
two
weeks
before
was
legally
entitled
and
in
fact
by
oath
required
to
hand
it
over
along
with
what
other
goods
and
bads
had
to
me
innocence
is
far
less
tangible
had
long
since
begun
to
lose
my
general
innocence
when
lost
my
trust
in
you
but
this
special
innocence
lost
before
ever
loved
through
my
discovery
that
one
could
tremble
with
desire
and
even
experience
a
flaming
delight
that
had
nothing
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
friendship
or
liking
let
alone
with
love
knew
this
knowledge
to
be
corrupting
at
the
time
acquired
it
today
these
many
years
later
after
all
the
temptations
resisted
or
yielded
to
the
weasel
satisfactions
and
the
engulfing
dissatisfactions
since
endured
call
it
corrupting
still
could
swear
to
it
remained
innocent
in
this
sense
until
the
end
but
not
mine
was
an
age
in
which
innocence
was
fostered
and
carefully
if
not
perhaps
altogether
innocently
preserved
had
grown
up
at
a
time
when
the
most
distinguishing
mark
of
a
lady
was
the
noli
me
tangere
writ
plain
across
her
face
because
of
the
particular
blot
on
your
family
escutcheon
through
what
may
only
have
been
one
unbridled
moment
on
your
part
and
because
you
had
the
kitchen
and
trundle
bed
of
your
childhood
to
outgrow
what
you
obviously
most
desired
with
both
your
conscious
and
unconscious
person
what
you
bent
your
whole
will
sensibility
and
intelligence
upon
was
to
be
a
lady
being
daughter
wife
or
mother
before
being
cultured
a
word
now
bereft
both
socially
and
politically
of
the
sheen
you
children
of
frontiersmen
bestowed
on
it
before
being
sorry
for
the
poor
progressive
about
public
health
and
prettily
if
somewhat
imprecisely
humanitarian
indeed
first
and
foremost
you
were
a
lady
was
of
course
more
to
the
portrait
of
a
lady
you
carried
in
your
eye
than
the
sine
qua
non
of
her
virtue
lady
you
made
clear
to
me
both
by
precept
and
example
never
raised
her
voice
or
slumped
in
her
chair
never
failed
in
social
tact
in
heaven
for
instance
would
not
mention
the
head
never
pouted
or
withdrew
or
scandalized
in
company
never
reminded
others
of
her
physical
presence
by
unseemly
sound
or
gesture
never
indulged
in
public
scenes
or
private
confidences
never
spoke
of
money
save
in
terms
of
alleviating
suffering
never
gossiped
or
maligned
never
stressed
but
always
minimized
the
hopelessness
of
anything
from
sin
to
death
itself
each
song
he
gave
verbal
footnotes
songs
sang
often
reminded
listeners
of
songs
of
a
kindred
character
they
knew
entirely
or
in
fragments
these
listeners
would
refer
to
persons
who
had
similar
ballads
or
ditties

with

however
to

as

no

rather
a

and
bashful
apostle
of

age
he
became
what
he
shyly
terms
a
pupil
of
the

of

about

thus
accepted
him

aspires

devour
his
energy
as
a
historian
a
poet
and
a
singer
cause
of
pessimism
was
the
fact
that
he
failed
to
learn
the
guitar
am
certain
that
will
not
fall
into
the

sad
philosophy

it

with

of

this
somewhat
distastefully

this

more

a

these

never
before
if
we

believe
that
the
industrial
countries
are
ready
to
participate
actively
in
supplementing
the
efforts
of
the
developing

to
achieve
progress
immediate
need
for
this
kind
of
is
underscored
by
the
strain
in
this
international
balance
of
payments
surplus
from
foreign
business
transactions
has
in
recent
years
fallen
substantially
short
of
the
expenditures
we
make
abroad
to
maintain
our
military
establishments
overseas
to
finance
private
investment
and
to
provide
assistance
to
the
less
developed
nations
our
deficit
in
balance
of
payments
approached
four
billion
dollars
deficits
of
anything
like
this
magnitude
would
over
time
impair
our
own
economic
growth
and
check
the
forward
progress
of
the
must
meet
this
situation
by
promoting
a
rising
volume
of
exports
and
world
trade
we
must
induce
all
industrialized
nations
of
the
to
work
together
to
help
lift
the
scourge
of
poverty
from
less
fortunate
in
this
matter
will
provide
both
for
the
necessary
sharing
of
this
burden
and
in
bringing
about
still
further
increases
in
mutually
profitable
trade
and
others
struggling
with
the
problems
of
development
will
progress
only
regardless
of
any
outside
help
if
they
demonstrate
faith
in
their
own
destiny
and
use
their
own
resources
to
fulfill
it
progress
in
a
national
transformation
can
be
only
gradually
earned
there
is
no
easy
and
quick
way
to
follow
from
the
oxcart
to
the
jet
plane
just
as
we
drew
on
for
assistance
in
our
earlier
years
so
now
do
these
new
and
emerging
nations
that
do
have
this
faith
and
determination
deserve
help
their
need
one
of
the
major
focal
points
of
our
concern
is
the
region
in
two
nations
alone
are
almost
five
hundred
million
people
all
working
and
working
hard
to
raise
their
standards
and
in
doing
so
to
make
of
themselves
a
strong
bulwark
against
the
spread
of
an
ideology
that
would
destroy
liberty
cannot
express
to
you
the
depth
of
my
conviction
that
in
our
own
and
free
world
interest
we
must
with
others
to
help
these
people
achieve
their
legitimate
ambitions
as
expressed
in
their
different
plans
the
and
other
instrumentalities
as
well
as
through
individual
action
by
every
nation
in
position
to
help
we
must
squarely
face
this
titanic
challenge
shall
continue
to
urge
the
people
in
the
interests
of
their
own
security
prosperity
and
peace
to
make
sure
that
their
own
part
of
this
great
project
be
amply
and
cheerfully
supported
world
decisions
in
this
matter
may
spell
the
difference
between
world
disaster
and
world
progress
in
freedom
countries
some
of
which
visited
last
month
have
similar
needs
common
meeting
ground
is
desirable
for
those
nations
which
are
prepared
to
assist
in
the
development
effort
the
past
year
have
discussed
this
matter
with
the
leaders
of
several
nations
of
its
wealth
of
experience
the
for
could
help
with
the
initial
studies
needed
goal
is
to
enlist
all
available
economic
resources
in
the
industrialized
especially
private
investment
capital
extending
this
help
we
hope
to
make
possible
the
enthusiastic
enrollment
of
these
nations
under
banner
more
startling
contrast
to
a
system
of
sullen
satellites
could
be
imagined
we
grasp
this
opportunity
to
build
an
age
of
productive
partnership
between
the
less
fortunate
nations
and
those
that
have
already
achieved
a
high
state
of
economic
advancement
we
will
make
brighter
the
outlook
for
a
world
order
based
upon
security
and
freedom
the
outlook
could
be
dark
indeed
face
indeed
what
may
be
a
turning
point
in
history
and
we
must
act
decisively
and
wisely
a
nation
we
can
successfully
pursue
these
objectives
only
from
a
position
of
broadly
based
strength
matter
how
earnest
is
our
quest
for
guaranteed
peace
we
must
maintain
a
high
degree
of
military
effectiveness
at
the
same
time
we
are
engaged
in
negotiating
the
issue
of
arms
reduction
tangible
and
mutually
enforceable
arms
reduction
measures
are
worked
out
we
will
not
weaken
the
means
of
defending
our
institutions
possesses
an
enormous
defense
power
is
my
studied
conviction
that
no
nation
will
ever
risk
general
war
against
us
unless
we
should
become
so
foolish
as
to
neglect
the
defense
forces
we
now
so
powerfully
support
is
knowledge
that
any
power
which
might
be
tempted
today
to
attack
the
by
surprise
even
though
we
might
sustain
great
losses
would
itself
promptly
suffer
a
terrible
destruction
once
again
assure
all
peoples
and
all
nations
that
the
except
in
defense
will
never
turn
loose
this
destructive
power
the
past
year
our
striking
power
unmatched
today
in
manned
bombers
has
taken
on
new
strength
as
the
intercontinental
ballistic
missile
has
entered
the
operational
inventory
fourteen
recent
test
launchings
at
ranges
of
five
thousand
miles
has
been
striking
on
an
average
within
two
miles
of
the
target
is
less
than
the
length
of
a
jet
runway
well
within
the
circle
of
destruction
there
was
an
firing
last
night
all
reports
so
far
received
its
performance
conformed
to
the
high
standards
have
just
described
performance
is
a
great
tribute
to
scientists
and
engineers
who
in
the
past
five
years
have
had
to
telescope
time
and
technology
to
develop
these
ballistic
missiles
where
had
none
before
year
moreover
growing
numbers
of
nuclear
powered
submarines
will
enter
our
active
forces
some
to
be
armed
with
missiles
remarkable
ships
and
weapons
ranging
the
oceans
will
be
capable
of
accurate
fire
on

virtually
anywhere
on

meet
situations
of
less
than
general
nuclear
war
we
continue
to
maintain
our
carrier
forces
our
many
service
units
abroad
our
always
ready
strategic
forces
and
divisions
and
the
civilian
components
continuing
modernization
of
these
forces
is
a
costly
but
necessary
process
is
scheduled
to
go
forward
at
a
rate
which
will
steadily
add
to
our
strength
deployment
of
a
portion
of
these
forces
beyond
our
shores
on
land
and
sea
is
persuasive
demonstration
of
our
determination
to
stand
with
our
allies
for
collective
security
have
directed
that
steps
be
taken
to
program
on
a
longer
range
basis
our
military
assistance
to
these

is
necessary

a
sounder
collective

to
our

in

exploration
which
is
often
mistakenly
supposed
to
be
an
integral
part
of

note
that

in

they

ultimate
benefit
of

our

so
successfully
does
not
suffer
from
our
present
lack
of
very
large
rocket
engines
which
are
necessary
in
distant

exploration
am
assured
by
experts
that
the

fully
adequate

is

in

that

to

the
continuous
strengthening

sinews

steady
purpose
of
our

is
to
assure
justice
before
for
every
individual
must
be
ever
alert
that
freedom
does
not
wither
through
the
careless
amassing
of

the

boldly
with

when
met
with

continue
to
be
afflicted
by
nagging
disorders
current
problems
that
require
solutions
participated
in
by
citizens
as
well
as
government
are
the
need
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
situations
of
prolonged
stalemate
the
persistent
refusal
to
come
to
grips
with
a
critical
problem
in
one
sector
of
agriculture
the
continuing
threat
of
inflation
together
with
the
persisting
tendency
toward
fiscal
irresponsibility
in
certain
instances
the
denial

some
of
our
citizens

a
fine
and
devoted

for
some
years
when

back
in

went
on

an
young
man

always
done
well
well
known
but
he
had
done
his
work
competently
had
received
courteously
and
they
were
discussing
the
case
know
the
lawyer
said
difficult
to
talk
like
this
about
a
man
who
answer
back

behind
a
desk
only
a
manila

him
sat
in
one
of
the
several

how
could
that
have
been
consider
that
he
was

and
we
carried
it
out
and
later
his

was
taken
up
by
the
have
nothing
to

did
our

and
and
myself
taking

from
a
number
of
people
did
you
think
about
his
mental
state
think
our
report
sums
up
our
finding

forget
here
was
a
man
who
had
been
accusing
his
colleagues
for
almost
a
year
of
willfully
attempting
to
present
an
incorrect
report
was
not
merely
alleging
errors
but
was
carried
out
by
allegations
in
memos
written
charges
of
serious
consequence
is
a
distressing
thing
you
or
were
being
accused
in
this
manner
and
yet
we
were
doing
our
level
best
to
carry
on
our
work
organization
can
carry
on
like
that
been
in
government
and
can
tell
some
pretty
hairy
stories
about
personnel
difficulties
so
know
what
a
problem
he
was
like
you
to
comment
on
is
the
criticism
leveled
at
your
do
you
mean
instance
regarding
the
fact
that
the
issued
two
interim
announcements
to
the
press
during
its
investigation
know
was
told
the
was
to
convey
its
views
suggestions
and
recommendations
to
the
his
own
words
took
it
for
granted
that
the
would
report
to
the
privately
and
not
in
public
claimed
that
the
release
of
the
preliminary
findings
was
prejudicial
to
his
position
bristled
an
instant
he
glared
speechless
at
he
said
thought
the
entire
report
was
going
to
be
confidential
from
beginning
to
end
you
know
launched
an
active
campaign
against
us
in
the
press
was
getting
so
that
we
the
were
being
tried
can
find
it
in
the
papers
as
a
matter
of
fact
looked
through
files
of
papers
for
and
found
a
great
deal
shot
another
look
at
necessarily
all
here
in
forget
the
foreign
press
what
about
the
second
interim
public
announcement
cited
aberrant
conduct
reason
for
that
report
was
to
settle
the
matter
of
the
list
far
as
concerned
it
was
a
separate
matter
from
the
general
study
of
conduct
fifteen
report
recommended
that
be
instructed
to
burn
the
list
the
papers
in
the
presence
of
a
about
your
press
conference
three
days
later
what
was
the
reason
for
that
said
you
told
correspondents
that
you
had
checked
in
advance
to
make
sure
the
term
aberrant
conduct
was
not
libelous
claimed
you
made
other
slanderous
allegations
paused
and
repeated
himself
entire
object
of
the
press
conference
was
to
clarify
the
problem
of
the
list
since
many
in
the
press
were
querying
the
about
it
was
the
list
know
never
explained
what
the
documents
or
papers
were
that
he
had
in
his
possession
was
foolish
of
him
to
keep
them
whatever
they
were
could
have
been
blackmailed
or
his
family
might
have
been
threatened
course
the
matter
caught
the
attention
attempted
to
conclude
this
and
did
so
by
having
the
papers
burned
like
the
way
it
was
carried
out
was
a
sort
of
affair
believes
the
is
an
organization
that
settles
matters
in
a
procedural
way
reflected
had
not
wanted
the
list
disposed
of
in
this
manner
and
if
had
not
wanted
it
who
had
ordered
it
concerning
the
formation
of
your

that
you
have
been
a

the
regular
legal

the
legal
chief
and
a
very
good
man
but
he
is
not
fully

on
some
technical
points
of

did
you
think
about
contention
of
errors
and
omissions
in
the
report
asked
answered
went
over
and
over
the
report
with
trying
to
check
them
out
after
the
incident
between
and

the
and
this
was
not

way

presented

pulled
out
two

an
article
on
the

from
the
other
was
by
in
the
pointed
to
the
story
know
a
friend
of
mine
probably
mean
to
write
it
this
way
or
maybe
he
did
any
violent
argument
between
and
as
the
puts
it
implies
that
was
on
the
enemy
side
see
what
mean
phrased
there
the
word
violent
case
was
that
came
up
to
claiming
he
had
found
further
errors
in
the
report
found
errors
and
want
you
to
look
them
over
once
again
had
to
argue
with
him
about
this
it
a
violent
discussion
after
all
this
went
over
all
that
had
brought
up
own
report
reflected
describes
the
encounter
as
immoderate
was
in
hysterical
condition
stopped
briefly
then
went
on

responsible
for
the
report
has
felt
terrible
about
all
this
was
a
good
report
he
did
all
he
could
to
make
it
a
good
report
speak
of
how
felt
know
well
forget
am
an
old
member
of
the
club
a
former
delegate
think
you
are
being
unfair
to
take
these
things
up
now
know
this
hits
in
many
areas
appeals
to
those
who
were
frustrated
in
the
outcome
of
the
situation

no
more

a
great

a
telegram
dated
to

in
part
the
matters
to
be

are
obviously
of
a
grave
character

therefore
respectfully
request
that

hearing
be

for
two
weeks

might

wished
to
pursue
in
the
course
of
this
review
questions
arising
from
the
body
of
material
already
in
its
possession
sounded
like
a
fair
enough
invitation
reflected
and
must
have
thought
so
too
because
on
the
thirteenth
he
met
the
group
of
three
on
the
floor
of

him

by
the
as

with
you
such
matters
as
appear

us
to
be
relevant

we
are
not

a
formal
group

a
committee
in
the
sense
of
being
guided
by
any
rules
or
regulations
of
the
only
rules
which
think
we
shall
follow
will
be
those
of
common
sense
justice
and
fairness
noted
that
had
later
referred
to
his
two
interviews
with
the
group
as
unfortunate
experiences
and
after
his
second
meeting
on
the
sixteenth
the
refused
to
attend
further
hearings
without
legal
counsel
pondered
the
reason
for
this
and
pondered
too
the
replacement
of
one
member
of
the
group
after
serving
one
week
left
for
the
hole
was
found
at
last
and
plugged
week
passed
and
even
the
missionaries
were
enjoying
the
voyage
sickness
was
gone
and
after
all
the
two
young
couples
were
on
their
honeymoon
only
lasting
difficulty
was
the
food
spite
of
explicit
instructions
regarding
variation
of
meals
the
food
did
not
seem
the
same
as
at
home
tasted
differently
from
what
it
does
on
land
and
those
things
was
most
fond
of
at
home
loathed
the
most
here
noted
last
they
concluded
that
the
heavy
full
feeling
in
their
stomachs
was
due
to
lack
of
exercise
was
the
remedy
they
decided
but
a
deck
full
of
chicken
coops
and
pigpens
was
hardly
suitable
was
the
alternative
rope
was
found
and
like
children
in
school
the
missionaries
skipped
for
hours
at
a
time
tiring
of
so
monotonous
a
form
of
exercise
they
decided
to
dance
instead

much
more
fun

the
girls
of
their
old
carefree
days

warmer

with
it
came
better

not
face
coffee
or
tea
without
milk
and
was
always
craving
types
of
food
that
were
not
available

a
sailing
ship

she
was
sure
she
was
going
to
have
a
baby

it
would
be

now

the
voyage
very
much
the
first
wave
of
homesickness
had
passed
although
there
were
moments
when
pointed
out
on
his
compass
the
direction
of
that
she
felt
a
little
twinge
at
her
heart
for
she
found
him
to
be
the
kindest
of
husbands
with
the
permission
of
who
usually
attended

of
his
officers

double
cabin

so
close
that

could
easily
be

after

finally
landing

not
how
soon
we
reach
and
are
placed
in
a
still
room
with
a
bowl
of

a
loaf
of
bread

hardly
think
of
this
simple
fare
without
exclaiming
oh
what
a
luxury
have
been
so
weary
of
the
excessive
rocking
of
the
vessel
and
the
almost
intolerable
smell
after
the
rain
that
have
done
little
more
than
lounge
on
the
bed
for
several
days
have
been
blest
with
excellent
spirits
and
have
been
running
about
the
deck
and
dancing
in
our
room
for
exercise
as
well
as
ever
studying
at
the
seminary
in
had
been
working
on
a
translation
from
the
original
had
brought
it
along
to
continue
during
the
voyage
was
one
particular
word
that
troubled
his
conscience
was
the
word
most
often
translated
as
baptism
a
he
had
been
baptized
as
a
tiny
baby
in
the
usual
manner
by
having
a
few
drops
of
water
sprinkled
on
his
head
yet
nowhere
in
the
whole
of
the
could
he
find
a
description
of
anybody
being
baptized
by
sprinkling
the
used
total
immersion
in
the
for
believers
even
was
baptized
by
this
method
more
looked
at
the
word
for
baptism
the
more
unhappy
he
became
over
its
true
meaning
was
only
natural
he
confided
his
searchings
to
conceding
ruefully
that
it
certainly
looked
as
if
their
own
were
wrong
and
the
right
was
very
troubled
this
time
she
had
learned
that
it
was
futile
to
argue
with
her
young
husband
yet
the
uncomfortable
fact
remained
the
were
sending
them
as
missionaries
to
the
and
paying
their
salaries
would
happen
if
changed
horses
in
midstream
and
in
were
on
friendly
terms
embarrassing
it
would
be
if
the
newly
appointed
missionaries
should
suddenly
switch
their
own
beliefs
in
order
to
embrace
teachings
you
become
a
will
not
informed
her
husband
but
sweeping
her
threat
aside
continued
to
search
for
an
answer
to
the
personal
dilemma
in
which
he
found
himself
early
they
were
a
hundred
miles
off
the
coast
of
by
which
time
all
four
missionaries
were
hardened
seafarers
could
boldly
write
know
not
how
it
is
but
hear
the
thunder
roll
see
the
lightning
flash
and
the
waves
threatening
to
swallow
up
the
vessel
and
yet
remain
unmoved
thrilled
to
the
sight
of
a
delicate
butterfly
and
two
strange
tropical
birds
was
near
and
on
one
hundred
and
fourteen
days
after
leaving
they
actually
saw
twenty
miles
away

coast

orders
for
the

services
of

reputable

for
days
for
such
a
man
but
was
lucky
day
a
ship
arrived
with
an
pilot
his
leadsman
an
youth
and
the
first
the

had
ever
seen
little
man
with
a
a
dark
copper
color
skin
he
was
wearing
calico
trousers
and
a
white
cotton
short
gown
was
plainly
disappointed
in
his
appearance
looks
as
feminine
as
you
can
imagine
she
decided
pilot
possessed
excellent
skill
at
his
calling
all
day
long
the
slowly
made
her
way
through
the
difficult
passages
to
consternation
his
language
while
thus
employed
left
much
to
be
desired
swore
so
loudly
at
the
top
of
his
voice
that
she
get
any
sleep
all
the
next
night
morning
the
was
out
of
the
treacherous
of
the
major
part
of

the
safety
of

oaths

fewer

moved
up

mouth
of
the
mighty

entranced
with
the
view
as
were
her
husband
and
friends
across
the
deck
which
was
empty
now
that
the
livestock
had
been
killed
and
eaten
they
sniffed
the
breezes
that
came
from
the
shore
each
pointing
out

extensive
and
bitter
attack
on
his
old
friend

time
as
we
shall
see
the
were
already
planning
to
punish
for
his
political
writing
by
expelling
him
from
the
of
his
defense
of
himself
in
the
final
paper
of
the

in
his
speech
before
the
their
efforts
were
successful
lost
his
seat
in
and
his
personal
quarrel
with
by
now
a
public
issue
thus
reached
its
climax
all
the
tracts
written
in
support
of

perhaps
the
most
significant
it
is
the
most
pretentious
and
elaborate
agents
assisted
in
promoting
circulation
said
to
have
reached
and
if
one
may
judge
by
the
reaction
of
and
other
government
writers
the
work
must
have
had
considerable
impact
main
business
here
is
to
arouse
public
opinion
to
the
immediate
danger
of
a
this
end
the
first
and
longest
section
of
the
tract
cites
all
the
laws
enacted
since
the
to
defend
against
the
of
a
his
comment
on
these
laws
sounds
all
the
usual
notes
of
current
propaganda
ranging
from
a
criticism
of
the
peace
to
an
attack
on
the
dismissal
of

his
principal
theme
is
that
the
intrigues
of
the
our
or
pose
an
immediate
threat
to
and
he
deplores
the
indifference
of
the
people
in
the
face
of
the
crisis
books
striking
at
the
he
complains
are
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
this
connection
too
is
drawn
in
for
attack
of
has
dared
to
drop
about
altering
the
his
effort
to
stir
the
public
from
its
lethargy
goes
so
far
as
to
list
atrocities
of
the
sort
to
be
expected
in
the
event
of
a
and
with
rousing
rhetoric
he
asserts
that
the
only
preservation
from
these
is
to
be
found
in
the
laws
he
has
so
tediously
cited
is
no
time
he
writes
to
talk
with

but
openly
and
honestly
to
profess
our

our
have
compleated
and
put
their
in
against
us
apparently
professed
his
sentiments
in
this
book
too
openly
and
honestly
for
his
own
good
since
the
government
was
soon
to
use
it
as
evidence
against
him
in
his
trial
before
the
the
final
issues
of
the
which
ended
just
as
the
new
session
of
began

provided
his
enemies
with
still
more
ammunition

printed
the
patent
giving
the
the
title
of
of
a
few
months
the
was
to
be
the
center
of
a
controversy
of
some
significance
on
the
touchy
question
of
the
the
order
of
the
the
agents
supported
by
the
leaders
demanded
that
a
writ
of
summons
be
issued
which
would
call
the
to
to

further
insuring

establishing
a

the
death
was
furious
and
advised
that
the
request
be
refused
realizing
that
the
law
required
the
issuance
of
the
writ
took
the
opposite
view
for
which
the
never
forgave
him
the
request
was
granted
but
the
himself
who
had
not
been
consulted
by
his
mother
rejected
the
proposal
and
recalled
his
agent
whose
impolitic
handling
of
the
affair
had
caused
the
interest
to
suffer
and
had
made
dismissal
more
likely
than
ever
in
this
paper
is
indicating
his
sympathy
for
such
a
plan
few
days
after
this
appeared
reported
to
that
was
expected
to
move
in

called
over

commented
they
that
young
into
would
show
themselves
quickly
for
they
are
not
to
want
only
a
head
to
a
beginning
final
issue
of
the
for
ran
to
some
length
and
was
printed
as
a
separate
pamphlet
entitled
the
of
the
purpose
is
to
present
a
general
defense
of
his
political
writing
and
a
resume
of
the
themes
which
had
occupied
him
in
the
but
there
is
much
here
also
which
bears
directly
on
his
personal
quarrel
with
he
complains
with
considerable
justice
that
the
writers
have
resorted
to
libel
instead
of
answering
his
arguments
birth
education
and
fortune
he
says
have
all
been
ridiculed
simply
because
he
has
spoken
with
the
freedom
of
an
and
he
assures
the
reader
that
whoever
talks
with
me
is
speaking
to
a
born
notable
examples
of
this
abuse
he
quotes
passages
from
the
that
of
all
things
and
of
which
he
here
attributes
to
put
in
rather
maudlin
terms
defense
of
himself
has
a
reasonable
basis
point
is
simply
that
the
have
showered
him
with
personal
satire
despite
the
fact
that
as
a
private
subject
he
has
a
right
to
speak
on
political
matters
without
affronting
the
prerogative
of
the
claims
too
that
his
political
convictions
are
simply
those
which
are
called
and
which
are
accepted
by
moderate
men
in
both
parties
final
section
of
this
pamphlet
is
of
special
interest
in
a
consideration
of
relations
with
purports
to
be
a
letter
from
to
a
friend
at
court
who
in
opinion
could
only
be
meant
as
first
answers
briefly
the
charges
which
his
dear
old
has
made
about
his
pamphlet
on
and
his
he
launches
into
an
attack
on
the
ministers
whom
he
calls
the
by
this
term
he
means
to
ridicule
their
professions
of
acting
in
the
interest
of
the
despite
their
own
education
and
manner
of
life
a
gibe
in
other
words
at
the
in
family
and
at
reputed
impiety
leaders
he
insinuates
are
cynically
using
the
as
a
political
to
increase
party
friction
and
keep
themselves
in
power
is
the
principal
point
made
in
this
final
section
of
and
it
caps
efforts
in
his
other
writing
of
these
months
to
counteract
the
notion
of

the
body
of
the
clergy

his
attention
to
the
he
is
addressing
explains
that
there
are
sometimes
honorable
courtiers
but
that
too
often
a
man
who
succeeds
at
court
does
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
his
and
nation
to
his
own
avarice
and
ambition
he
implies
is
the
case
with
his
friend
who
is
not
really
a
new
convert
himself
but
merely
a
favorer
of
new
converts
the
is
really
to
be
taken

on

that

almost
invariably
this
is
an
amazing

me
to

ridiculous

a

an

it

to
me
now

a

unusual
thing
for
a

the

would
like
to
believe
that
my

this
advancement
think
that

more
attention

sent
the
a
telegram
find
some
more
reporters
like
that
young
man
from
showed
this
wire
to
colonel
grunted
then
made
a
remark
which
might
be
construed
in
either
of
two
ways
bother
to
look
any
further
already
have
the
only
one
of
its
kind
did
have
friends
but
they
were
mostly
outside
the
newspaper
profession
of
soldier
was
one
of
them
was
another
used
to
go
with
to
call
on
the
eminent
neurologist
at
his
apartment
to
sit
among
the
excellent
collection
of
statues
paintings
and
books
and
drink
coffee
while
seemed
to
thaw
out
and
become
almost
affable
was
one
time
however
when
his
face
clouded
and
he
suddenly
blurted
did
my
brother
commit
suicide
cannot
remember
reply
if
indeed
he
made
one
she
were
not
at
home
would
see
to
it
that
a
fresh
white
rose
was
there
would
close
herself
in
the
on
the
second
floor
and
play
the
piano
she
had
brought
to
the
knew
she
was
playing
her
favorite
pieces
and
feeling
close
to
him
and
did
not
disturb
her
the
rest
of
the
days
in
the
would
be
shadowed
by
the
tragic
loss
even
though
the
tried
harder
than
ever
to
make
his
little
dry
jokes
and
to
tease
the
people
around
him
little
boy
came
to
give
the
his
personal
condolences
and
the
gave
word
that
any
little
boy
who
wanted
to
see
him
was
to
be
shown
in
the
maids
cried
a
little
over
that
and
the
standing
invitation
was
not
mentioned
to
was
even
more
generous
with
the
than
he
had
been
before
the
tragedy
would
bring
her
boxes
of
candy
and
other
presents
to
coax
a
smile
to
her
lips
brought
her
shawls
were
short
in
the
days
of
and
shawls
were
thrown
over
them
got
her
dozens
of
them
shawl
was
so
tremendous
that
she
could
not
wear
it
so
she
draped
it
over
the
banister
on
the
second
floor
and
it
hung
over
the
stairway
used
to
look
at
it
with
a
ghost
of
a
smile
spent
more
time
in
her
bedroom
among
her
doll
collection
kept
the
dolls
on
the
bed
night
when
would
turn
back
the
covers
she
would
have
to
take
all
the
dolls
off
the
bed
and
place
them
elsewhere
for
the
night
always
felt
that
the
collection
symbolized
wish
for
a
little
girl
the
dolls
was
one
that
meant
very
much
to
the
who
would
pick
it
up
and
look
at
it
often
had
a
tiny
envelope
tied
to
its
wrist
accompanying
sympathetic
letter
explained
that
inside
the
envelope
was
a
name
for
first
granddaughter
knew
this
doll
was
meant
to
help
overcome
her
grief
by
turning
her
eyes
to
the
future
name
inside
the
envelope
was
life
after
the
death
of
their
son
was
quieter
than
ever
was
away
at
school
most
of
the
time
would
knit
and
the
would
sit
reading
or
playing
with
the
many
pets
around
them
and
then
the
would
call
for
of
the
which
was
his
nickname
for
a
messenger
who
had
worked
in
the
since
administration
and
discuss
the
welfare
of
some
one
of
the
animals
was
part
of
work
to
look
after
the
dogs
dog
was
immortalized
in
a
painting
was
who
posed
with
for
the
portrait
by
get
him
to
pose
would
feed
him
candy
so
he
enjoyed
the
portrait
sessions
as
well
as
she
did
would
like
to
straighten
out
a
misconception
about
the
dress
is
wearing
in
this
painting
is
not
the
same
dress
as
the
one
on
her
manikin
in
the
think
the
dress
in
the
picture
was
lengthened
by
an
artist
much
later
on
is
not
true
dress
in
the
painting
is
a
bright
red
with
rhinestones
forming
a
spray
on
the
right
side
is
a
long
train
flowing
from
the
shoulders
gave
this
dress
for
me
and
wore
it
many
times
still
have
the
dress
and
hope
to
give
it
to
the
as
a
memento
or
as
more
fondly
hope
to
present
it
to
a
museum
containing
articles
showing
the
daily
lives
of
the
if
can
get
it
organized
to
get
back
to
the
household
so
obviously
loved
dogs
that
the
public
sent
her
more
dogs
and
last
two
were
a
red
and
a
black
chow
remained
boss
of
all
the
dogs
showed
them
what
to
do
and
taught
them
how
to
keep
the
maids
around
the
in
a
state
of
terror
dogs
would
run
through
the
halls
after
him
like
a
burst
of
bullets
and
all
the
maids
would
run
for
cover
know
what
to
do
whether
to
tell
on
or
not
since
she
had
the
ear
of
more
than
the
other
maids
she
was
afraid
the
would
not
understand
because
was
a
perfect
angel
with
the
day
when
the
took
his
nap
would
stretch
out
on
the
window
seat
near
him
like
a
perfect
gentleman
and
stare
thoughtfully
out
the
window
or
he
would
take
a
little
nap
himself
would
not
make
a
sound
until
the
had
wakened
and
left
for
the
office
then
he
would
bark
to
let
everyone
know
the
coast
was
clear
signal
was
for
the
other
dogs
to
come
running
but
it
was
also
the
signal
for
and
the
other
maids
to
watch
out
was
to
accompany
the
to
his
office
every
morning
was
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
this
mission
and
he
would
walk
in
front
of
the
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
dinner
lunch
or
breakfast
the
would
call
out
he
called
all
meals
supper
after
the
butler
had
announced
the
meal
the
dogs
would
dash
to
get
on
the
elevator
with
the
and
go
to
the
dining
room
would
all
lie
around
on
the
rug
during
the
meal
a
very
pretty
sight
as
and
were
all
and
were
too
young
to
be
trusted
in
the
dining
room
they
were
tied
to
the
radiator
with
their
leashes
and
they
would
cry
tried
to
talk
to
them
and
keep
them
quiet
while
she
tidied
up
the
sitting
room
before
the
returned
did
mention
to
that
she
felt
sorry
for
the
little
dogs
and
then
decided
to
leave
the
radio
on
for
them
while
she
was
gone
even
though
her
husband
disapproved
of
the
waste
of
electricity
was
now
the
first
maid
to
because
the
previous
first
maid
had
become
ill
and
died
chose
in
her
place
was
a
high
mark
for
seems
to
have
one
couple
upon
whom
it
relies
for
true
friendship
the
it
was
and
of
owners
of
a
large
department
store
seemed
to
be
at
the
half
the
time
butlers
were
amused
because
when
the
were
there
the
would
say
grace
at
breakfast
the
were
not
there
grace
would
be
omitted
of
breakfast
the
inaugurated
a
new
custom
that
of
conducting
business
at
the
breakfast
table
word
was
that
this
too
was
part
of
an
economy
move
on
his
part
new
bill
had
been
passed
under
that
designated
the
rather
than
the
as
the
for
official
meals
the
would
make
a
hearty
breakfast
official
by
inviting
officials
to
attend
caused
a
lot
of
talk
when
he
also
chose
the
breakfast
hour
to
have
the
barber
come
in
and
trim
his
hair
while
he
ate
said
that
if
were
supposed
to
be
colorful
certainly
made
a
good
president
knew
exactly
how
to
be
colorful
favorite
guest
of
the
house
as
far
as
the
staff
was
concerned
was
the
chewing
gum
king
had
chewing
gum
until
it
could
chew
no
more
and
every
sent
the
a
check
for
to
be
divided
among
all
the
help
can
imagine
that
he
got
pretty
good
service
good
friend

been
a
friend
of

and
continued
to
be
invited
by
the
first
royalty
whom
ever
waited
on
in
the
was
of
who
came
to
a
dinner
given
in
her
honor
on
was
not
an
overnight
guest
in
the
but
the
chief
usher
had
check
her
fur
coat
when
she
came
in
and
take
care
of
her
needs
said
she
was
one
of
the
prettiest
ladies
she
had
ever
seen
was
very
patriotic
and
one
of
the
duties
she
was
proudest
of
was
repairing
the
edges
of
the
flag
that
flew
above
the
two
flags
were
used
at
the
mansion
a
small
one
on
rainy
days
and
a
big
one
on
bright
days
wool
would
become
frazzled
around
the
edges
from
blowing
in
the
wind
and
would
mend
it
would
often
go
up
on
the
roof
to
see
the
attendant
take
down
the
flag
in
the
evening
used
to
tell
me
stand
there
and
look
at
the
flag
blowing
this
way
and
that
way
have
the
wonderful
safe
feeling
that
are
protected
no
matter
which
way
the
wind
blows
when
was
in
mourning
for
her
son
she
reached
out
to
help
other
people
in
trouble
person
she
helped
was
my
brother
had
told
her
how
lungs
had
been
affected
when
he
was
gassed
in
the
war
was
in
and
out
of
for
veterans
any
number
of
times
a
personal
interest
she
had
the
doctor
assigned
to
the
look
over
a
result
he
was
sent
to
a
hospital
in
until
his
health
improved
enough
for
him
to
come
back
to
to
work
in
the
service
again
there
was
danger
that
his
lungs
would
suffer
in
the
muggy
weather
and
he
had
to
return
to
the
dry
climate
of
the
to
live
and
work
was
in
mourning
she
did
not
wear
black
wore
grey
every
day
and
white
every
evening
knew
that
she
was
out
of
mourning
when
she
finally
wore
bright
colors
helped
her
a
lot
by
selecting
some
lovely
colored
dresses
to
get
her
started
opened
the
boxes
with
a
tear
in
her
eye
and
a
sad
smile
on
her
face
the
social
side
the
chore
had
at
the
formal
receptions
at
the
thrilled
her
the
most
was
her
job
to
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
just
as
the
stepped
off
the
last
tread
would
straighten
out
her
long
train
before
she
marched
to
the
to
greet
her
guests
with
the
would
enjoy
the
sight
of
the
famous
guests
as
much
as
anyone
and
would
note
a
gown
here
and
there
to
tell
me
about
that
night
night
came
home
practically
in
a
state
of
shock
had
stood
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
as
usual
when
came
down
in
the
same
dress
that
is
now
in
the
to
greet
her
guests
stooped
down
to
fix
the
train
but
there
was
no
train
there
reached
and
reached
around
the
dress
but
there
was
nothing
there
looked
up
and
saw
that
without
knowing
it
was
holding
it
aloft
looked
down
saw
horrified
expression
and
quickly
let
the
whole
thing
fall
to
the
floor
swirled
the
train
in
place
and
not
a
step
was
lost
did
not
always
live
at
the
during
the
as
this
enumeration
is
it
barely
hints
at
the
diverse
perceptions
of
collectively
or
individually
that
have
been
attested
by
their
environment
is
reasonable
to
affirm
two
propositions
have
been
perceived
by
as
all
things
to
all
men
some
have
in
fact
been
all
things
to
all
men
the
arena
of
power
have
at
one
time
or
another
been
ally
they
have
observed
correct
neutrality
they
have
been
enemy
the
market
place
have
in
fact
under
various
circumstances
been
valued
customers
and
suppliers
or
clannish
monopolists
and
cutthroat
competitors
so
on
through
the
roles
referred
to
in
the
previous
paragraph
of
perception
yes
diversity
of
fact
yes
the
two
do
not
invariably
or
even
typically
coincide
conventional
image
of
a
particular
time
and
place
is
not
necessarily
congruent
with
the
image
of
the
facts
as
established
over
the
years
by
scholarly
and
scientific
research
images
of
have
this
in
common
with
all
perceptions
of
a
configuration
in
which
one
feature
is
held
constant
images
can
be
both
true
and
false
genuinely
interesting
question
then
becomes
factors
determine
the
degree
of
realism
or
distortion
in
conventional
images
of
working
test
of
the
facts
must
always
be
the
best
available
description
obtainable
from
scholars
and
scientists
who
have
applied
their
methods
of
investigation
to
relevant
situations
such
functional
images
are
subject
to
human
error
they
are
in
the
sense
that
they
are
subject
to
disciplined
procedures
that
check
and
recheck
against
error
accounting
for
realism
or
distortion
two
sets
of
factors
can
be
usefully
distinguished
current
intelligence
predispositions
regarding
intelligence
may
have
been
the
victim
of
false
information
in
the
instance
reported
in
this
book
if
so
he
would
not
be
the
first
or
last
commanding
officer
who
has
succumbed
to
bad
information
and
dubious
estimates
of
the
future
may
have
been
may
have
entered
the
situation
with
predispositions
that
prepared
him
to
act
uncritically
in
the
press
of
affairs
in
turn
fall
conveniently
into
two
categories
for
purposes
of
analysis
some
extent
predispositions
are
shaped
by
exposure
to
group
environments
some
measure
they
depend
upon
the
structure
of
individual
personality
of
owed
something
to
his
exposure
to
the
ideology
of
politically
successful
socialist
movement
in
millions
of
human
beings
were
exposed
to
propaganda
and
record
allowing
for
group
exposures
it
is
apparent
that
other
factors
must
be
considered
if
we
are
to
comprehend
fanaticism
are
personality
factors
they
include
harmonies
and
conflicts
within
the
whole
man
and
mechanisms
whereby
inner
components
are
more
or
less
smoothly
met
psychiatric
knowledge
provides
us
with
many
keys
to
unlock
the
significance
of
behavior
of
the
kind
foregoing
factors
are
pertinent
to
the
analysis
of
perceptual
images
and
the
broad
conditions
under
which
they
achieve
realism
or
fall
short
of
it
one
merit
of
the
vast
panorama
of
conceptions
of
the
unfolded
in
the
present
anthology
is
that
it
provides
a
formidable
body
of
material
that
invites
critical
examination
in
terms
of
reality
selections
are
themselves
convincing
contributions
to
this
appraisal
however
the
significance
of
the
volume
is
greater
than
the
foregoing
paragraphs
suggest
as
a
believe
that
its
primary
contribution
is
in
the
realm
of
future
policy
we
can
neither
undo
nor
redo
the
past
we
are
limited
to
the
events
of
today
and
tomorrow
this
domain
the
simple
fact
of
coexistence
in
the
same
local
national
and
world
community
is
enough
to
guarantee
that
we
cannot
refrain
from
having
some
effect
large
or
small
upon
relations
shall
these
effects
be
am
deliberately
raising
the
policy
problems
involved
in
relations
examination
of
any
policy
question
calls
for
the
performance
of
the
intellectual
tasks
inseparable
from
any
method
tasks
are
briefly
indicated
by
these
questions
are
my
goals
in
relations
are
the
historical
trends
in
this
country
and
abroad
in
the
extent
to
which
these
goals
are
effectively
realized
factors
condition
the
degree
of
realization
at
various
times
and
places
is
the
probable
course
of
future
developments
policies
if
adopted
and
applied
in
various
circumstances
will
increase
the
likelihood
that
future
events
will
coincide
with
desired
events
and
do
so
at
least
cost
in
terms
of
all
human
values
is
beyond
the
province
of
this
epilogue
to
cover
policy
questions
of
such
depth
and
range
discussion
is
therefore
limited
to
a
suggested
procedure
for
realizing
at
least
some
of
the
potential
importance
of
this
volume
for
future
policy
a
groundwork
for
the
proposal
give
some
attention
to
the
first
task
enumerated
above
the
clarification
of
goal
reply
is
that
associate
myself
with
all
those
who
affirm
that
relations
should
contribute
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
human
dignity
basic
goal
finds
partial
expression
in
the
of
a
statement
initiated
and
endorsed
by
individuals
and
organizations
of
many
religious
and
philosophical
traditions
this
frame
of
reference
policies
appropriate
to
claims
advanced
in
the
name
of
the
depend
upon
which
identity
is
involved
as
well
as
upon
the
nature
of
the
claim
the
characteristics
of
the
claimant
the
justifications
proposed
and
the
predispositions
of
the
community
decision
makers
who
are
called
upon
to
act
are
identified
as
a
religious
body
in
a
controversy
that
comes
before
a
national
or
international
tribunal
it
is
obviously
compatible
with
the
goal
of
human
dignity
to
protect
freedom
of
worship
decision
makers
act
within
this
frame
they
determine
whether
a
claim
put
forward
in
the
name
of
religion
is
to
be
accepted
by
the
larger
community
as
appropriate
to
religion
the
recognition

skill
moments
of
intense
crisis
the
responsibility
of
political
leaders
is
overwhelming

freedom
of

is
limited
by
the
pattern
of
predisposition
with
which
they
and

people
around

enter

critical
moments
predispositions
favorable

dignity

obviously
pay
off

test

destructive
of

personality

sinister
impact
with
the
result
that
men
of
good
will
are
often
trapped
and
nullified
measures
in
anticipation
of
crisis

plans
to
inject

cognizant

the
corrosive
effect
of
crisis

are
also
able
to
raise
calm
and
realistic
voices

overburdened
leaders
near
the
limit
of
are
learning
how
to
do
these
things
in
some
of
the
vast
organized
structures
of
modern
society

process
can
be
accelerated
truism
is
that
the
time
to
prepare
for
the
worst
is
when
times
are
best
intercrisis
periods
the
educational
facilities
of
the
community
have
the
possibility
of
remolding
the
perspectives
and
altering
the
behavior
of
vast
numbers
of
human
beings
of
every
age
and
condition
more
men
and
women
are
made
capable
of
living
up
to
the
challenge
of
decency
the
chances
are
improved
that
the
pattern
of
predisposition
prevailing
in
positions
of
strength
in
future
crises
can
be
favorably
affected
an
abiding
difficulty
of
paragraphs
like
the
foregoing
is
that
they
appear
to
preach
and
in
contemporary
society
we
often
complain
of
too
much
reaffirmation
of
the
goodness
of
the
good
any
case
do
not
intend
to
let
the
present
occasion
pass
without
dealing
more
directly
with
the
problem
of
implementing
good
intentions
assume
that
the
number
of
readers
of
this
anthology
who
regard
themselves
as
morally
perfect
is
small
and
that
most
readers
are
willing
to
consider
procedures
by
which
they
may
gain
more
insight
into
themselves
and
better
understanding
of
others
used
the
present
book
is
an
excellent
instrument
of
enlightenment
us
not
confuse
the
issue
by
labeling
the
objective
or
the
method
psychoanalytic
for
this
is
a
well
established
term
of
art
for
the
specific
ideas
and
procedures
initiated
by
and
his
followers
for
the
study
and
treatment
of
disordered
personalities
traditional
method
proceeds
by
the
technique
of
free
association
punctuated
by
interpretations
proposed
by
the
psychoanalytic
interviewer
we
have
in
mind
does
have
something
in
common
with
the
goals
of
psychoanalysis
and
with
the
methods
by
which
they
are
sought
what
we
propose
however
a
psychoanalyst
is
not
necessary
even
though
one
aim
is
to
enable
the
reader
to
get
beneath
his
own
defenses
his
defenses
of
himself
to
himself
this
purpose
a
degree
of
intellectual
and
emotional
involvement
is
necessary
but
involvement
needs
to
be
accompanied
by
a
special
frame
of
mind
relatively
long
and
often
colorful
selections
in
this
anthology
enable
the
reader
to
become
genuinely
absorbed
in
what
is
said
whether
he
responds
with
anger
or
applause
simple
involvement
is
not
enough
calls
for
an
open
permissive
inquiring
posture
of
symposium
provides
an
opportunity
to
confront
the
self
with
specific
statements
which
were
made
at
particular
times
by
identifiable
communicators
who
were
addressing
definite
audiences
and
throughout
several
hundred
pages
everyone
is
talking
about
the
same
key
symbol
of
identification
advantage
of
being
exposed
to
such
specificity
about
an
important
and
recurring
feature
of
social
reality
is
that
it
can
be
taken
advantage
of
by
the
reader
to
examine
covert
as
well
as
overt
resonances
within
himself
resonances
triggered
by
explicit
symbols
clustering
around
the
central
figure
of
the
facets
of
this
aspect
of
the
literary
process
have
special
significance
for
our
time
a
reservation
on
the
point
have
just
made
is
the
phenomenon
of
and
which
discussed
in
essence
this
involves
grounding
thought
and
emotion
in
the
values
and
experience
of
others
rather
than
in
own
values
and
experience
is
a
risk
that
instead
of
teaching
a
person
how
to
be
himself
reading
fiction
and
drama
may
teach
him
how
to
be
somebody
else
what
the
person
brings
to
the
reading
is
important
if
the
critic
instructs
his
audience
in
what
to
see
in
a
work
he
is
contributing
to
this
if
he
instructs
them
in
how
to
evaluate
a
work
he
is
helping
them
to
achieve
their
own
identity
second
timely
part
of
this
sketch
of
literature
and
the
search
for
identity
has
to
do
with
the
difference
between
good
and
enduring
literary
works
and
the
ephemeral
mass
culture
products
of
today
the
range
and
variety
of
characters
who
in
their
literary
lives
get
along
all
right
with
life
styles
one
never
imagined
possible
there
is
an
implicit
lesson
in
differentiation
reader
observing
this
process
might
ask
why
not
be
different
find
in
the
answer
a
license
to
be
a
variant
of
the
human
species
observer
of
television
or
other
products
for
a
mass
audience
has
only
a
permit
to
be
like
the
models
he
sees
even
more
like
everybody
else
this
think
holds
for
values
as
well
as
life
styles
would
need
to
test
this
proposition
carefully
after
all
the
large
and
probably
unreliable
literature
on
the
most
unforgettable
character
ever
met
deals
with
village
grocers
country
doctors
favorite
if
illiterate
aunts
and
so
forth
often
turn
out
to
be
idiosyncratic
too
still
the
proposition
is
worth
examination
is
possible
that
the
study
of
literature
affects
the
conscience
the
morality
the
sensitivity
to
some
code
of
right
and
wrong
do
not
know
that
this
is
true
both
and
deal
with
the
development
and
nature
of
conscience
as
do
such
theologians
as
and
forms
the
core
of
many
perhaps
most
problems
of
psychotherapy
am
not
aware
of
great
attention
by
any
of
these
authors
or
by
the
psychotherapeutic
profession
to
the
role
of
literary
study
in
the
development
of
conscience
most
of
their
attention
is
to
a
period
of
life
or
for
the
theologians
of
course
to
the
influence
of
religion
it
would
be
surprising
if
what
one
reads
did
not
contribute
to
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
certainly
the
awakened
alarm
over
the
comic
books
and
the
continuous
concern
over
prurient
literature
indicate
some
peripheral
aspects
of
this
influence
the
most
important
thing
to
focus
on
is
not
the
development
of
conscience
which
may
well
be
almost
beyond
the
reach
of
literature
but
the
contents
of
conscience
the
code
which
is
imparted
to
the
developed
or
immature
conscience
available
is
in
large
part
a
code
of
behavior
and
a
glossary
of
values
what
is
it
that
people
do
and
should
do
and
how
one
should
regard
it
a
small
way
this
is
illustrated
by
the
novelist
who
argued
for
the
powerful
influence
of
literature
as
a
teacher
of
society
and
who
illustrated
this
with
the
way
a
girl
learned
to
meet
her
lover
how
to
behave
how
to
think
about
this
new
experience
how
to
exercise
restraint
may
be
said
to
give
people
a
sense
of
purpose
dedication
mission
significance
no
doubt
is
part
of
what
implies
when
he
says
of
the
arts
give
form
and
meaning
to
life
which
might
otherwise
seem
shapeless
and
without
sense
seem
almost
universally
to
want
a
sense
of
function
that
is
a
feeling
that
their
existence
makes
a
difference
to
someone
living
or
unborn
close
and
immediate
or
generalized
useless
seems
generally
to
be
an
unpleasant
sensation
need
so
deeply
planted
asking
for
direction
so
to
speak
is
likely
to
be
gratified
by
the
vivid
examples
and
heroic
proportions
of
literature
terms
renewal
and
refreshed
which
often
come
up
in
aesthetic
discussion
seem
partly
to
derive
their
import
from
the
renewal
of
purpose
and
a
refreshed
sense
of
significance
a
person
may
receive
from
poetry
drama
and
fiction
notion
of
inspiration
is
somehow
cognate
to
this
feeling
literature
does
this
or
for
whom
is
certainly
not
clear
but
the
content
form
and
language
of
the
message
as
well
as
the
source
would
all
play
differentiated
parts
in
giving
and
molding
a
sense
of
purpose
of
the
most
salient
features
of
literary
value
has
been
deemed
to
be
its
influence
upon
and
organization
of
emotion
us
differentiate
a
few
of
these
ideas
notion
of
catharsis
the
purging
of
emotion
is
a
persistent
and
viable
one
idea
here
is
one
of
discharge
but
this
must
stand
in
opposition
to
a
second
view
notion
of
the
arousal
of
emotion
third
idea
is
that
artistic
literature
serves
to
reduce
emotional
conflicts
giving
a
sense
of
serenity
and
calm
to
individuals
is
given
some
expression
in
notion
of
harmony
and
the
resolution
of
indecision
fourth
view
is
the
transformation
of
emotion
as
in
fine
phrase
on
the
arts
they
transform
and
beautify
our
inner
nature
is
possible
that
the
idea
of
enrichment
of
emotion
is
a
fifth
idea
in
his
discussion
of
suggests
this
of
the
things
which
makes
our
lives
drab
and
empty
and
which
leaves
us
at
the
end
of
the
day
fatigued
and
deflated
spiritually
is
the
pressure
of
the
taxing
practical
utilitarian
concern
of
objects
art
is
to
release
us
from
these
postulated
things
things
we
must
think
symbolically
about
and
bring
us
back
to
the
ineffable
beauty
and
richness
of
the
aesthetic
component
of
reality
in
its
immediacy
it
must
sever
its
connection
with
these
common
sense
entities
take
the
central
meaning
here
to
be
the
contrast
between
the
drab
empty
quality
of
life
without
literature
and
a
life
enriched
by
it
view
of
the
aesthetic
experience
might
constitute
a
sixth
variety
for
him
it
constitutes
in
part
the
organization
of
impulses
sketch
of
the
emotional
value
of
the
study
of
literature
would
have
to
take
account
of
all
of
these
there
is
one
in
particular
which
it
seems
to
me
deserves
special
attention
the
wide
range
of
experiences
common
to
our
race
none
is
more
difficult
to
manage
more
troublesome
and
more
enduring
in
its
effects
than
the
control
of
love
and
hate
study
of
literature
contributes
to
this
control
in
a
curious
way
and
it
seems
to
me
have
a
penetrating
insight
into
the
way
in
which
this
control
is
effected
if
we
say
poetry
is
to
talk
of
beauty
and
love
and
yet
not
aim
at
exciting
erotic
emotion
or
even
an
emotion
of
esteem
and
if
it
is
to
talk
of
anger
and
murder
and
yet
not
aim
at
arousing
anger
and
indignation
then
it
may
be
that
the
poetic
way
of
dealing
with
these
emotions
will
not
be
any
kind
of
intensification
compounding
or
magnification
or
any
direct
assault
upon
the
affections
at
all
indirect
mixed
reconciling
tensional
might
well
be
the
stratagem
the
devious
technique
by
which
a
poet
indulged
in
all
kinds
of
talk
about
love
and
anger
and
even
in
something
like
expressions
of
these
emotions
without
aiming
at
their
incitement
or
even
uttering
anything
that
essentially
involves
their
incitement
rehearsal
through
literature
of
emotional
life
under
controlled
conditions
may
be
a
most
valuable
human
experience
do
not
mean
catharsis
the
discharge
of
emotion
mean
something
more
like
concept
of
the
utility
of
play
to
a
small
child
he
plays
house
or
doctor
or
fireman
as
a
way
of
mastering
slightly
frightening
experiences
reliving
them
imaginatively
until
they
are
under
control
is
a
second
feature
of
the
influences
of
literature
good
literature
on
emotional
life
which
may
have
some
special
value
for
our
time
portrayal
of
the
underprivileged
and
undereducated
youth
of
a
salient
finding
was
the
inability
to
postpone
gratification
a
need
to
satisfy
impulses
immediately
without
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
or
of
savoring
the
experience
it
is
only
an
analogy
but
one
of
the
most
obvious
differences
between
cheap
fiction
and
fiction
of
an
enduring
quality
is
the
development
of
a
theme
or
story
with
leisure
and
anticipation
who
has
watched
children
develop
a
taste
for
literature
will
understand
what
mean
is
at
least
possible
that
the
capacity
to
postpone
gratification
is
developed
as
well
as
expressed
in
a
continuous
and
guided
exposure
to
great
literature
any
inquiry
into
the
way
in
which
great
literature
affects
the
emotions
particularly
with
respect
to
the
sense
of
harmony
or
relief
of
tension
or
sense
of
a
transformed
inner
nature
which
may
occur
a
most
careful
exploration
of
the
particular
feature
of
the
experience
which
produces
the
effect
would
be
required
the
calm
which
follows
the
reading
of
a
poem
for
example
is
the
effect
produced
by
the
enforced
quiet
by
the
musical
quality
of
words
and
rhythm
by
the
sentiments
or
sense
of
the
poem
by
the
associations
with
earlier
readings
if
it
is
familiar
by
the
boost
to
the
for
the
by
the
diversion
of
attention
by
the
sense
of
security
in
a
legitimized
withdrawal
by
a
kind
license
for
some
variety
of
fantasy
life
regarded
as
forbidden
or
by
ideas
about
the
magical
power
of
words
are
if
the
research
is
done
with
subtlety
and
skill
researchable
topics
but
the
research
is
missing
of
the
most
frequent
views
of
the
value
of
literature
is
the
education
of
sensibility
that
it
is
thought
to
provide
is
a
vague
word
covering
an
area
of
meaning
rather
than
any
precise
talent
quality
or
skill
other
things
it
means
perception
discrimination
sensitivity
to
subtle
differences
the
extent
to
which
this
is
true
and
the
limits
of
the
field
of
perceptual
skill
involved
should
be
acknowledged
truth
is
illustrated
by
the
skill
sensitivity
and
general
expertise
of
the
professor
with
whom
one
attends
the
theatre
limits
are
suggested
by
an
imaginary
experiment
contrast
the
perceptual
skill
of
professors
with
that
of
their
colleagues
in
discriminating
among
motor
cars
political
candidates
or
female
beauty
these
lines
the
particular
point
that
sensitivity
in
literature
leads
to
sensitivity
in
human
relations
would
require
more
proof
than
have
seen
a
symposium
and
general
exploration
of
the
field
of
and
the
discussion
does
not
touch
upon
this
aspect
of
the
subject
with
one
possible
exception
shows
the
transcultural
stability
of
metaphors
based
on
sensation
hot
sweet
bitter
dealing
with
personal
qualities
of
human
beings
and
events
to
go
from
here
to
the
belief
that
those
more
sensitive
to
metaphor
and
language
will
also
be
more
sensitive
to
personal
differences
is
too
great
an
inferential
leap
would
say
too
that
the
study
of
literature
tends
to
give
a
person
what
shall
call
depth
use
this
term
to
mean
three
things
a
search
for
the
human
significance
of
an
event
or
state
of
affairs
a
tendency
to
look
at
wholes
rather
than
parts
and
a
tendency
to
respond
to
these
events
and
wholes
with
feeling
is
the
obverse
of
triviality
shallowness
emotional
anaesthesia
think
these
attributes
cluster
but
have
no
evidence
fact
can
only
say
this
seems
to
me
to
follow
from
a
wide
continuous
and
properly
guided
exposure
to
literary
art
late
a
philosopher
whose
work
has
proved
helpful
to
many
students
of
literature
once
wrote
are
all
though
many
of
us
are
snobbish
enough
to
wish
to
deny
it
in
far
closer
sympathy
with
the
art
of
the
and
than
with
and
or
even
and
an
effort
of
historical
sympathy
we
can
cast
our
minds
back
into
the
art
of
a
remote
past
or
an
alien
present
and
enjoy
the
carvings
of
cavemen
and
but
the
possibility
of
this
effort
is
bound
up
with
that
development
of
historical
thought
which
is
the
greatest
achievement
of
our
civilization
in
the
last
two
centuries
and
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
people
in
whom
this
development
has
not
taken
place
natural
and
primary
aesthetic
attitude
is
to
enjoy
contemporary
art
to
despise
and
dislike
the
art
of
the
recent
past
and
wholly
to
ignore
everything
else
might
argue
that
the
ultimate
purpose
of
literary
scholarship
is
to
correct
this
spontaneous
provincialism
that
is
likely
to
obscure
the
horizons
of
the
general
public
of
the
newspaper
critic
and
of
the
creative
artist
himself
results
a
study
of
literature
freed
from
the
tyranny
of
the
contemporary
study
may
take
many
forms
study
of
ideas
in
literature
is
one
of
these
course
it
goes
without
saying
that
no
student
of
ideas
can
justifiably
ignore
the
contemporary
scene
will
frequently
return
to
it
continuities
contrasts
and
similarities
discernible
when
past
and
present
are
surveyed
together
are
inexhaustible
and
the
one
is
often
understood
through
the
other
we
assert
the
value
of
such
study
we
find
ourselves
committed
to
an
important
assumption
students
of
literature
whether
they
call
themselves
scholars
or
critics
are
ready
to
argue
that
it
is
possible
to
understand
literary
works
as
well
as
to
enjoy
them
will
add
that
we
may
find
our
enjoyment
heightened
by
our
understanding
understanding
of
course
may
in
its
turn
take
many
forms
and
some
of
these
especially
those
most
interesting
to
the
student
of
comparative
literature
are
essentially
historical
the
historian
of
literature
need
not
confine
his
attention
to
biography
or
to
stylistic
questions
of
form
texture
or
technique
may
also
consider
ideas
is
true
that
this
distinction
between
style
and
idea
often
approaches
the
arbitrary
since
in
the
end
we
must
admit
that
style
and
content
frequently
influence
or
interpenetrate
one
another
and
sometimes
appear
as
expressions
of
the
same
insight
in
general
we
may
argue
that
the
student
can
direct
the
primary
emphasis
of
his
attention
toward
one
or
the
other
this
point
a
working
definition
of
idea
is
in
order
although
our
first
definition
will
have
to
be
qualified
somewhat
as
we
proceed
term
idea
refers
to
our
more
reflective
or
thoughtful
consciousness
as
opposed
to
the
immediacies
of
sensuous
or
emotional
experience
is
through
such
reflection
that
literature
approaches
philosophy
idea
let
us
say
may
be
roughly
defined
as
a
theme
or
topic
with
which
our
reflection
may
be
concerned
this
essay
we
are
along
with
most
historians
interested
in
the
more
general
or
more
inclusive
ideas
that
are
so
to
speak
writ
large
in
history
of
literature
where
they
recur
continually
among
these
is
the
idea
of
human
nature
itself
including
the
many
definitions
that
have
been
advanced
over
the
centuries
also
secondary
notions
such
as
the
perfectibility
of
man
the
depravity
of
man
and
the
dignity
of
man
might
indeed
argue
that
the
history
of
ideas
in
so
far
as
it
includes
the
literatures
must
center
on
characterizations
of
human
nature
and
that
the
great
periods
of
literary
achievement
may
be
distinguished
from
one
another
by
reference
to
the
images
of
human
nature
that
they
succeed
in
fashioning
need
not
to
be
sure
expect
to
find
such
ideas
in
every
piece
of
literature
idea
of
the
sort
that
we
have
in
mind
although
of
necessity
readily
available
to
imagination
is
more
general
in
connotation
than
most
poetic
or
literary
images
especially
those
appearing
in
lyric
poems
that
seek
to
capture
a
moment
of
personal
experience
love
is
like
a
red
red
rose
and
plumed
purple
of
although
clearly
intelligible
in
content
hardly
present
ideas
of
the
sort
with
which
we
are
here
concerned
the
other
hand
unplumbed
salt
estranging
sea
taken
in
its
context
certainly
does
so
a
work
of
art
involves
recognition
of
the
ideas
that
it
reflects
or
embodies
the
student
of
literature
may
sometimes
find
it
helpful
to
classify
a
poem
or
an
essay
as
being
in
idea
or
in
ideal
content
or
subject
matter
typical
or
atypical
of
its
period
he
may
discover
embodied
within
its
texture
a
theme
or
idea
that
has
been
presented
elsewhere
and
at
other
times
in
various
ways
understanding
will
very
probably
require
both
these
commentaries
likely
it
will
also
include
a
recognition
that
the
work
we
are
reading
reflects
or
belongs
to
some
way
of
thought
labelled
as
a
school
or
an
a
complex
or
syndrome
of
ideas
occurring
together
with
sufficient
prominence
to
warrant
identification
ideas
like
grace
salvation
and
providence
cluster
together
in
traditional
the
work
studied
offers
us
a
special
or
even
an
individualized
rendering
or
treatment
of
the
ideas
in
question
so
that
the
student
finds
it
necessary
to
distinguish
carefully
between
the
several
expressions
of
an
or
mode
of
thought
we
may
speak
of
the
peculiar
to
poems
or
the
type
of
present
in
and
we
may
find
that
describing
such
or
such
and
contrasting
each
with
other
expressions
of
the
same
attitude
or
mode
of
thought
is
a
difficult
and
challenging
enterprise
all
is
no
orthodox
or
and
even
his
romantic
can
be
distinguished
from
that
of
his
contemporaries
attitude
of
defiance
which
colors
his
ideal
of
is
far
from
characteristic
of
a
thinker
like
whose
gentle
acquiescence
is
almost
comparable
to
the
patience
expressed
in
sonnet
on
his
own
blindness
recent
years
we
have
come
increasingly
to
recognize
that
ideas
have
a
history
and
that
not
the
least
important
chapters
of
this
history
have
to
do
with
thematic
or
conceptual
aspects
of
literature
and
the
arts
although
these
aspects
should
be
studied
in
conjunction
with
the
history
of
philosophy
of
religion
and
of
the
sciences
these
fields
are
surveyed
together
important
patterns
of
relationship
emerge
indicating
a
vast
community
of
reciprocal
influence
a
continuity
of
thought
and
expression
including
many
traditions
primarily
literary
religious
and
philosophical
but
frequently
including
contact
with
the
fine
arts
and
even
to
some
extent
with
science
we
may
observe
that
at
least
one
modern
philosophy
of
history
is
built
on
the
assumption
that
ideas
are
the
primary
objectives
of
the
research
us
quote
once
more
from
is
properly
concerned
with
the
actions
of
human
beings
from
the
outside
an
action
is
an
event
or
series
of
events
occurring
in
the
physical
world
regarded
from
the
inside
it
is
the
carrying
into
action
of
a
certain
thought
business
is
to
penetrate
to
the
inside
of
the
actions
with
which
he
is
dealing
and
reconstruct
or
rather
rethink
the
thoughts
which
constituted
them
is
a
characteristic
of
thoughts
that
in
them
we
come
ipso
facto
to
understand
why
they
were
thought
an
understanding
although
it
must
seek
to
be
sympathetic
is
not
a
matter
of
intuition
has
this
in
common
with
every
other
science
that
the
historian
is
not
allowed
to
claim
any
single
piece
of
knowledge
except
where
he
can
justify
his
claim
by
exhibiting
to
himself
in
the
first
place
and
secondly
to
any
one
else
who
is
both
able
and
willing
to
follow
his
demonstration
the
grounds
upon
which
it
is
based
is
what
was
meant
above
by
describing
history
as
inferential
knowledge
in
virtue
of
which
a
man
is
an
historian
is
a
knowledge
of
what
the
evidence
at
his
disposal
proves
about
certain
events
is
obvious
that
the
historian
who
seeks
to
recapture
the
ideas
that
have
motivated
human
behavior
throughout
a
given
period
will
find
the
art
and
literature
of
that
age
one
of
his
central
and
major
concerns
by
no
means
a
mere
supplement
or
adjunct
of
significant
historical
research
student
of
ideas
and
their
place
in
history
will
always
be
concerned
with
the
patterns
of
transition
which
are
at
the
same
time
patterns
of
transformation
whereby
ideas
pass
from
one
area
of
activity
to
another
us
survey
for
a
moment
the
development
of
modern
thought
turning
our
attention
from
the
toward
the
revolutionary
and
romantic
movements
that
follow
and
dwelling
finally
on
more
recent
decades
may
thus
trace
the
notion
of
individual
autonomy
from
its
manifestation
in
religious
practice
and
theological
reflection
through
practical
politics
and
political
theory
into
literature
and
the
arts
we
may
note
that
the
idea
appears
in
educational
theory
where
its
influence
is
at
present
widespread
one
will
deny
that
such
broad
developments
and
transitions
are
of
great
intrinsic
interest
and
the
study
of
ideas
in
literature
would
be
woefully
incomplete
without
frequent
reference
to
them
we
must
remember
that
we
cannot
construct
and
justify
generalizations
of
this
sort
unless
we
are
ready
to
consider
many
special
instances
of
influence
moving
between
such
areas
as
theology
philosophy
political
thought
and
literature
actual
moments
of
contact
are
vitally
important
moments
are
historical
events
in
the
lives
of
individual
authors
with
which
the
student
of
comparative
literature
must
be
frequently
concerned
the
most
powerful
and
most
frequently
recurring
literary
influence
on
the
world
has
been
that
of
the
and
one
of
the
most
important
comments
that
can
be
made
upon
the
spiritual
and
cultural
life
of
any
period
of
civilization
during
the
past
sixteen
or
seventeen
centuries

to
do
with
the
way
in
which
its

and
interpreted

the
comments
that
it
evoked

the
influence

us
say

all

tell
us
a
great
deal
about
these
three
men
and
the
age
that
each
represented
and
helped
bring
to
conscious
expression
much
the

way
we
recognize
the
importance
of
familarity

and
of
study
of
dialogues
and
of
enthusiastic
plundering
of
the
writings
of
many
philosophers

theologians

through
which
so
many
abstract
ideas
were
brought
to
the
attention
of

also
recognize
cases
in
which
the

influenced

example

a
broad
channel

find

grotesque
anticipation

natural
elimination
of

in
turn

to
have
borrowed
the
concept
from

an
important
caveat
is
in
order
must
avoid
the
notion
suggested
to
some
people
by
examples
such
as
those
just

that

three
volumes
brought
to
the
fore
a
characteristic
of
prose
which
remained
conspicuous
through
his
later
works
a
genius
for
describing
military
action
with
clarity
and
with
authority
confused
rambling
of
guerrilla
warfare
such
as
most
of
campaigns
were

brought

of
the

familiarity
alone
would
not

enough
without
other
qualities
knowledge
love
of
detail
and
a
sure
feeling
for
the
portrayal
of
action
were
the
added
ingredients
the
volumes
were
more
than
a
romantic
story
contributed
considerable
new
knowledge
of
the
issues
connected
with
his
subject
outstanding

was
in
where
he
made
use
of
unpublished
papers

materials
to
reveal
the
motives
which
led
the
government
to
permit
to
cross
the
of
looking
back
over
the
volumes
it
is
possible
to
find
errors
of
interpretation
some
of
which
were
not
so
evident
at
the
time
of
writing
repeats
the
story
which
pictured

refusing

this
part
of
the
legend
of
the
to

false

little
analysis
he
is
unduly
critical
of
papal
and

and
he
is
more
than
generous
in
assessing
policy
fifty
years
later
the
trilogy
still
maintains
a
firm
place
in
the
list
of
standard
works
on
the
unification
of
a
position
cautiously
prophesied
by
the
reviewers
at
the
time
of
publication
his
last
major
volume
on
an
theme
was
written
in
a
minor
key
in
it
did
not
gain
the
popular
acclaim
of
the
volumes
probably
because
felt
less
at
home
with
the
bourgeois
lawyer
than
with
the
filibuster
complexities
of
politics
eluded
him
but
the
story
of
the
revolution
itself
is
told
in
restrained
measures
with
no
superfluous
passages
and
only
an
occasional
overemphasis
of
the
part
played
by
its
leading
figure
it
is
not
one
of
his
best
books
it
can
only
be
considered
unsatisfactory
when
compared
with
his
own
had
begun
to
parallel
his
studies
with
several
works
on
figures
of
the
same
period
appeared
and
seven
years
later
the
two
is
incomparably
the
better
biography
centers
too
exclusively
on

insufficiently
appreciative
of
the
views
of
opponents
and
critics
and
makes
light
of
the
genuine
difficulties
faced
by
he
is
right
when
he
claims
in
his
autobiography
that
he
drew
the
real
features
of
the
man
his
tender
and
selfless
motives
and
his
rugged
fearless
strength
the
story
of
and
the
agitation
the
the
and
the
franchise
struggle
reflects
something
of
the
moral
power
which
enabled
this
independent
man
to
exercise
so
immense
an
influence
over
his
fellow
countrymen
for
so
long
speeches
were
so
much
a
part
of
him
there
are
long
and
numerous
quotations
which
far
from
making
the
biography
diffuse

to
give
us
the
feel
of
the
man

a
sense

the
through
his
family

in
this
biography
something
of
its
moral
conviction
and

seem
somehow
to
have
gone
out
of
fashion
and
the
book
has
never

strictly
speaking

the
figure

a
piece
of
passionate
special
pleading

with
the
heat
and
often
with
the
wisdom
it
must
be
said

damning

background

close
to
own
his
concentration
on
personalities
and
his
categorical
assessment
of
their
actions

to
convey
the
political
complexities
of
a
long
generation
harassed
by
war
and
confronted
with
the
problem
of
adjustment
to
an
unprecedented
industrial
and
social
transformation
historians
have
found
his
point
of
view
not
to
their
taste
others
have
complained
that
he
makes
the
tradition
appear
contemptible
rather
than
intelligible
while
a
sympathetic
critic
has
remarked
that
the
intricate
interplay
of
social
dynamics
and
political
activity
of
which
at
times
politicians
are
the
ignorant
marionettes
is
not
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
his
talents
heritage
which
informs
all
of
interpretations
of

seems
clearly
to
have
distorted

oversimplified

the

masterful
what
one
reader
called
a
series
of
dissolving
views

merges
one
period
into
another
and
gives
a
sense
of
continuous
growth
after
the
narrative

to
lose

quality

as
a
matter
of
fact
no
permit

was
all
they
needed

champion
me
would
all
meet
at
ten
at
the
bridge
five
miles
from
and
march
triumphantly
across
into
was
only
one
hitch
the
small
town
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
was
still
under
jurisdiction
real
frontier
was
beyond
the
limits
fact
all
persons
were
permitted
to
cross
the
into
there
being
no
sentry
posted
on
the
west
side
of
the
river
evening
as
learned
later
the
students
enjoying
that
spontaneous
immodesty
in
action
known
only
to
university
students
surged
out
onto
the
streets
of
overturning
empty
streetcars
marking
up
store
fronts
and
shouting
imprudently
to
power
got
off
the
trolley
at
bridge
the
next
morning
was
met
by
what
looked
like
students
some
of
whom
were
carrying
sticks
apparently
for
the
coming
battle
with
the
police
by
this
display
of
weapons
looked
toward
the
bridge
and
there
saw
stretched
across
the
near
side
a
cordon
of
policemen
their
bicycles
forming
a
roadblock
before
which
stood
several
officers
in
uniform
and
a
small
waspish
man
in
a
brown
derby
please
called
to
the
students
in
thank
you
most
heartily

being
here

full
evidence
of
your
support

my
principles

not
be
served
by
violence

any
form

are
right
they
will
prevail
of
and
by
themselves

you
all
to
support
me
in
this
one
finger
is
raised
against
the
authorities

this
respect

be
the
only
witness
to
your
understanding
of
what
am
saying

full
confidence
in
you
go
marched
up
to
the
waiting
officials
the
students
massed
behind
me
usual
the
press
photographers
were
on
hand
waspish
man
stopped
me
three
paces
from
the
bicycle
barricade
and
asked
me
in
if
had
papers
to
leave
replied
in
the
affirmative
taking
out
my
recently
acquired
titre
et
de
voyage
on
which
was
stamped
a
permission
to
leave
examined
it
carefully
handed
it
back
and
said
bien
you
may
leave
took
one
step
eastward
of
the
uniformed
officers
stepped
in
my
way
demanding
to
know
whether
had
permission
to
enter
have
no
permission
to
enter
told
him
you
may
go
no
farther
he
said
imperiously
this
then
the
frontier
asked
him
this
the
students
let
out
a
yell
knowing
full
well
the
actual
frontier
was
beyond
the
town
of
have
no
permission
to
and
have
just
left
told
him
must
then
be
standing
on
the
line
between
and
waspish

forward

is
no
line
between
and
that

if
there
is
no
line

did
have
witnesses
as
you
know

no
permission

enter
stuck
on
the
line
between
the
two
countries
students
were
laughing
uproariously
at
this
piece
of
logic
and
even
the
policemen
were
trying
hard
not
to
smile
non
the
man
coaxed

on
the
other
side
of
him
man
looked
uneasily
at
his
compatriot
the
crowd
were
coming
cries
of
right

be
a
line
continue
their
hesitation
said
until
have
permission
to
enter
or
a
visa
to
shall
be
obliged
to
remain
here
on
the
line
between
two
countries
whereupon
moved
to
the
side
of
the
road
parked
my
backpack
against
the
small
guardhouse
on
the
sidewalk
sat
down
took
out
my
typewriter
and
began
typing
the
above
conversation
reporters
were
questioning
the
man
and
the
officer
both
of
whom
remained
noncommittal
as
to
what
action
if
any
would
be
taken
in
my
regard
they
went
off
to
file
their
stories
after
the
photographers
had
taken
pictures
of
my
latest
vigil
students
crowded
around
asking
questions
slapping
me
on
the
back
and
generally
being
friendly
what
will
you
do
this
evening
a
young
mustached
will
be
very
cold

told
him
except
that

tent

said
have
a
small
sports
shop
in
would
be
a
great
help
told
him
thanking
him
for
his
thoughtfulness
special
guard
was
posted
at
my
end
of
the
bridge
to
make
sure
cross
the
ludicrousness
of
the
situation
being
revealed
fully
in
that
everyone
else
men
women
and
children
dogs
cats
horses
cars
trucks
baby
carriages
could
cross
bridge
into
without
surveillance
day
passed
eventfully
enough
with
a
constant
stream
of
visitors
some
stopping
only
to
say
hello
others
getting
into
serious
conversations
such
as
one
a
journalist
from
who
wrote
an
article
for
the
in
highly
sympathetic
terms
students
from
the
returned
around
six
with
a
large
pot
containing
enough
hot
soup
to
last
me
a
week
volunteer
food
brigade
had
been
arranged
they
told
me
which
would
supply
me
with
the
necessities
as
long
as
remained
at
the
bridge
little
later
the
sports
shop
man
returned
with
a
small
pup
tent
of
the
girl
students
sitting
by
while
ate
the
thick
soup
asked
me
if
had
a
sleeping
bag
informed
her
that
she
said
she
would
borrow
her
and
bring
it
to
me
later
that
evening
do
not
know
me
she
said
in
good
but
my
mother
was
your
governess
in
when
you
were
a
child

was
was
delighted
to
make
that
personal
contact
in
such
trying
and
unusual
circumstances
family
proved
wonderful
and
helpful
friends
in
the
following
days
little
and
who
generously
lent
me
his
sleeping
bag
for
my
on
the
a
line
from
the
bridge
to
a
small
field
directly
to
the
side
pitched
the
tent
that
evening
on
the
stateless
line
digging
a
small
trench
around
it
as
best
could
with
a
toy
spade
donated
by
a
neighborhood
child
wind
from
the
was
damp
and
chill
necessitating
a
fire
for
warmth
scouring
around
a
bit
in
the
open
area
came
across
what
proved
to
be
logs
which
crackled
and
burned
brightly
giving
off
vast
rolls
of
smoke
into
the
ashen
sky
evening
the
students
appeared
with
the
soup
kettle
and
several
petits
pains
usually
being
among
them
had
advised
friends
to
write
me
to
and
enough
mail
began
trickling
in
delivered
by
a
talkative
highly
amused
postman
who
informed
me
there
had
been
quite
a
debate
at
the
post
office
as
to
whether
that
address
would
be
recognized
students
brought
out
two
small
trees
which
placed
on
either
side
of
the
tent
the
field
on
which
my
tent
was
pitched
was
a
favorite
natural
playground
for
the
kids
of
the
neighborhood
had
made
many
friends
among
them
taking
part
in
their
games
and
trying
desperately
to
translate
into
an
understandable
as
we
gathered
around
the
fire
in
front
of
the
tent
my
great
surprise
and
delight
when
they
saw
the
two
trees
they
went
rushing
off
returning
shortly
with
decorations
from
their
own
trees
was
a
merry
if
somewhat
soggy
for
me
that
year
the
mail
were
invitations
to
speak
at
the
universities
of
and
thousand
world
citizens
at
had
signed
a
petition
inviting
me
to
visit
their
town
was
approached
by
a
world
citizen
delegation
to
find
out
his
disposition
of
my
case
he
gave
them
his
personal
approval
of
my
entry
saying
that
all
men
advocating
peace
should
be
welcomed
into
special
guard
however
was
still
posted
on
bridge
it
began
raining
at
around
eight
on
retired
into
my
tent
early
somewhat
tired
and
discouraged
my
body
reacting
sluggishly
because
of
the
continued
exposure
matter
how
large
the
fire
seem
to
shake
off
the
chill
that
day
are
you
there
voice
drifted
in
to
me
above
the
patter
of
the
rain
shortly
after
had
fallen
into
a
fitful
sleep
is
it
from
the
of
delegation
we
have
a
word
with
you
sorry
had
a
trying
day
and
just
make
it
out
again
told
them
heard
nothing
more
learned
that
had
expressed
a
desire
to
see
me
hence
their
trip
to
the
evening
of
noticed
my
pallid
look
and
rasping
voice
entreated
me
to
see
a
doctor
and
when
refused
brought
one
out
to
see
me
advised
immediate
hospitalization
hear
of
it
because
it
meant
giving
up
the
line
though
realized
was
in
poor
shape
physically
mistaking
my
hesitation
assured
me
that
the
hospital
expense
would
be
taken
care
of
by
a
leading
merchant
in
whom
she
had
already
approached
not
that
told
her
see
once
relinquish
the
position
already
established
here
regain
it
without
sacrificing
the
logic
of
it
that
moment
up
walked
a
tall
young
man
with
glasses
who
announced
himself
as
a
world
citizen
from
preliminaries
asked
him
you
are
a
world
citizen
will
you
take
place
in
his
tent
while
he
goes
to
the
hospital
of
course
with
pleasure
he
replied
looked
at
me
looked
from
her
to
him
is
your
name
asked
him
said
have
just
enlisted
for
the
jumped
up
ran
to
him
and
gave
him
a
little
hug
am
so
happy
come
we
must
go
quickly
is
a
police
car
outside
they
will
take
us
were
the
incongruities
of
the
situation
that
the
very
police
assigned
to
check
up
on
me
were
drafted
into
driving
me
to
the
while
waved
adieu
from
the
remembered
every
detail
of
his
movements
but
nothing
of
the
final
desperate
rush
to
come
to
grips
with
the
enemy
the
victory
cheer
went
up
this
officer
found
himself
still
mounted
with
his
horse
pressed
broadside
against
log
parapet
in
a
tangled
group
of
infantrymen
hat
was
gone
the
tears
were
streaming
from
his
eyes
never
knew
how
he
got

climactic
minutes
in
an
life
left
no
memory
hundred

surrendered
within
their
works
and
a
thousand
more
were
captured

that
night
and
the
next
day
field
guns
were
captured

battle
flags
and
fourteen
swords
were
sent
to
headquarters
was
the
only
sizable
assault
upon

behind

successfully
made
by
either
side
during
the
campaign
of
lost
of
its
numbers
within
a
few
minutes
among
them
being
several

of
service
had
expired
but
who
had
volunteered
to
advance
with
their
regiment
of
one
of
the
regiments
in
during
command
suffered
its
greatest
loss
of
the
war
in
this
action
popular
belief
grew
up
after
the
war
that
the
only
time
during
the
that
ever
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
was
when
he
went
to
hurry
up
for
this
assault
was
responsible
for
the
story
when
he
said
in
his
memoirs
that
this
was
the
only
time
he
could
recall
seeing

so
fast

him
to
restrain
his
mount
from
its
most
violent
gait
he
moved
quickly
enough
when
he
had
to
is
not
in
the
record
but
he
must
have
galloped
his
horse
at
when
he
brought
up
guns
to
save
crumbling
line
the
final
combat
of
the
campaign
was
being
worked
out
at
on
instructions
ordered
now
commanding
the
to
make
an
effort
to
occupy
if
he
could
do
so
without
exposing
his
bridgehead
to
a
counterattack
dispatch
must
have
been
sent
after
sundown
on
made
his
reconnaissanace
the
next
morning
found
the
town
empty
accepted
the
surrender
of
the
mayor
and
occupied
the
city
a
little
before

the
morning
of
the
and
the
of

the
followed

noon
they
came
up
with
the
enemy
two
miles
from
and
deployed
assaulted
and
carried
a
small
portion
of
the
enemy
works
but
could
not
hold
possession
of
the
gain
for
want
of
cooperation
from
the
balance
of
the
line
night
a
note
written
in
hand
and
dated
from
inside
the
captured
city
came
to
stating
that
the
was
in
possession
of
making
the
news
public
sent
an
officer
with
the
note
to
a
short
time
the
officer
returned
and
followed
on
his
heels
cautious
the
note
and
then
making
up
his
mind
that
it
was
genuine
snapped
his
fingers
whistled
and
almost
danced
in
his
exuberance
next
day
issued
his
orders
ending
the
campaign
and
pulled
his
armies
back
to
measure
of
combat
efficiency
in
an
indecisive
campaign
is
a
matter
of
personal
choice
laid
great
store
by
place
captures
refused
to
notice
anything
except
captured
guns
and
colors
both
standards
had
the
right
to
be
proud
thanked
his
men
for
their
tenacity
of
purpose
unmurmuring
endurance
cheerful
obedience
brilliant
heroism
and
high
qualities
in
battle
felt
that
his
own
part
in
the
campaign
was
skillful
and
well
executed
but
that
the
slowness
of
a
part
of
his
army
robbed
him
of
the
larger
fruits
of
victory
supposed
the
military
world
would
approve
of
his
accomplishment
the
military
world
thought
the
political
world
approved
it
wholeheartedly
some
time
despondency
in
some
quarters
had
been
displayed
in
two
ways
an
eagerness
for
peace
and
a
dissatisfaction
with
were
in
the
air
for
a

was
sure
that

not

the
talk
of

and
boosted
into

the
no

could
have
been
more
complete
congratulations
showered
upon
and
his
army
mentioned
their
distinguished
ability
courage
and
perseverance
felt
that
this
campaign
would
be
famous
in
the
annals
of
war
called
it
prompt
skillful
and
brilliant
described
it
as
the
most
brilliant
of
the
war
the
campaign
was
a
military
failure
best
to
destroying
an
army
is
to
deprive
it
of
its
freedom
of
action
had
accomplished
this
much
of
his
job
and
then
inexplicably
nullified
it
by
his
retreat
from
to
so
far
as
its
territorial
objectives
were
concerned
the
campaign
was
successful
the
narrow
frame
of
military
tactics
too
the
experts
agree
that
the
campaign
was
brilliant
seventeen
weeks
the
military
front
was
driven
southward
more
than
miles
was
a
battle
on
an
average
of
once
every
three
weeks
skirmishing
was
almost
constant
the
summary
of
the
principal
events
of
the
campaign
compiled
from
the
official
records
there
are
only
ten
days
which
show
no
fighting
casualties
in
the
of
the
were
while
for
all
three
armies
they
were
were
killed
in
their
camps
at
their
meals
and
in
their
sleep
fire
often
kept
the
opposing
gunners
from
manning
their
pieces
warfare
was
born
in
this
campaign
periscopes
camouflage
booby
traps
land
mines
extended
order
trench
raids
foxholes
armored
cars
night
attacks
flares
sharpshooters
in
trees
interlaced
vines
and
treetops
which
were
the
forerunners
of
barbed
wire
trip
wires
to
thwart
a
cavalry
charge
which
presaged
the
mine
trap
and
the
general
use
of
anesthetics
use
of
map
coordinates
was
begun
when
the
senior
officers
began
to
select
tactical
points
by
designating
a
spot
as
near
the
letter
o
in
the
word
mountain
few
weeks
later
the
maps
were
being
divided
into
squares
and
a
position
was
described
as
being
about
lots
and
with
pickets
forward
as
far
as
system
was
dependent
upon
identical
maps
and
supplied

to
specify
the
standard

for
the
movement
proved
that
a
railway
base
could
be
movable
and
the
most
brilliant
feature
of
the
campaign
was
the
rapid
repair
of
the
tracks
the
it
seemed
as
if
carried
tunnels
and
bridges
in
his
pockets
whistle
of
locomotives
often
drowned
out
the
rattle
of
the
skirmish
fire
always
the
ranks
worked
out
new
and
better
tactics
but
there
was
brilliance
in
the
way
the
field
commands
adopted
these
methods
and
in
the
way
the
army
commanders
incorporated
them
into
their
military
thinking
fossilized
formalized
thinking
of
the
legendary
military
brain
was
not
evident
in
armies
could
never
be
accused
of
sticking
too
long
with
the
old
of
most
serious
shortcomings
however
was
his
mistrust
of
his
cavalry
never
saw
that
it
was
a
complement
to
his
infantry
and
not
a
substitute
for
it
in
some
way
this
lack
of
faith
in
the
cavalry
became
mixed
up
in
his
mind
with
the
dragging
effect
of
wagon
trains
and
was
hardened
into
a
prejudice
horse

twenty
pounds

his
cavalry

the
test
it

his
plans

forced
into
a
campaign
without
optimum
mobility
and
with
its
commander
stripped
from
it

the
uses
of

he
imagined
a

the

of

of
his
distress
at
having
had
to
leave

this
new

had

a
very
absurd
and
annoying
situation

was
placed
by
curious
methods
of
handling
me
never

me
know
that
my
visit
was
about
to
terminate
until
the
actual
morning
was
to
leave
for
result
was
that
found
myself
in
the
ridiculous
position
of
having
made
a
formal
engagement
by
letter
for
the
next
week
only
two
days
before
my
departure
from
both
women
knew
my
position
and
if
anyone
suffered
in
their
opinion
it
was
not
need
hardly
be
remarked
that
was
not
generally
known
for
his
scrupulosity
about
keeping
his
social
engagements

makes
his
irritation
in
this
letter
all
the
more
significant
and
her
daughter
began
a
correspondence
which
included
fervent
verses

a
proper
alarm
she
knew

upon
almost
as
a
saint
but
others
read
in
what
they
took
to
be
the
confessions
of
a
great

has

some
weeks

staying
at
a

her

that

to

she

not

any
more
than
did
the

that
her

might
marry

she
used
it
to
suggest
to
that
is
not
in
her
nature
to
love
you
his
part
had
explained
in
a
previous
letter
that
there
would
be
nothing
but
an
honorable
friendship
between
and
himself
no
time
does
he
seem
to
have
proposed
marriage
and
was
evidently
torn
between
a
concern
for
her
emotions
and
the
desire
to
believe
that
the
friendship
might
be
continued
without
harm
to
her
reputation
any
case
she
told
that
she
saw
no
reason
why
he
might
not
see
again
now
that
this
frank
explanation
has
been
made
no
one
can
misunderstand
ended
her
letter
with
the
assurance
that
she
considered
his
friendship
for
her
daughter
and
herself
to
be
an
honor
from
which
she
could
not
part
without
still
more
pain

to
to

he
received
a
letter
from
which
was
dated
regretted
what
she
described
as
the
unwarrantable
unnecessary
check
to
their
friendship
and
said
that
she
felt
that
they

an
invitation

a

if
you

you

sincerely
invitation
was
accepted
and
other
letters
followed
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
concern
for
his
health
and
her
delight
in
seeing
him
so
much
at
home
among
the
crippled
children
she
served
is
difficult
to
say
what
expected
would
come
of
their
relationship
which
had
begun
so
soon
after
his
emotions
had
been
stirred
by
but
when
wrote
on
to
tell
him
that
she
was
to
be
married

vicar
of
in
the
news
evidently
helped
to
deepen
his
discouragement
over
the
failure
of
his
hopes
for
a
new
volume
of
verse
a
letter
to
which
was
written
in
less
than
a
month
before
wedding
he
was
highly
melodramatic
in
his
despair
and
once
again
announced
his
intention
of
returning
to
the
life
of
the
streets
week
in
arrears
and
without
means
to
pay
must
go
it
is
the
only
right
thing
would
do
me
the
undeserved
kindness
to
keep
my
own
copy
of
the
first
edition
of
my
first
book
with
all
its
mementos
of
her
and
the
dear
ones
not
least
there
are
some
poems
which
sent
me
addressed
to
herself
when
was
preparing
a
fresh
volume
asking
me
to
include
them
terrible
blow
of
the
put
an
end
to
that
project
wish
you
would
return
them
to
her
have
not
the
heart
never
had
the
courage
to
look
at
them
when
my
projected
volume
became
hopeless
fearing
they
were
poor
until
now
when
was
obliged
to
do
so
my
genius
young
and
ripening
you
would
swear
when
wrote
them
and
now
has
it
all
come
to
chance
of
fulfilling
my
destiny
is
over
want
you
to
be
grandfather
to
these
orphaned
poems
dear
now
am
gone
and
launch
them
on
the
world
when
their
time
comes
them
a
box
will
be
lodgment
enough
cannot
mind
your
seeing
them
now
since
my
silence
must
have
ended
when
gave
the
purposed
volume
to
you
ask
you
to
do
me
the
last
favour
of
reading
them
by
evening
about
which
time
shall
come
to
say
my
sad
you
think
much
of
them
tell
me
the
wholesome
truth
otherwise
you
will
give
me
a
pleasure
is
strange
but
this
yes
terrible
step
am
about
to
take
is
lightened
with
an
inundating
joy
by
the
hope
that
here
in
these
poems
is
treasure
or
at
least
some
measure
of
beauty
which
did
not
know
of
of
course
was
persuaded
not
to
take
the
terrible
step
once
again
paid
his
debts
and
it
was
rather
than
whose

was
soon
ended

which

obscure
the
fact
that
undoubtedly
they
have
more
than
a
little
of

there
was
evidently
no

the

a
wish
to
identify
his
own

with
the
misfortunes
of
other
poets
who
had
known
unhappy
loves
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
his
genuine
emotion
for
she
was
affected
by
his
protestations
seems
obvious
but
since
she
was
evidently
a
sensible
young
woman
as
well
as
an
outgoing
and
sympathetic
type
it
would
seem
that
for
her
the
word
friendship
had
a
far
less
intense
emotional
significance
than
that
which
gave
it
the
outset
she
must
have
realized
that
marriage
with
him
was
out
of
the
question
and
although
she
was
displeased
by
the
unwarrantable
interference
it
seems
probable
that
she
did
agree
with
her
suggestion
that
the
poet
was
perhaps
a
man
most
fitted
to
live
die
solitary

love

which

no
great
technical
advance
over
those
of
the
group

are
if
anything
somewhat
more
labored
interest
remains
chiefly
biographical
for
they
throw
some
light
on
the
utter
despair
which
overtook
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
of
or
not
is
correct
in
suggesting
that
resumption
of
the
opium
habit
also
dates
from
this
period
is
of
course
a
matter
of
conjecture
simply
states
without
offering
any
supporting
evidence
that
after
he
returned
to
he
resumed
his
draughts
of
laudanum
and
continued
this
right
up
to
his
death
is
every
reason
to
recognize
that
in
the
very
last
years
of
his
life
as
we
shall
see
did
take
the
drug
in
carefully
rationed
doses
to
ease
the
pains
of
his
illness
but
the
exact
date
at
which
this
began
has
never
been
determined
as
says
nearly
all
his
poetry
was
produced
when
he
was
not
taking
opium
there
may
be
some
reason
to
doubt
that
he
was
under
its
influence
in
the
period
from
to
when
he
was
writing
the
poems
to
and
making
plans
for
another
book
of
verse
any
event
the
critical
productivity
of
that
time
is
abundant
proof
that
if
he
was
taking
laudanum
it
was
never
in
command
of
him
to
the
extent
that
it
had
been
during
his
vagrant
years
remedy
for
despondent
mood
was
typically
practical
simply
found
more
work
for
him
to
do
and
the
articles
and
reviews
continued
without
an
evident
break
a
reviewer
generally
displayed
a
judicious
attitude
he
read
some
of
the
books
assigned
to
him
with
a
studied
carefulness
is
evident
from
his
notes
which
are
often
so
full
that
they
provide
an
unquestionable
basis
for
the
identification
of
reviews
that
were
printed
without
his
signature
the
basis
of
this
careful
reading
frequently
gave
a
clear
complete
and
interesting
description
of
a
prose
work
or
chose
effective
quotations
to
illustrate
his
discussions
of
poetry
was
seldom
an
unmethodical
critic
and
his
reviews
generally
followed
a
systematic
pattern
a
description
of
what
the
work
contained
a
treatment
of
the
things
that
had
especially
interested
him
in
it
and
wherever
possible
a
balancing
of
whatever
artistic
merits
and
faults
he
might
have
found
was
of
course
in
this
drawing
of
the
balance
sheet
of
judgment
that
he
most
clearly
displayed
his
desire
to
do
full
justice
to
an
author
for
example
found
that
there
was
too
much
metrical
dialectic
he
said
must
be
dogmatic
it
must
not
stoop
to
argue
like
a
in
impressed
him
as
a
poet
capable
of
sustained
power
passion
or
beauty
and
he
cited
specific
passages
to
illustrate
not
only
these
qualities
but
command
of
imagery
as
well
he
wrote
that
had
a
too
deliberate
manner
as
well
as
a
lack
of
inevitable
felicity
in
diction
he
admired
subtle
intellectuality
and
delighted
in
the
inversion
by
which
becomes
the
most
fatal
allurement
in
course
there
were
books
about
which
nothing
good
could
be
said
as
he
did
the
difficulty
of
the
art
of
poetry
and
believing
that
the
only
technical
criticism
worth
having
in
poetry
is
that
of
poets
he
felt
obliged
to
insist
upon
his
duty
to
be
hard
to
please

it
came
to

agreed

for
a

quite
well
the
newcomer
in
turn

to
know
others
was
the
a
capable
conniver
whose
father
had
been
a
blacksmith
but
who
had
fawned
his
way
up
the
ladder
of
and
favor
till
he
was
now
a
brigadier
and
would
one
day
be
the
daggerman
designated
to
do
in

traveling
all
the
way
to
to
procure
just
the
right

were
several

such

a

at
the

were
quick

his
energy
monstrous
but
these
qualities
were
sapped
by
an
lethargy

a
policy
of
letting
nothing

at

was
apt
to
stride
through

like
a
cock
to
wake
his
men
breakfast
was
tea
his
dinner
fell
anywhere
from
nine
to
noon
his
supper
was
nothing
worn
a
watch
or
carried
pocket
money
for
years
because
he
disliked
both
but

among
his
hates
were
looking

snatched
one
from
an
grasp

smashed
it
to
smithereens

several
pet
birds
and

cats
well
enough
that
if
one
crept
by
he
would
mew
at
it

were
greeted
with
a
cordial
bark
who
had
never

his
adored
declare

as

featuring

probably
at
this
period
that
got
his
first
good
look
at
the
ordinary
soldier
illiterate
boors
conscripted
from
villages
all
across
the
empire
had
may
have
told
just
two
things
a
commander
could
count
on
physical
fitness
and
personal
courage
their
levies
came
shambling
into
camp
they
were
all
elbows

and
beard
emerged
as
interchangeable
cogs
in
a
faulty
but
formidable
machine
shaved
nearly
naked

queued
greatcoated
jackbooted
and
best
of
all
in
the
opinion
of
the
professional
their
minds
are
not
estranged
from
the
paths
of
obedience
by
those
smatterings
of
knowledge
which
only
serve
to
lead
to
insubordination
and
mutiny
pleading
her
cause
must
have
said
that
was
the
most
distinguished
physician
in
the
of
for
our
man
poured
out
his
symptoms
and
drew
a
madly
waving
line
indicating
the
irregularity
of
his
pulse
got
high
blood
pressure
too
and
bum
kidneys
the
doctor
said
to
me
look
waxy
skin
could
well
be
uremia
looked
disapprovingly
at
an
ash
tray
piled
high
with
cigarette
stubs
shook
his
head
and
moved
his
hand
back
and
forth
in
a
strong
negative
gesture
little
official
hung
his
head
in
shame
this
his
colleague
at
the
next
desk
gave
a
short
contemptuous
laugh
pushed
forward
his
own
ash
tray
innocent
of
a
single
butt
thumped
his
chest
to
show
his
excellent
condition
and
looked
proud
doctor
gravely
nodded
approval
this
moment
came
hurrying
up
to
announce
that
the
problem
was
solved
and
all
had
to
do
was
to
sign
a
sheaf
of
papers
went
out
of
the
office
and
down
the
hall
to
a
window
where
documents
and
more
officials
awaited
us
the
rest
of
the
office
personnel
hot
upon
our
heels
this
time
word
had
got
around
that
an
doctor
was
on
the
premises
fellow
who
had
liver
spots
held
out
his
hands
to
the
great
healer
was
funny
but
it
was
also
touching
know
said
to
me
later
am
thinking
of
setting
up
the
might
not
make
any
money
but
sure
have
patients
luncheon
we
took
advantage
of
the
siesta
period
to
try
to
get
in
touch
with
a
few
people
to
whom
our
dear
friend
had
written
is
a
member
of
the
staff
who
although
born
in
was
born
there
of
parents
years
of
her
life
have
been
spent
in
the
homeland
and
she
had
written
to
friends
to
alert
them
of
our
coming
you
have
to
do
dear
is
to
phone
on
your
arrival
are
longing
to
see
you
wear
and
tear
of
life
have
taught
me
that
very
few
friends
of
mutual
friends
long
to
see
foreign
strangers
but
planned
on
being
the
soul
of
tact
of
giving
them
plenty
of
outs
was
there
the
tiniest
implication
that
their
cups
were
already
running
over
without
us
diplomacy
was
needless
phone
service
is
worse
than
so
that
it
was
to
be
some
little
time
before
contact
of
any
sort
was
established
the
late
afternoon
came
back
to
fetch
us
and
we
drove
to
the
stopped
first
at
the
amphitheater
that
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
height
crowned
by
the
curving
benches
are
broken
chipped
tumbled
but
still
in
place
as
are
the
marble
chairs
the
seats
of
honor
for
the
legislators
carved
statues
of
the
frieze
against
the
low
wall
are
for
the
most
part
headless
but
their
exquisitely
graceful
nude
and
draped
torsos
and
the
kneeling
are
well
preserved
in
their
perfect
proportion
completed
our
camera
work
we
started
our
climb
suppose
the
same
emotion
holds
if
to
a
lesser
degree
with
any
famous
monument
it
live
up
to
its
reputation
weight
of
fame
and
history
is
formidable
and
dreary
steel
engravings
in
schoolbooks
do
little
to
quicken
interest
and
imagination
huh
we
think
looking
at
them
so
the
then
perhaps
one
day
we
get
to
are
here
come
a
long
way
and
spent
a
lot
of
money
had
better
be
good
worry
about
the
is
every
visitor
has
a
favorite
time
for
his
first
sight
of
it
saw
it
frequently
afterward
but
our
suggestion
for
the
very
first
encounter
is
near
sunset
light
at
that
time
is
a
benediction
serene
majestic
columns
of
the
tawny
in
color
against
the
pure
deep
blue
sky
frame
incredible
vistas
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
stand
very
quietly
and
look
and
look
and
look
than
hundred
years
old
bruised
battered
worn
and
partially
destroyed
combining
to
an
astounding
degree
solidity
and
grace
it
still
stands
incomparable
testimony
to
aspiration
the
who
had
been
in
control
of
the
city
since
the
fifteenth
century
with
a
truly
shattering
lack
of
prudence
used
the
as
a
powder
magazine
was
hit
by
a
shell
fired
by
the
bombarding
army
and
the
great
central
portion
of
the
temple
was
blown
to
smithereens
is
the
temple
of
architectural
feature
the
caryatides
upholding
the
portico
famous
around
the
world
as
the
of
the
was
referred
to
airily
by
as
the
beautiful
building
is
the
the
entrance
gate
of
the
other
nugget
of
art
and
architectural
knowledge
besides
remembering
that
it
was
who
designed
the
doors
of
the
baptistery
in
is
the
three
styles
of
columns
some
happy
reason
and
have
always
stuck
in
my
mind
can
identify
each
design
remained
however
for
to
teach
me
that
symbolized
strength
wisdom
and
beauty
the
three
pillars
of
the
ancient
world
columns
of
the
are
fluted
classic
sight
that
gave
us
considerable
pleasure
was
the
sentry
in
his
ballet
skirt
with
great
pompons
on
his
shoes
who
was
patrolling
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
palace
on
shoulder
he
would
march
smartly
for
a
few
yards
bring
his
heels
together
with
a
click
make
a
brisk
pirouette
skirts
flaring
and
march
back
to
his
point
of
departure
did
not
dare
speak
to
so
exalted
a
being
but
aimed
his
camera
and
shot
him
so
to
speak
on
the
rise
the
split
second
between
the
halt
and
the
turn
evening
of
our
first
day
we
drove
with
and
who
were
friends
and
patients
of
to
dine
at
a
restaurant
on
the
shores
of
the
the
way
out
detoured
up
a
special
hill
from
which
one
may
obtain
a
matchless
view
of
the
lighted
by
night
great
spectacle
was
a
source
of
rancor
and
et
which
the
were
trying
to
promote
with
the
was
the
reason
performances
were
being
staged
at
historical
monuments
throughout
a
combination
of
music
lighting
effects
and
narration
famous
events
that
have
transpired
in
these
locations
are
evoked
and
for
large
audiences
usually
to
considerable
acclaim
had
been
scheduled
for
the
treatment
too
but
apparently
it
was
to
take
place
at
the
time
of
the
full
moon
when
the
themselves
out
of
respect
for
the
natural
beauty
of
the
occasion
were
wont
to
forgo
their
own
usual
nocturnal
illumination
society
was
split
into
two
factions
the
and
the
contended
that
the
gross
of
soul
were
all
for
having
et
since
the
were
footing
the
bill
and
the
attraction
wherever
it
had
been
done
had
proven
popular
was
the
crassest
kind
of
materialism
and
they
the
would
have
no
truck
with
it
was
unique
in
the
world
and
if
that
imcomparable
work
flooded
by
moonlight
enough
for
both
natives
and
tourists
then
they
were
quite
simply
barbarians
and
the
hell
with
them
was
very
stimulating
restaurant
to
which
the
took
us
on
this
night
of
controversy
was
the
on
beach
is
a
public
bathing
beach
easily
accessible
by
tramway
from
the
center
of
workers
frequently
go
out
there
to
lunch
and
swim
during
the
siesta
period
which
during
the
summer
lasts
from
two
until
five
in
the
afternoon
when
shops
and
offices
are
again
open
for
business
close
sometime
after
eight
is
the
rush
hour
when
the
busses
are
jammed
and
by
the
restaurants
are
beginning
to
fill
is
late
for
the
balmy
evenings
are
delightful
and
everyone
wants
to
linger
under
the
stars
sand
is
fine
and
pleasant
the
cabanas
are
clean
and
the
parasols
green
raspberry
and
butter
yellow
are
very
gay
open
to
the
general
public
it
is
not
overcrowded
the
atmosphere
is
that
of
an
attractive
private
beach
club
at
home
went
there
a
couple
of
times
to
swim
and
enjoyed
ourselves
thoroughly
agreeable
state
of
affairs
is
explicable
think
on
two
counts
is
is
not
yet
suffering

obviously
frightened

expecting

too
hungry
not

snatch
the

was
one
of
the
highlights
of
our
trip
but
beginning
in
and
continuing
around
the
world
throughout
the
treatment
of
animals
was
horrifying
ranging
from
callous
indifference
to
active
cruelty
of
course
was
not
true
of
the
educated
and
sophisticated
people
we
met
who
loved
their
pets
but
kindness
is
not
a
basic
human
instinct
met
some
charming
and
among
them
our
chauffeur
ranked
high
was
limited
and
the
little
he
knew
he
found
irritating
particularly
galling
phrase
was
we
have

he
claimed
was
the
favorite
refrain
of
the
would
be
lolling
under
a
tree
sipping
relishing
the
leisurely
life
assuring
him
that
the

was
yet
young

honest
and
they
discard
him
let
him
be
ready
to
invent
whatever
falsehood
to
assail
whatever
character
and
to
prostitute
his
paper
to
whatever
ends
and
they
hug
him
to
their
heart
proportion
to
the
degradation
of
his
moral
worth
is
the
increase
of
his
worth
to
them
exonerate
the

and
thereby
extricate
himself
from
a
sticky
situation
took
another
course
and
made
it
appear
that
the
legislature
had
been
bilked
claimed
in
his
attacks
that
with
scurrilous
underhandedness
had
deliberately
written
an
ambiguous
bid
that
had
so
confused
the
honest
members
of
the
legislature
that
they
had
awarded
him
the
contract
without
knowing
what
they
were
doing
charge
was
so
farfetched
that
paid
little
attention
to
it
and
answered
in
a
rather
bored
way
wearily
declaring
that
a
new
hand
was
pumping
the
bellows
of
the
organ
and
concluding
a
controversy
with
an
adversary
so
utterly
destitute
of
moral
principles
even
a
triumph
would
entitle
the
victor
to
no
laurels
game
is
not
worth
the
ammunition
it
would
cost
therefore
leave
the
writer
to
the
enjoyment
of
the
unenvied
reputation
which
the
personal
abuse
he
has
heaped
on
us
will
entitle
him
to
from
the
low
and
vulgar
herd
to
which
he
belongs
continuing
refusal
to
debate
with
through
the
columns
of
his
newspaper
did
not
let
up
his
attack
for
a
moment
the
months
he
became
a
political
gadfly
with
an
incessant
barrage
of
satirical
poems
ridiculing
the
letters
belittling
and
long
analytical
articles
vilifying
persistent
were
these
attacks
that
in
of
the
following
year
was
finally
moved
to
action
and
was
to
learn
his
first
lesson
in
frontier
politics
the
subtle
art
of
diversion
attack
directly
would
gain
little
for
as
a
penniless
newcomer
had
nothing
to
lose
this
time
had
accurately
measured
as
a
man
of
great
personal
pride
a
man
who
would
fly
into
a
towering
rage
if
his
integrity
were
questioned
and
who
would
be
anxious
to
avenge
himself
honor
would
now
come
under
attack
but
not
by
himself
charges
would
be
made
in
by
an
anonymous
correspondent
and
would
be
so
busy
trying
to
track
down
the
illusive
character
assassin
that
he
would
forget
about
harassing
strategy
worked
perfectly
was
stunned
by
the
first
blast
against
his
character
which
was
published
in
the
issue
of
under
the
name
anonymous
correspondent
did
not
resort
to
innuendoes
called
a
thief
said

stolen
mules
from
during
the
expedition
he
accused
of
continuing
his
career
in
with
the
theft
of
some
otter
skins
in
charges
caught
off
balance
coming
as
they
did
from
an
unexpected
quarter
he
used
the
of
for
a
denial
sending
immediately
to
and
for
documents
to
vindicate
himself
and
demanding
that
reveal
the
name
of
this
perfidious
slanderer
who
disguised
himself
under
a
pastoral
pseudonym
said
nothing
and
frustrated
stormed
throughout
in
an
unsuccessful
search
for
asking
his
friends
to
keep
their
ears
open
he
learned
through
the
grapevine
that
the
culprit
might
be
one
in
further
inquiry
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
was
guilty
and
following
the
honorable
route
that
would
eventually
lead
to
the
dueling
ground
sent
a
message
to
through
his
friends
demanding
that
he
either
confirm
or
deny
his
complicity
did
neither
silence
was
tantamount
to
an
admission
of
guilt
and
he
determined
to
get
onto
the
dueling
ground
at
all
costs
he
wrote
an
open
letter
in
making
it
known
to
the
world
that
is
by
his
own
admission
a
base
liar
and
a
slanderer
was
a
liar
and
a
slanderer
he
was
also
a
very
canny
gentleman
for
nothing
that
could
do
would
pry
so
much
as
a
single
word
out
of
him
with
his
own
defense
and
his
attempts
to
get
to
fight
lessened
his
attacks
on
and
finally
stopped
them
altogether
never
did
find
out
if
was
really
responsible
for
the
letter
strategy
had
been
immensely
successful
took
a
long
time
to
realize
what
had
done
and
it
had
a
profound
effect
on
him
he
learned
a
lesson
he
never
forgot
it
the
next
few
months
of
comparative
silence
waited
patiently
until
conditions
were
perfect
for
a
new
attack
and
then
displaying
a
remarkable
grasp
of
the
subtleties
of
political
infighting
gained
from
his
first
bout
with
he
used
these

conditions
to
excellent
advantage

the
incident

rift
began
to
develop
between

frugally
honest
had
been
the
ideal
man
to
assume
office
in

the
disgraceful
antics
of
political
bosses

and
he
ruled
the
state
with
an
iron
fist
tolerating
no
nonsense

supported
him
all
the
way
both
as
a
chief

as
a
man

abrupt
end

the

and
taking
note
of
the
recent
wave
of
corruption
in
the
legislature
left
it
to
the
governor
to
award
the
contract
wanted
this
political
windfall
very
badly
and
everyone
assumed
that
he
would
get
it
because
he
was
a
close
friend
of
the
governor
and
his
stanchest
supporter
all
owned
a
competent
printing
plant
and
was
the
logical
man
for
the
job
because
the
governor
was
determined
that
friendship
should
not
influence
him
one
way
or
the
other
he
looked
for
a
printer
with
a
knowledge
of
the
law
which
did
not
have
and
awarded
the
contract
to
a
lawyer
named
who
had
started
a
newspaper
in
the
year
before
was
furious
the
act
a
personal
rebuff
he
aired
his
feelings
in
on
think
the
governor
treated
us
rather
shabbily
to
say
the
least
of
it
is
but
justice
to
for
us
to
add
that
in
the
above
remarks
nothing
is
intended
to
his
disparagement
either
as
a
lawyer
or
as
a
printer
got
a
good
fat
job
and
we
congratulate
him
on
his
good
luck
hope
that
he
will
execute
it
in
a
manner
that
will
entitle
him
to
credit
summer
cooled
into
fall
and
winter
even
so
the
relationship
between
the
two
men
continued
to
grow
colder
by
the
day
and
by
of
it
was
icy
was
at
this
point
that
decided
to
capitalize
on
the
bad
feelings
between
the
two
men
eventual
prize
in
this
new
battle
was
the
public
printing
contract
that
still
held
his
first
bout
with
the
canny
had
learned
that
it
was
better
not
to
attack
him
directly
so
harping
on
the
theme
that
the
cost
of
printing
was
too
high
he
condemned
the
governor
for
permitting
such
a
state
of
affairs
to
exist
document
his
charge
set
up
two
parallel
columns
in
showing
the
price
charged
by
and
the
considerably
lower
price
for
which
the
work
could
be
done
elsewhere
he
called
on
the
governor
to
explain
why
governor
was
not
used
to
having
his
integrity
questioned
and
he
promptly
passed
the
charges
on
to
demanding
that
answer
them
could
not
furnish
a
strong
explanation
the
governor
insisted
that
he
lower
his
prices
in
accord
with
the
scale
printed
in
was
now
impaled
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
a
proud
man
his
prestige
would
suffer
if
he
let
dictate
to
him
through
the
office
but
to
lower
his
prices
would
be
tantamount
to
an
admission
that
they
had
been
too
high
in
the
first
place
a
consequence
he
did
neither
angry
at
the
governor
used
his
personal
influence
to
have
the
printing
contract
withdrawn
from
and
awarded
to
the
lowest
bidder
which
by
a
strange
coincidence
happened
to
be
for
the
moment
at
least
the
governor
now
found
himself
allied
with
the
head
of
the
faction
he
had
formerly
opposed
and
was
credited
with
a
clear
triumph
over
in
the
confused
atmosphere
of
frontier
politics

as
quickly
broken
as
they
were
formed

bulk
of
his
early
reputation
however
came
not
from
his
poetry

from
his
excellence

an
orator

reached

high

night

the

woman
not

what

with
was
not

appeared

her

what

unconquerable
was
residing
at
after
having
been
excommunicated
by
the

and
thrown
out
of

can
imagine
that
with
her
and
there
it
was
no
place
for
anyone
with
weak
nerves
who
was
running
the
colony
felt
constrained
to
move
seven
miles
south
where
with
others
as
mentioned
above
he
founded
in
the
two

united
under

the
union
was
irregular
and
illegally
constituted
and
that
it
had
never
been
sanctioned
by
the
majority
of
freeholders
he
became
involved
in
a
ruckus
remarkably
similar
to
the
one
in
cow
owned
by
an
old
woman
trespassed
on
land
driving
the
cow
back
home
the
woman
was
assaulted
by

complained
to
the
deputy

who
ordered
the
servant
brought
before
the
court
reverted
to
his
tactics
refused
to
let
her
go
and
appeared
himself
before
the
grand
jury
the
trial
he
told
off
the
jury
called
them
and
called
a
freeman
a
saucy
boy
and
was
jailed
and
banished
then
moved
to
and
soon
put
the
town
in
a
turmoil
held
that
no
group
of
colonists
could
set
up
or
maintain
a
government
without
royal
sanction
at
that
time
did
not
have
such
sanction
his
opinion
was
not
popular
wrote
his
friend
as
follows
having
foully
abused
high
and
low
at
is
now
bewitching
and
bemaddening
poor
both
with
his
unclean
and
foul
censures
of
all
the
ministers
of
this
country
for
which
myself
have
in
name
withstood
him
and
also
denying
all
visible
and
external
ordinances
in
depth
of
almost
all
suck
in
his
poison
as
at
first
they
did
at
few
and
myself
withstand
his
inhabitation
and
town
privileges
without
confession
and
reformation
of
his
uncivil
and
inhuman
practices
at
yet
the
tide
is
too
strong
against
us
and
fear
if
the
framer
of
hearts
help
not
it
will
force
me
to
little
a
little

next
to

stated

like
the
peace
of
a
man
who
hath
the

finally
managed
to
get
out
of
the
town

he
and
some
friends
bought
land
at
on
the

side
of
five
miles
south

still

now
that

away
from
it

started
looking
for
him
intelligence
that
the
formidable
agitator
was
to

them
with
his
presence
the
benighted
inhabitants
of
alas
gave
their
allegiance

asked
that

to
expel
the
newcomers
it
was
the
custom
of
that
alert
colony
to
take
over
the
property
of
persons
asking
for
protection
this
was
an
act
roughly
equivalent
to
throwing
open
the
door
to
a
pack
of
wolves
and
saying

get
it

him
he
was
very
tired

that
he

enjoyed
greatly
the
trip
downtown
been
cooped
up
so
long
he
added
out
again
seeing
old
friends
had
given
his
spirits
a
lift
night
after
supper
went
back
over
to
and
at
that
time
were
living
at
and
went
with
me
was
still
elated
over
his
afternoon
visit
downtown
saw
a
lot
of
old
friends
seen
in
a
long
time
he
told
me
his
eyes
bright
was
mighty
good
for
the
old
man
to
get
out
again
next
day
he
seemed
to
be
in
fairly
good
shape
and
still
in
excellent
spirits
a
few
days
after
return
he
began
hemorrhaging
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
early
and
complete
disintegration
began
in
the
morning
and
very
quickly
the
hemorrhage
was
a
massive
one
got
to
him
as
quickly
as
we
could
and
we
wired
of
desperate
condition
hemorrhage
was
in
the
prostate
region
saw
at
once
what
had
happened
has
lost
much
blood
he
said
take
a
lot
to
replace
it
got
a
lot
of
blood
spoke
up
plenty
of
it
me
give
blood
doctor
agreed
but
explained
that
it
would
be
necessary
first
to
check
blood
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
it
was
of
the
same
type
as
give
a
patient
the
wrong
type
of
blood
said
the
doctor
would
likely
kill
him
was
in
the
days
before
blood
banks
of
course
and
transfusions
had
to
be
given
directly
from
donor
to
patient
had
to
find
a
donor
and
usually
very
quickly
whose
blood
corresponded
with
the
then
it
took
considerably
longer
to
make
preparations
for
giving
transfusions
had
to
take
blood
samples
to
the
laboratory
to
test
them
for
one
thing
and
there
was
much
required
preliminary
procedure
made
the
tests
and
came
to
by
now
it
was
perhaps
two
days
or
longer
after
had
begun
hemorrhaging
your
blood
matches
your
all
right
said
we
going
to
let
you
give
him
any
why
in

my

it

him
no
good

shortly
after

home
the
of

in
declining
health
for
many
years
and
death
was
not
unexpected

sketch
followed
services
were
held
afternoon
at
four
at
the
home
our
pastor
was
in
charge
burial
was
out
in
about
him
stood
tombstones
his
own
sensitive
great
hands
had
fashioned
few
years
before
his
death
had
agreed
with
to
make
a
joint
will
with
her
in
which
it
would
be
provided
that
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
either
of
them
an
accounting
would
be
made
to
their
children
whereby
each
child
would
receive
a
bequest
of
cash
his
death
and
my
husband
were
named
executors
of
the
estate
under
the
terms
of
the
will
and
qualified
as
executors
and
paid
off
what
debts
were
currently
due
and
they
were
all
current
since
was
never
one
to
allow
bills
to
go
unpaid
bills
were
principally
for
hospitalization
and
fees
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
when
he
died
he
owed
in
the
main
only
current
bills
they
had
paid
all
his
debts
and
the
funeral
costs
and
had
some
fourteen
thousand
dollars
as
remember
with
which
to
pay
the
bequests
manifestly
would
not
provide
to
each
of
the
surviving
five
children
what
and
did
was
to
attempt
to
prorate
the
money
fairly
by
taking
into
account
what
each
of
the
five
had
received
if
anything
from
the
estate
before
death
and
the
two
who
had
been
provided

educations
signed
statements
to
the
effect
that
each
had
received
his
bequest
in
full
and
and
were
each
allotted
had
been
given
about
half
his
legacy
to
use
in
a
business
venture
before
death
he
was
given
the
difference
between
that
amount
and
had
received
four
years
of
education
at
the
of
and
two
at
and
had
been
in
and
out
of
and
and
part
of
the
time
had
been
a
student
because
he
had
received
less
than
it
was
felt
proper
that
should
receive
the
few
hundred
dollars
that
remained
how
estate
was
divided
should
emphasize
had
been
an
invalid
the
last
several
years
of
his
life
his
hospital
and
doctor
bills
had
been
large
and
his
income
had
been
cut
until
he
was
receiving
little
except
small
rentals
on
some
properties
he
still
owned
he
been
able
to
escape
this
long
siege
of
invalidism
convinced
would
have
left
a
sizable
estate
he
had
succeeded
well
we
agreed
had
left
us
a
legacy
far
more
valuable
than
houses
and
lands
and
stocks
and
bonds
years
and
had
been
large
taxpayers
recall
that
several
years
their
taxes
exceeded
those
years
of
lower
property
valuations
and
lower
tax
rates
that
payment
represented
ownership
of
much
property
have
known
to
exclaim
on
getting
his
tax
bill
going
to
the
dogs
he
never
expected
to
do
that
he
by
a
long
shot
the
spring
of
his
second
year
at
had
been
offered
a
job
at
as
an
instructor
in
the
he
had
delayed
accepting
this
job
and
as
he
was
leaving
to
come
home
to
in
response
to
our
telegram
he
dropped
a
postcard
to
head
of
the
asking
her
please
to
write
authorities
and
explain
the
circumstances
had
been
postponing
giving
them
an
answer
confident
because
he
did
not
want
to
go
out
there
to
teach
fact
he
want
to
teach
anywhere
wanted
to
go
back
to
for
another
year
of
playwriting
death
had
further
complicated
the
financing
of
third
year
and
for
the
weeks
following
it
did
not
know
whether
his
return
to
could
be
arranged
things
were
worked
out
in
the
family
and
late
in
he
wrote
an
explanatory
letter
in
which
he
told
her
that
matters
at
home
had
been
in
an
unsettled
condition
after
death
and
he
had
not
known
whether
he
would
stay
at
home
with
accept
the
job
or
return
to
he
was
happy
to
tell
her
that
his
finances
were
now
in
such
condition
that
he
could
go
back
to
for
a
third
year
with
what
he
did
third
year
he
wrote
plays
with
a
fury
believe
there
are
seventeen
short
plays
by
now
housed
in
the
at
think
right
in
that
figure
fall
he
submitted
to
the
first
acts
and
outlines
of
the
following
acts
of
several
plays
six
of
them
according
to
some
of
his
associates
and
he
also
worked
on
a
play
that
he
first
called
the
material
for
which
he
had
collected
during
the
summer
at
home
this
play
would
be
called
the
spring
it
must
have
been
he
began
working
on
the
play
that
he
called

later
would
be

selected
for
production
by
the
and
it
was
staged
in
the
middle
of
ran
two
nights
and
though
it
was
generally
praised
there
was
considerable
criticism
of
its
length
ran
until
past
one
was
weakness
it
was
demonstrated
many
critics
would
later
point
out
in
the
length
of
his
novels
this
play
there
were
so
many
characters
and
so
much
detail
never
knew
how
to
condense
to
boil
down
was
always
concerned
with
life
and
he
tried
to
picture
it
whole
he
wanted
nothing
compressed
tight
was
a
big
man
and
he
wanted
nothing
little
squeezed
he
despised
parsimony
and
particularly
of
words
this
play
there
were
some
thirty
or
more
named
characters
and
know
how
many
more
unnamed
describing
it
to
after
it
had
been
chosen
for
production
he
defended
his
great
array
of
characters
by
declaring
that
he
had
included
that
many
not
because
know
how
to
save
paint
but
because
the
play
required
them
he
threatened
someday
to
write
a
play
with
fifty
eighty
a
hundred
people
a
whole
town
a
whole
race
a
whole
epoch
said
he
would
do
it
though
probably
nobody
would
produce
it
for
his
own
ease
and
comfort
summer
attended
the
summer
session
at
but
he
did
not
ask
to
send
him
back
in
the
fall
he
went
down
to
and
submitted
to
the
which
had
asked
him
to
let
them
have
a
look
at
it
after
had
recommended
it
highly
hung
around
waiting
to
hear
whether
they
would
accept
it
for
production
and
in
that
time
came
down
to
and
also
paid
a
short
visit
to
where
with
almost
childish
delight
he
visited
old
friends
and
favorite
campus
spots
returning
to
he
had
a
job
for
several
weeks
it
was
visiting
of
alumni
in
to
ask
them
for
contributions
to
the
fund
would
be
the
campus
student
union
honoring
the
late
and
much
beloved
who
had
been
president
when
entered
the
university
the
kept
that
play
and
kept
it
and
finally
in
they
turned
it
down
they
would
reconsider
it
they
assured
him
if
he
would
rewrite
it
told
me
about
it
how
one
evening
he
went
over
to
see
the
man
man
said
had
the
play
shut
up
in
his
desk
believe
and
when
sat
down
he
pulled
it
out
and
apologetically
told
that
they
be
able
to
use
it
said
he
almost
burst
into
tears
he
was
so
disappointed
and
put
out
man
said
explained
that
it
was
not
only
too
long
and
detailed
but
that
as
it
stood
it
the
sort
of
thing
the
public
wanted
public
said
the
man
told
him
wanted
realism
and
his
play
that
was
fantastic
writing
beautiful
writing
the
man
declared
but
the
public
he
insisted
wanted
realism
was
not
willing
to
revise
the
play
according
to
the
plan
the
man
suggested
a
revision
he
said
would
ruin
it
would
change
his
whole
conception
of
the
play
as
well
as
the
treatment
thought
about
it
and
he
told
the
man
he
just
do
it
over
in
accordance
with
the
suggestions
he
had
made
was
not
until
we
had
returned
to
the
city
to
live
while
was
still
at
and
that
felt
the
full
impact
of
evangelical
came
under
the
spell
of
a
younger
group
in
the
church
led
by
the
older
son
spirit
of
this
group
was
that
we
were
and
are
living
in
a
world
doomed
to
eternal
punishment
but
that
through
has
provided
a
way
of
escape
for
those
who
confess
their
sins
and
accept
salvation
are
millions
who
accept
this
doctrine
but
few
indeed
are
those
who
accept
it
so
truly
that
the
fate
of
humanity
lies
as
a
weight
on
their
souls
night
and
day
group
in
was
made
up
of
the
earnest
few
was
drawn
deeper
and
deeper
into
these
concerns
and
responsibilities
engaged
more
and
more
in
religious
activities
and
went
to
meetings
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
church
door
went
to
an
afternoon
service
at
the
went
to
the
and
to
the
evening
service
of
the
church
of
this
lacked
the
active
support
of
the
pastor
young
people
were
and
was
energized
or
twice
my
father
asked
me
if
overdoing
a
bit
in
my
churchgoing
myself
was
not
yet
saved
least
had
been
unable
to
lay
hold
on
the
experience
of
conversion
as
might
to
confess
my
sins
and
accept
salvation
no
answer
came
to
me
from
heaven
after
years
gave
up
basic
difficulty
suppose
was
in
my
ultimate
inability
to
feel
a
burden
of
sin
from
which
sought
relief
was
familiar
with
which
read
as
literature
load
of
sin
had
been
laid
on
my
shoulders
nor
did
earnest
effort
enable
me
to
become
conscious
of
one
is
of
course
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
which
asserts
that
each
of
us
as
individuals
partakes
of
the
guilt
of
our
first
ancestor
the
rhyming
catechism
this
doctrine
is
worded
thus
fall
all
doctrine
was
repugnant
to
my
moral
sense
did
not
feel
it
presumptuous
to
expect
that
the
would
be
at
least
as
just
as
the
most
righteous
of
creatures
and
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
is
compounded
of
injustice
of
these
thoughts
not
all
of
them
have
taken
organized
form
in
later
years
actual
impelling
force
which
severed
me
from
evangelical
effort
was
of
another
sort
became
disgusted
at
being
so
preoccupied
with
the
state
of
my
own
miserable
soul
found
myself
becoming
one
of
that
group
of
people
who
in
words
are
forever
gazing
into
their
own
navels
anxiously
asking
right
am
wrong
bethought
me
of
the
and
these
words
came
to
mind
kingdom
come
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
have
remained
on
the
opened
page
of
my
mind
in
all
the
years
which
since
have
passed
that
time
to
this
my
religious
concern
is
that
might
give
effective
help
to
the
bringing
in
of
kingdom
on
earth
do
not
claim
to
be
free
from
sin
or
from
the
need
for
repentance
and
forgiveness
my
experience
the
assurance
of
forgiveness
comes
only
when
have
confessed
to
the
wronged
one
and
have
made
as
full
reparation
as
can
devise
was
one
further
step
in
my
religious
progress
was
taken
after
came
to
live
in
and
it
was
made
under
the
guidance
of
the
a
young
preacher
who
came
to
the
there
at
about
the
same
time
that
moved
from
father
was
a
professor
at
and
from
him
he
acquired
a
conviction
which
he
passed
along
to
me
that
there
is
in
the
universe
of
persons
a
moral
law
the
law
of
love
which
is
a
natural
law
in
the
same
sense
as
is
the
physical
law
is
most
important
that
we
recognize
the
law
of
love
as
being
unbreakable
in
all
personal
relationships
whether
individually
socially
or
as
between
whole
nations
of
people
obeyed
the
law
brings
order
and
satisfaction
disobeyed
the
result
is
turmoil
and
chaos
we
observe
moral
law
and
physical
law
they
appear
as
being
inevitable
can
conceive
of
no
alternatives
basis
seems
deeper
than
mere
authority
are
not
true
because
scientists
or
prophets
say
they
are
true
is
not
the
authority
of
which
makes
them
true
is
what
is
the
laws
of
the
universe
material
and
spiritual
are
what
they
are
and
are
one
and
inseparable
this
conviction
the
partition
between
the
sacred
and
the
secular
disappears
daily
work
becomes
sacred
since
it
is
performed
in
the
field
of
influence
of
the
moral
law
dealing
as
it
does
with
people
as
well
as
with
matter
and
energy
his
book
faces
the
moral
problems
which
arise
when
moral
law
is
recognized
in
business
life
for
example
defines
possessions
as
the
property
of
the
community
of
which
the
individual
is
sovereign
steward
serves
society
by
conducting
a
business
from
which
a
certain
number
of
employees
draw
their
means
of
subsistence
another
by
giving
away
his
property
in
order
to
help
his
fellow
man
will
decide
on
his
own
course
somewhere
between
these
two
extreme
cases
according
to
the
sense
of
responsibility
which
is
determined
for
him
by
the
particular
circumstances
of
his
own
life
one
is
to
judge
others
is
uncompromising
in
assigning
guilt
to
the
man
who
finds
it
necessary
to
inflict
or
permit
injury
to
one
individual
or
group
for
the
sake
of
a
larger
good
this
decision
a
man
must
take
personal
responsibility
he
may
never
imagine
that
in
the
struggle
between
personal
and
responsibility
it
is
possible
to
make
a
compromise
between
the
ethical
and
the
purposive
in
the
shape
of
a
relative
ethic
or
to
let
the
ethical
be
superseded
by
the
purposive
the
contrary
it
is
my
duty
to
make
my
own
decision
as
between
the
two
seems
in
fact
to
acquire
for
himself
a
burden
of
sin
not
bequeathed
by
but
accumulated
in
the
inevitable
judgments
which
life
requires
of
him
as
between
greater
and
lesser
responsibilities
viewpoint
find
interesting
but
it
has
never
weighed
on
my
soul
it
should
have
own
experience
has
followed
simpler
lines
uncompromising
belief
in
the
moral
law
has
the
advantage
of
making
religion
natural
even
as
physical
law
is
natural
the
engineer
nor
the
ordinary
citizen
feels
any
in
obeying
the
laws
of
matter
and
energy
nor
can
he
achieve
a
sense
of
in
such
obedience
obey
the
moral
law
is
just
ordinary
common
sense
applied
to
a
neglected
field
thus
becomes
integrated
with
life
truth
that
the
moral
law
is
natural
has
other
important
corollaries
of
them
is
that
it
gives
meaning
and
purpose
to
life
seeking
for
such
meaning
and
purpose
seized
upon
the
concept
of
the
sacredness
of
life
is
puzzling
to
the
occidental
mind
to
mine
at
least
to
assign
sacredness
to
animal
insect
and
plant
life
lives
are
in
themselves
outside
of
the
moral
order
and
are
unburdened
with
moral
responsibility
is
indeed
a
moral
responsibility
on
man
himself
for
his
own
sake
to
respect
lower
life
and
to
avoid
the
infliction
of
suffering
but
this
viewpoint
rejects
far
as
sacredness
inheres
in
any
aspect
of
creation
it
seems
to
me
to
be
found
in
human
personality
whether
in
or
in
cannot
read
the
records
of
scientists
officials
and
travelers
who
have
penetrated
to
the
minds
of
the
most
savage
races
without
realizing
that
each
individual
met
with
is
a
person
for
instance
in
of
and
her
wise
father
and
her
final
adjustment
to
encroaching
civilization
all
read
in
the
old
man
of
the
tribe
not
cannibals
in
central
gave
to
the
white
man
his
choicest
possession
while
the
tears
streamed
down
his
face
aborigine
is
the
conventional
exemplar
of
degraded
humanity
yet
here
was
a
depth
of
sensibility
which
is
lacking
in
a
considerable
portion
of
the
beneficiaries
of
our
civilization
whether
white
black
brown
or
yellow
are
a
concern
of
for
personality
is
a
privilege
and
a
duty
for
us
as
brothers
is
the
field
for
exercising
our
reverence
to
our
action
let
us
align
ourselves
with
the
purpose
expressed
by
in
the
kingdom
come
will
be
done
on
earth
as
it
is
in
heaven
the
knowledge
that
the
kingdom
comes
by
obedience
to
the
moral
law
in
our
relations
with
all
people
we
have
a
firm
intellectual
grasp
on
both
the
means
and
the
ends
of
our
lives
intellectual
approach
to
spiritual
life
suited
me
well
because
was
never
content
to
lead
a
divided
life
have
said
words
from
remain
ever
in
my
memory
mind
and
soul
according
well
make
one
music
as
before
us
now
give
some
thought
to
the
soul
the
young
biologist
began
to
show
interest
in
our
daughter
this
induced
a
corresponding
interest
on
our
part
in
him
asked
one
day
what
he
was
doing
told
me
that
he
had
a
big
newt
and
a
little
newt
and
that
he
was
transplanting
a
big
eye
of
the
big
newt
onto
the
little
newt
and
a
little
eye
of
the
little
newt
onto
the
big
newt
was
then
noting
that
the
big
eye
on
the
little
newt
hung
back
until
the
little
eye
had
grown
up
to
it
while
the
little
eye
on
the
big
newt
grew
rapidly
until
it
was
as
big
as
the
other
asked
does
that
teach
you
he
teaches
me
to
wonder
was
a
profound
statement
the
face
of
the
unfolding
universe
our
ultimate
attitude
is
that
of
wonder
is
indeed
the
intellectual
gateway
to
the
spiritual
world
are
the
days
when
in
the
nineteenth
century
scientists
thought
that
they
were
close
to
the
attainment
of
complete
knowledge
of
the
physical
universe
them
only
a
little
more
needed
to
be
learned
and
then
all
physical
knowledge
could
be
neatly
sorted
packaged
and
put
in
the
inventory
to
be
drawn
on
for
the
solution
of
any
human
problem
complacency
was
blown
to
bits
by
the
relativity
of
the
revelation
of
the
complex
anatomy
of
the
atom
and
the
discovery
of
the
expanding
universe
of
these
discoveries
were
neatly
rounded
off
bits
of
knowledge
faded
out
into
the
unexplored
areas
of
the
future
is
as
if
we
in
our
center
of
human
observation
from
time
to
time
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
unknown
our
radius
of
penetration
increases
the
area
of
new
knowledge
increases
by
and
the
total
of
human
knowledge
becomes
measured
in
terms
of
grows
is
endless
are
some
people
intelligent
people
who
seem
to
be
untouched
by
the
sea
of
wonder
in
which
we
are
immersed
and
in
which
we
spend
our
lives
such
is
the
writer
of
a
recent
book
is
a
straightforward
denial
of
the
spiritual
world
and
a
vigorous
defense
of
pure
materialism
inability
to
wonder
vitiates
his
argument
subject
of
immortality
brings
to
mind
a
vivid
incident
which
took
place
in
at
in
is
as
old
as
literary
art
and
we
can
set
the
stage
for
our
study
of
three
moderns
if
we
see
how
certain
critics
in
the
past
have
dealt
with
the
ethical
aspects
of
literature
have
chosen
five
contrasting
pairs
ten
men
in
all
and
they
are
arranged
in
roughly
chronological
order
a
list
must
naturally
be
selective
and
the
treatment
of
each
man
is
brief
for
am
interested
only
in
their
general
ideas
on
the
moral
measure
of
literature
the
list
will
give
us
considerable
variety
in
attitudes
and
some
typical
ones
for
these
critics
range
all
the
way
from
censors
to
those
who
consider
art
above
ethics
all
the
way
from
to
most
of
the
great
periods
are
represented
because
we
will
compare
and
from
the
golden
age
of
and
from
renaissance
and
of
the
eighteenth
and
early
nineteenth
centuries
in
and
and
of
nineteenth
century
letters
and
and
agree
on
some
vital
literary
issues
both
measure
literature
by
moral
standards
and
in
their
political
writings
both
allow
for
censorship
but
the
differences
between
them
are
also
significant
censors
literature
only
for
the
young
would
banish
all
poets
from
his
ideal
state
more
important
in
his
differs
somewhat
from
when
he
moves
in
the
direction
of
treating
literature
as
a
unique
thing
separate
and
apart
from
its
causes
and
its
effects
through
attends
to
the
way
art
relates
to
the
general
life
and
ultimately
to
a
good
life
for
his
citizens
short
he
is
constantly
concerned
with
the
ethical
effects
he
discusses
the
subject
matter
of
poetry
he
asks
what
moral
effect
the
scenes
will
have
he
turns
briefly
to
literary
style
in
the
he
again
looks
to
the
effect
on
the
audience
explains
that
his
citizens
must
not
be
corrupted
by
any
of
the
misrepresentations
of
the
gods
or
heroes
that
one
finds
in
much
poetry
and
he
observes
that
all
these
pantomimic
gentlemen
will
be
sent
to
another
state
those
story
tellers
will
remain
who
can
imitate
the
style
of
the
virtuous
is
at
times
just
as
suspicious
of
the
poets
themselves
as
he
is
of
their
work
he
discusses
tyrants
in
the
of
he
pictures
the
poets
as
willing
to
praise
the
worst
rulers
the
most
fundamental
objection
he
has
to
poets
appears
in
the
and
it
is
derived
from
his
doctrine
of
ideal
forms
mind
there
is
an
irresolvable
conflict
between
the
poet
and
the
philosopher
because
the
poet
imitates
only
particular
objects
and
is
incapable
of
rising
to
the
first
level
of
abstraction
much
less
the
highest
level
of
ideal
forms
reality
of
course
is
the
ideal
and
the
poet
knows
nothing
of
this
only
the
philosopher
knows
the
truth
moreover
dwell
on
human
passions
with
this
point
about
the
passions
we
encounter
dualism
same
sort
of
thinking
plays
so
large
a
part
in
both
and
that
we
must
examine
it
in
some
detail
feels
that
man
has
two
competing
aspects
his
rational
faculty
and
his
irrational
can
be
virtuous
only
if
we
control
our
lower
natures
the
passions
in
this
case
and
strengthen
our
rational
side
and
poetry
with
all
its
emphasis
on
the
passions
encourages
the
audience
to
give
way
to
emotion
this
reason
then
poetry
tends
to
weaken
the
power
of
control
the
reason
because
it
tempts
one
to
indulge
his
passions
and
even
the
best
of
men
he
maintains
may
be
corrupted
by
this
subtle
influence
attitude
toward
poetry
has
always
been
something
of
an
enigma
because
he
is
so
completely
sensitive
to
its
charm
whole
objection
indeed
seems
to
rise
out
of
a
deep
conviction
that
the
poets
do
have
great
power
to
influence
but
seldom
pays
any
attention
to
what
might
be
called
the
poem
itself
is
rather
concerned
with
the
effect
on
society
and
he
wants
the
poets
to
join
his
fight
for
justice
wants
them
to
use
their
great
power
to
strengthen
rational
side
to
teach
virtue
and
to
encourage
religion
finally
allows
a
few
acceptable
hymns
to
the
gods
and
famous
men
still
he
clearly
leaves
the
way
open
for
further
discussion
of
the
issue
even
calls
upon
the
poets
to
defend
the
and
to
show
that
poetry
may
contribute
to
virtue
says
may
further
grant
to
those
of
her
defenders
who
are
lovers
of
poetry
and
yet

the
permission
to
speak
in
prose
on
her
behalf
let
them
show
not
only
that
she
is
pleasant
but
also
useful
to
and
to
human
life
and
we
will
listen
in
a
kindly
spirit
for
if
this
can
be
proved
we
shall
surely
be
the
gainers
mean
if
there
is
a
use
in
poetry
as
well
as
a
delight
we
turn
to
ideas
on
the
moral
measure
of
literature
it
is
at
once
apparent
that
he
is
at
times
equally
concerned
about
the
influence
of
the
art
the
ideal
state
for
instance
he
argues
that
the
young
citizens
should
hear
only
the
most
carefully
selected
tales
and
stories
this
reason
he
would
banish
indecent
pictures
and
speeches
from
the
stage
and
the
young
people
should
not
even
be
permitted
to
see
comedies
till
they
are
old
enough
to
drink
strong
wine
and
sit
at
the
public
tables
the
time
they
reach
that
age
however
no
longer
worries
about
the
evil
influence
of
comedies
analysis
of
tragedy
in
the
we
find
an
attempt
to
isolate
the
art
to
consider
only
those
things
proper
to
it
to
discover
how
it
differs
from
other
arts
and
to
deal
with
the
effects
peculiar
to
it
assures
us
early
in
the
that
all
art
is
imitation
and
that
all
imitation
gives
pleasure
but
he
distinguishes
between
art
in
general
and
poetic
art
on
the
basis
of
the
means
manner
and
the
objects
of
the
imitation
the
poetic
arts
are
separated
from
the
other
forms
he
lays
down
his
famous
definition
of
tragedy
which
sets
up
standards
and
so
lends
direction
to
the
remainder
of
the
work
tragedy
by
his
definition
is
an
imitation
of
an
action
that
is
serious
of
a
certain
magnitude
and
complete
in
itself
should
have
a
dramatic
form
with
pleasing
language
and
it
should
portray
incidents
which
so
arouse
pity
and
fear
that
it
purges
these
emotions
in
the
audience
tragedy
he
maintains
has
six
elements
plot
character
and
thought
the
objects
of
imitation
diction
and
melody
the
means
of
imitation
and
spectacle
the
manner
of
imitation
the
rest
of
the
continues
to
discuss
the
characteristics
of
these
six
parts
and
their
interrelationship
and
he
refers
frequently
to
the
standards
suggested
by
his
definition
of
tragedy
method
in
the
then
does
suggest
that
we
should
isolate
the
work
contingent
of
modern
critics
follow
so
far
in
this
direction
that
it
is
hard
to
see
how
they
can
compare
one
poem
with
another
for
the
purpose
of
evaluation
there
are
however
several
features
of
approach
which
open
the
way
for
the
moral
measure
of
literature
one
thing
mentions
that
plays
may
corrupt
the
audience
addition
his
definition
of
a
tragedy
invites
our
attention
because
a
serious
and
important
action
may
very
well
be
one
that
tests
the
moral
fiber
of
the
author
or
of
the
characters
there
is
one
other
point
in
the
that
invites
moral
evaluation
notion
that
the
distinctive
function
of
tragedy
is
to
purge
emotions
by
arousing
pity
and
fear
rejects
certain
plots
because
they
do
not
contribute
to
that
end
point
is
that
an
ethical
critic
with
an
assist
from
can
seize
on
this
theory
to
argue
that
tragedy
provides
us
with
a
harmless
outlet
for
our
hostile
urges
his
study
takes
this
line
when
he
says
that
what
really
means
by
his
theory
of
catharsis
is
that
our
evil
passions
may
be
so
purged
by
the
dramatic
ritual
that
it
is
less
likely
that
we
shall
indulge
them
through
our
own
acts
view
this
is
one
way
to
show
how
literature
may
be
moral
in
effect
without
employing
the
explicit
methods
of
a
moralist
we
can
add
that
interpretation
of
purgation
is
also
one
answer
to
fear
that
poetry
will
encourage
our
passions
is
correct
tragedy
may
have
quite
the
opposite
effect
may
allay
our
passions
and
so
restore
the
rule
of
reason
in
more
terms
the
experience
may
serve
to
sublimate
our
destructive
urges
and
strengthen
the
ego
and
superego
and
second
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
in
was
the
setting
for
a
violent
and
long
controversy
over
the
moral
quality
of
renaissance
literature
especially
the
drama
one
suggested
that
the
ethical
effects
of
the
art
were
irrelevant
sides
agreed
that
the
theater
must
stand
a
moral
test
but
they
could
not
agree
on
whether
the
poets
were
a
good
or
a
bad
influence
sides
claimed
that
and
supported
their
cause
who
wanted
to
close
the
theaters
for
example
pointed
to
and
those
who
wished
to
keep
them
open
called
on
the
of
the
to
testify
in
their
behalf
most
famous
document
that
comes
out
of
this
dispute
is
perhaps
published
in
students
of
literature
know
that
classical
defense
is
not
so
well
known
however
and
what
is
quite
important
for
understanding
the
issues
of
this
early
quarrel
is
the
kind
of
attack
on
literature
that
was
answering
this
reason
then
want
to
describe
first
two
examples
of
the
puritanical
attacks
and
his
later
published
in
we
will
see
how
answered
the
charges
for
while
essay
was
not
specifically
a
reply
to
his
arguments
do
support
the
new
theater
to
study
the
theater
business
in
had
become
a
thriving
enterprise
by
and
in
the
opinion
of
many
a
thoroughly
bad
business
by
what
they
considered
an
evil
influence
some
members
of
the
clergy
joined
by
city
authorities
merchants
and
master
craftsmen
began
the
attack
on
the
plays
and
the
actors
for
what
they
called
the
abuses
of
the
art
but
by
some
of
them
began
to
denounce
the
whole
idea
of
acting
this
kind
of
wholesale
objection
came
at
first
from
some
men
who
were
not
technically
still
once
the
gained
power
they
climaxed
the
affair
by
passing
the
infamous
ordinance
of
which
decreed
that
all
public
shall
cease
and
be
forborne
that
act
of
the
opponents
of
the
stage
won
the
day
and
for
more
than
two
decades
after
that
had
no
legitimate
public
drama
the
early
days
of
this
controversy
over
the
theater
one
of
the
interested
parties
published
a
little
tract
in
which
he
objected
mildly
to
the
abuses
of
art
rather
than
the
art
itself
his
opposition
hardened
and
by
in
he
was
ready
to
banish
all
players
advises
women
to
beware
of
those
places
which
in
sorrows
cheere
you
and
beguile
you
in
mirth
does
not
really
approve
of
levity
and
laughter
but
sex
is
the
deadly
sin
warns
that
a
single
glance
can
lead
us
into
temptation
for
eies
have
lyking
hartes
and
lyking
hartes
may
burne
in
lust
it
would
not
be
very
satisfactory
to
leave
our
conclusions
at
the
point
just
reached
it
is
possible
to
be
somewhat
more
concrete
and
factual
in
diagnosing
the
involvement
of
values
in
education
this
purpose
we
now
draw
upon
data
from
sociological
and
psychological
studies
of
students
in
colleges
and
universities
and
particularly
from
the
the
latter
research
program
information
is
available
for
students
surveyed
in
and
for
students
surveyed
in
the
latter
sample
persons
had
been
studied
two
years
earlier
hence
changes
in
attitudes
and
values
can
be
analyzed
for
identical
individuals
at
two
points
in
time
addition
the
study
collected
comparable
data
from
students
at
ten
other
colleges
and
universities
scattered
across
the
country
of
at
and
find
in
the
first
place
that
the
students
overwhelmingly
approve
of
higher
education
positively
evaluate
the
job
their
own
institution
is
doing
do
not
accept
most
of
the
criticisms
levelled
against
higher
education
in
the
public
prints
and
on
the
whole
approve
of
the
way
their
university
deals
with
and
value
inculcation
is
not
our
impression
that
these
evaluations
are
naively
uncritical
resultants
of
blissful
ignorance
rather
the
generality
of
these
students
find
their
university
experience
congenial
to
their
own
sense
of
values
are
approximately
equally
divided
between
those
who
regard
vocational
preparation
as
the
primary
goal
of
an
ideal
education
and
those
who
chose
a
general
liberal
education
conceivable
goals
such
as
and
social
adjustment
are
of
secondary
importance
to
them
ideal
of
a
liberal
education
impresses
itself
upon
the
students
more
and
more
as
they
move
through
college
in
such
technical
curricula
as
engineering
the
senior
is
much
more
likely
than
the
freshman
to
choose
as
an
ideal
liberal
education
over
specific
vocational
preparation
the
university
milieu
of
scholarship
and
research
of
social
diversity
of
new
ideas
and
varied
and
interests
socialization
into
a
campus
culture
apparently
means
heightened
appreciation
of
the
idea
of
a
liberal
education
in
the
arts
and
sciences
choices
of
ideal
educational
goals
are
not
arbitrary
or
whimsical
is
a
clear
relationship
between
their
educational
evaluations
and
their
basic
pattern
of
general
values
selective
and
directional
qualities
of
basic
are
clearly
evident
in
these
data
the
students
choose

preparation
the
choose
goals
of
social
adjustment
getting
along
with
people
the
intellectuals
choose
a
liberal
arts
emphasis
same
patterned
consistency
shows
itself
in
occupational
choices
is
impressive
consistency
between
specific
occupational
preferences
and
the
basic
conception
of
what
is
for
him
a
good
way
of
life
contrary
to
many
popular
assertions
the
chosen
do
not
seem
to
us
to
be
primarily
oriented
to
materialistic
success
nor
to
mere
conformity
students
want
occupations
that
permit
them
to
use
their
talents
and
training
to
be
creative
and
original
to
work
with
and
to
help
other
people
also
want
money
prestige
and
security
they
are
optimistic
about
their
prospects
in
these
regards
they
set
limits
to
their
aspirations
few
aspire
to
millions
of
dollars
or
to
imperial
power
and
glory
the
fixed
frame
of
these
aspirations
they
can
afford
to
place
a
high
value
on
the
expressive
and
aspects
of
occupation
and
to
minimize
the
values
of
power
prestige
and
wealth
choices
are
also
useful
and
interesting
in
bringing
out
clearly
that
values
do
not
constitute
the
only
component
in
goals
and
aspirations
there
is
also
the
face
of
reality
in
the
form
of
the
perceptions
of
his
own
abilities
and
interests
of
the
objective
possibilities
open
to
him
of
the
familial
and
other
social
pressures
to
which
he
is
exposed
find
reluctant
recruits
whose
values
are
not
in
line
with
their
expected
characteristics
develop
occupational
images
not
always
accurate
or
detailed
and
they
try
to
fit
their
values
to
the
presumed
characteristics
of
the
imagined
occupation
purely
cognitive
or
informational
problems
are
often
acute
many
reluctant
recruits
are
yielding
to
social
demands
or
compromising
in
the
face
of
their
own
limitations
of
opportunity
or
of
ability
and
performance
many
a
aspirant
for
a
career
in
architecture
drama
or
journalism
resigns
himself
to
a
real
estate
business
many
a
student
who
dreams
of
the
decides
to
enter
his
advertising
agency
and
many
a
hopeful
incipient
business
executive
decides
it
were
better
to
teach
the
theory
of
business
administration
than
to
practice
it
old
ideal
of
the
independent
entrepreneur
is
extant
but
so
is
the
recognition
that
the
main
chance
may
be
in
a
corporate
bureaucracy
their
views
on
dating
courtship
sex
and
family
life
our
students
prefer
what
they
are
expected
to
prefer
them
in
the
grim
words
of
a
song
love
and
marriage
go
together
like
a
horse
and
carriage
expressed
standards
concerning
sex
roles
desirable
age
for
marriage
characteristics
of
an
ideal
mate
number
of
children
desired
are
congruent
with
the
values
and
stereotypes
of
the
preceding
generation
minus
compulsive
rebellion
even
accept
the
double
standard
of
sex
morality
in
a
double
sense
both
sexes
agree
that
standards
for
men
differ
from
standards
for
women
and
women
apply
to
both
sexes
a
standard
different
from
that
held
by
men
and
traditionalism
seem
implied
by
what
has
just
been
said
these
terms
are
treacherous
the
field
of
political
values
it
is
certainly
true
that
students
are
not
radical
not
rebels
against
their
parents
or
their
peers
as
they
go
through
college
the
students
tend
to
bring
their
political
position
in
line
with
that
prevalent
in
the
social
groups
to
which
they
belong
they
have
accepted
most
of
the
extant
welfare
state
provisions
for
health
security
and
the
regulation
of
economic
affairs
and
they
overwhelmingly
approve
of
the
traditional
liberalism
of
the
of
their
faith
in
civil
liberties
is
tested
against
strong
pressures
of
social
expediency
in
specific
issues
suppression
of
dangerous
ideas
many
waver
and
give
in
students
who
are
most
willing
to
acquiesce
in
the
suppression
of
civil
liberties
are
also
those
who
are
most
likely
to
be
prejudiced
against
minority
groups
to
be
conformist
and
traditionalistic
in
general
social
attitudes
and
to
lack
a
basic
faith
in
people
one
looks
at
the
existing
evidence
one
finds
a
correlation
although
only
a
slight
one
between
high
grades
and
libertarian
values
the
correlation
is
substantial
only
among
upperclassmen
other
words
as
students
go
through
college
those
who
are
most
successful
academically
tend
to
become
more
committed
to
a
of
orientation
in
gross
just
the
general
experience
may
have
varying
effects
but
the
students
who
are
successful
emerge
with
strengthened
and
clarified
democratic
values
finding
is
consistent
also
with
the
fact
that
student
leaders
are
more
likely
to
be
supporters
of
the
values
implicit
in
civil
liberties
than
the
other
students
is
now
substantial
evidence
from
several
major
studies
of
college
students
that
the
experience
of
the
college
years
results
in
a
certain
selective
homogenization
of
attitudes
and
values
from
their
prior
statuses
and
social
groups
and
exposed
to
the
pervasive
stimuli
of
the
university
milieu
the
students
tend
to
assimilate
a
new
common
culture
to
converge
toward
norms
characteristic
of
their
own
particular
campus
in
certain
respects
there
are
norms
common
to
colleges
and
universities
across
the
country
instance
people
consistently
show
up
in
study
after
study
as
more
often
than
others
supporters
of
the
of
and
other
democratic
rights
and
liberties
interesting
thing
in
this
connection
is
that
the
norms
upon
which
students
tend
to
converge
include
toleration
of
diversity
the
extent
that
our
sampling
of
the
orientations
of
college
students
in
the
years
and
may
be
representative
of
our
culture
and
still
valid
in
we
are
disposed
to
question
the
summary
characterization
of
the
current
generation
as
silent
beat
apathetic
or
as
a
mass
of
conformists
who
are
guided
solely
by
social
radar
without
benefit
of
inner
gyroscopes
data
indicate
that
these
students
of
today
do
basically
accept
the
existing
institutions
of
the
society
and
in
the
face
of
the
realities
of
complex
and
economic
and
political
problems
make
a
wary
and
ambivalent
delegation
of
trust
to
those
who
occupy
positions
of
legitimized
responsibility
for
coping
with
such
collective
concerns
a
real
sense
they
are
admittedly
conservative
but
their
conservatism
incorporates
a
traditionalized
embodiment
of
the
original
radicalism
of
we
have
no
measures
of
its
strength
or
intensity
the
heritage
of
the
doctrine
of
inalienable
rights
is
retained
they
move
through
the
college
years
our
young
men
and
women
are
socialized
into
a
broadly
similar
culture
at
the
level
of
personal
behavior
this
sense
also
they
are
surely
conformists
is
even
true
that
some
among
them
use
the
sheer
fact
of
conformity
everyone
does
it
as
a
criterion
for
conduct
the
extent
of
ethical
robotism
is
easily
overestimated
students
are
really
so
faceless
in
the
crowd
of
the
swelling
population
in
our
institutions
of
higher
learning
it
may
be
well
to
recall
that
to
say
conformity
is
in
part
another
way
of
saying
orderly
human
society
the
field
of
religious
beliefs
and
values
the
college
students
seem
to
faithfully
reflect
the
surrounding
culture
commitments
are
for
the
most
part
couched
in
a
familiar
idiom
testify
to
a
felt
need
for
a
religious
faith
or
ultimate
personal
philosophy
atheists
or
freethinkers
are
so
rare
as
to
be
a
curiosity
religious
quest
is
often
intense
and
deep
and
there
are
students
on
every
campus
who
are
seriously
wrestling
with
the
most
profound
questions
of
meaning
and
value
the
same
time
a
major
proportion
of
these
young
men
and
women
see
religion
as
a
means
of
personal
adjustment
an
anchor
for
family
life
a
source
of
emotional
security
personal
and
social
goals
often
overshadow
the
goals
of
intellectual
clarity
and
spiritual
transcendence
cult
of
adjustment
does
exist
exists
alongside
the
acceptance
of
traditional
forms
of
organized
religion
church
ordained
personnel
ritual
dogma
another
segment
of
the
student
population
consists
of
those
who
seek
in
what

that

orthodox

realize
that
we
have
very
few
reliable
historical
benchmarks
against
which
we
might
compare
the

that
conclusions
that

the

we
looked
more
intently
at
the

the
extent

we
received
the
impression
that
many
of
the

expressed
represented
a
conventional
acceptance
of
low
intensity
here

reason
for

that
the

think
to
take
advantage
of
the

of

matters
of

much
more
important
to
his

general
letter
of
a
few
days
later
from

is
highly
pleased
with
your
conduct
upon
this
occasion
by
now
the
original
cause
of
the
quarrel
seizure
of

only
one
strand
in
the
spider
web
of
interests
that
overlay
all
western
and
that
had
been
so
well
and
closely
spun
that
the
lightest
movement
could
set
it
trembling
from
one
end
to
the
other
so
ambassadors
can
scarcely
have
foreseen
that
five
years
of
unremitting
work
lay
ahead
of
them
before
peace
was
finally
made
and
that
when
it
did
come
the
countless
embassies
that
left
for
during
that
period
had
very
little
to
do
with
it
is
hard
not
to
lay
most
of
the
blame
for
their
failures
on
the
pope
is
hardly
an
impartial
witness
and
even
he
did
not
make
his
charges
against
until
the
latter
was
dead
but
there
is
some
truth
in
what
he
said
and
more
in
what
he
did
not
say
was
not
merely
a
hunger
for
money
gold
and
precious
objects
that
delayed
the
papal
pronouncement
that
could
have
brought
the
war
to
an
end
the
pope
was
playing
a
dangerous
game
with
so
many
balls
in
the
air
at
once
that
a
misstep
would
bring
them
all
about
his
ears
and
his
only
hope
was
to
temporize
so
that
he
could
take
advantage
of
every
change
in
the
delicate
balance
of
affairs
the
negotiations
began
his
quarrel
with
the
king
of
was
temporarily
in
abeyance
and
he
had
no
intention
of
reviving
it
so
long
as
there
was
hope
that
money
would
come
to
pay
the
troops
who
under
of
the
papal
vicar
of
were
so
valuable
in
the
crusade
against
the
cardinals
and
their
allies
his
circumspection
in
regard
to
sensibilities
went
so
far
that
he
even
refused
to
grant
a
dispensation
for
the
marriage
of
daughter
to
the
son
of
the
dauphin
of
a
truly
peacemaking
move
according
to
ideas
for
and
were
as
usual
fighting
on
opposite
sides
for
fear
that
he
might
seem
to
be
favoring
the
coalition
he
would
certainly
never
take
the
far
more
drastic
step
of
ordering
the
return
of
to
even
though
as
he
admitted
to
the
ambassadors
he
had
been
advised
that
the
original
cession
was
invalid
the
other
hand
he
did
not
want
to
offend
either
and
he

himself

a
very
difficult
position

of
the
of
that
he
had
any
justification
for
his
wars
but
in
the
triangle
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
recognize
the
claims
of
any
one
of
the
contestants
without
seeming
to
invalidate
those
of
the
other

the
impartiality
that
is
supposed
to
be
an
essential
qualification
for
the
position
of
arbiter
and
in
retrospect
that
would
seem
to
be
sufficient
reason
why

so
fruitless
when
the
situation
was
so
complicated
that
even
one
of
the
principal
actors
in
the
drama
could
misinterpret
the
motives
it
is
possible
that
and
his
companions
equally
baffled
attributed
their
difficulties
to
a
more
immediate
cause

monumental
tactlessness
by
its
very
derivation
implies
that
its
possessor
keeps
in
touch
with
other
people
but
the
author
of

the
wielder
of
the
two
swords

a
dim

above
other
human
beings

what
they
were

brilliant
man
one
of
the
best
jurists
in

with
flashes
of
penetrating
insight
and
yet
in
his
dealings
with
other
people
particularly
when
he
tried
to
be
ingratiating
he
was
capable
of
an
abysmal
stupidity
that
can
have
come
only
from
a
complete
incomprehension
of
human
nature

motives
lofty
disregard

the

caused
the
mischief

who
made

that
the
ruling
passion
of
their
race
was
covetousness

that
in
dealing
with

natural
that
he

completely
incomprehensible

he
made
no

was
a
terse

and
unscrupulous
with
a
ambition
to
which
he
devoted
all
his
energies
he
outmatched
the
diplomats

and
time
again
until
by
a
kind
of
poetic
justice
he
fell
at
the
battle

victim

unable

any

and
during

next
few
years
many
of

left

to
nothing
when
made

alliance

of
the
shifts
in
alliance
and
allegiance
not
only
increased
the
difficulties
confronting
the
embassy
as
a
whole
but
also
directly
involved
the
two
and
spite
of
the
armistice
negotiated
by
two
years
earlier
the
war
between
of
and
of
was
still
going
on
and
although
little
is
known
about
it
that
little
proves
that
it
was
yet
another
phase
of
the
struggle
against
expansion
and
was
closely
interwoven
with
the
larger
conflict
second
truce
had
been
arbitrated
in
by
lord
of
the
most
staunch
of
allies
and
these
last
were
represented
in
the
discussions
at
the
by
de
neighbor
and
a
member
of
the
coalition
although
in
many
of
these
discussions
and
might
have
been
tempted
to
consider
their
own
interests
as
well
as
those
of
the
king
confidence
in
them
was
so
absolute
that
they
were
made
the
acknowledged
leaders
of
the
embassy
may
have
owed
this
partly
to
his
relationship
with
the
king
but
who
at
sixty
seems
still
to
have
been
a
simple
knight
merited
his
position
solely
by
his
own
character
and
ability

relatively
new

pleasing
in
the
eyes
of
all

an
archbishop

boot

as
reliable
and
experienced
as
himself
all
the
reports
of
this
first
embassy
show
that
the
two
were
the
heads
of
it
for
they
were
the
only
ones
who
were
empowered
to
swear
for
the
king
that
he
would
abide
by
the
decision
and
who
were
allowed
to
appoint
deputies
in
the
event
that
one
was
unavoidably
absent
also
gave
them
the
unpleasant
duty
of
being
spokesmen
for
the
mission
and
they
could
foresee
that
that
would
not
be
easy
all
the
phrases
of
royal
and
papal
letters
and
behind
the
more
instructions
to
the
envoys
was
the
inescapable
fact
that
would
have
to
desert
his
allies
and
leave
them
to
the
vengeance
of
their
indignant
suzerain
the
king
of
in
return
for
being
given
an
equally
free
hand
with
the
insubordinate
was
a
doubly
bitter
blow
to
the
king
the
eyes
of
those
who
still
cared
for
such
things
it
was
a
reflection
on
his
honor
and
it
gave
further
grounds
for
complaint
to
his
overtaxed
subjects

were

out
well
for

either
he
liked

wrong
people
in
the
town
wanted
to
invest
in
my
hotel
and
advance
enough
money
to
build
a
larger
place
was
a
very
tempting
offer
father
would
have
done
it
if
it
been
for
my
mother
who
had
a
fear
of
being
in
debt
to
anyone
even
spite
of
his
being
well
liked
there
were
a
few
people
who
were
very
careful
about

my
opinion
of
him
that
he
was
too
sharp
or
a
little
too
good
to
be
true
of
the
people
who
was
afraid
of

his
own
brother
know
how
and
know
why
but
the
two
stores
the
one
in
and
the
one
in
that
had
been
set
up
as
a
partnership
were
dissolved
separated
from
each
other
was
all
very
friendly
except
when
it
came
to
the
youngest
brother
who
was
a
good
deal
older
than
had
treated
him
like
a
son
and
when
decided
to
stay
in
business
with
instead
of
going
with
looked
on
the
decision
as
a
betrayal
that
day
on
he
never
spoke
to
or
to
or
to
two
boys
and
six
miles
between
the
towns
became
an
ocean
and
the
became
a
family
of
strangers
went
on
and
everybody
got
older
became
fifteen
sixteen
then
twenty
and
still
sat
on
the
porch
with
a
rose
in
her
hair
and
got
richer
and
sicker
with
diabetes
was
in
the
spring
of
the
year
when
he
took
to
his
bed
and
and
found
out
that
they
know
each
other
were
like
two
strangers
store
was
their
marriage
and
when
had
to
leave
it
there
was
nothing
to
hold
them
together
everybody
thought
was
a
strong
woman
but
she
was
only
strong
because
she
had
to
lean
on
when
was
forced
into
his
bed
left
the
front
porch
of
the
store
and
sat
at
home
rocking
in
her
rocker
in
the
living
room
staring
out
the
window
the
rose
still
in
her
hair
could
do
nothing
for
cook
or
clean
or
make
him
comfortable
she
waited
for
to
get
better
and
take
care
of
her
was
life
and
in
his
sickroom
was
death
knew
that
too
remember
him
pointing
out
of
the
window
and
saying
that
he
wished
he
could
live
to
see
another
spring
but
that
he
began
to
put
his
affairs
in
order
and
he
went
about
it
like
a
man
putting
his
things
into
storage
father
who
liked
very
much
was
a
constant
visitor
day
told
him
that
he
had
decided
to
leave
everything
to
me
father
a
wise
man
asked
him
not
to
knew
liked
me
if
he
wanted
to
leave
me
something
let
it
be
a
trinket
nothing
else
leaving
me
everything
he
be
doing
me
a
favor
my
father
told
him
and
he
want
to
see
his
daughter
involved
in
a
lawsuit
want
to
leave
me
trouble
because
all
it
would
be
and
understood
was
getting
too
sick
to
stay
in
his
own
home
doctor
wanted
him
in
a
hospital
the
nearest
one
was
forty
miles
away
in
day
left
his
home
and
he
gave
up
the
convictions
of
a
lifetime
sent
me
for
the
whom
he
wanted
not
as
a
friend
but
as
a
rabbi
knew
why
had
come
for
him
he
walked
me
back
to
house
without
a
word
passing
between
us
entered
the
house
in
silence
walked
into
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
sat
down
to
wait
and
watched
who
moved
or
said
a
word
but
kept
staring
out
of
the
window
a
few
minutes
there
was
nothing
to
hear
voice
quiet
calm
strong
started
the
the
prayer
for
the
dead
could
hear
voice
a
few
words
behind
like
a
counterpoint
punctuated
by
sobs
of
sorrow
and
resignation
was
a
finality
in
the
rhythm
of
the
prayer
it
was
the
end
of
a
life
the
end
of
hope
and
the
wondering
if
there
would
ever
be
another
beginning
stayed
with
and
when
the
door
opened
they
both
came
out
was
dressed
for
his
trip
to
the
hospital
car
was
waiting
for
him
leaning
on
stopped
for
a
minute
to
look
at
turn
away
from
the
window
nodded
a
little
nod
and
went
out
through
the
door
his
brother
was
waiting
for
him
he
had
come
to
say
walked
past
him
without
a
word
and
got
into
the
car
ran
to
the
side
of
the
car
where
was
sitting
and
looked
at
him
begging
him
to
speak
looked
straight
ahead
car
began
to
move
and
ran
after
it
crying
to
me
the
car
moved
off
and
just
looked
straight
ahead
followed
the
car
until
it
reached
the
main
road
and
turned
towards
stood
there
watching
until
it
had
gone
from
his
sight
went
to
visit
in
the
a
few
times
first
time
went
there
he
asked
me
to
bring
him
water
from
well
water
that
reminded
him
of
his
first
days
in
the
mountains
and
before
came
the
next
time
filled
a
jug
for
him
and
brought
it
to
the
hospital
think
he
ever
got
to
drink
any
of
it
jug
stayed
at
the
hospital
and
the
water
what
can
happen
to
water
it
evaporated
disappeared
and
came
back
to
the
earth
as
rain
maybe
for
another
well
or
another
stream
or
another
where
is
it
written
was
always
called
the
until
he
left
town
and
the
shop
passed
over
to
the
who
then
became
automatically
the
was
a
boarder
with
the
family
came
to
directly
from
the
boat
that
brought
him
to
from
was
a
learned
man
and
a
very
gentle
soul
was
filled
with
knowledge
of
the
and
the
knew
the
whyfores
and
the
wherefores
but
he
was
weak
very
weak
on
the
therefores
the
took
the
as
an
apprentice
and
he
made
it
very
clear
that
a
man
of
learning
must
be
able
to
do
more
than
just
quote
the
of
the
in
order
to
live
learned
a
new
trade
from
who
supplied
the
town
and
the
hotels
with
meat
had
a
family
a
wife
a
daughter
and
a
son
daughter
was
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
and
always
had
hopes
that
someday
she
and
would
find
each
other
lived
in
the
same
house
and
it
seem
to
be
such
a
hard
thing
to
do
but
the
sad
realities
of
life
and
the
fact
that
love
her
never
satisfied
my
wishful
thinking
the
was
a
hard
master
and
a
hard
father
a
man
who
seem
to
know
the
difference
between
the
living
flesh
of
his
family
and
the
hanging
carcasses
of
his
stock
in
trade
treated
both
with
equal
indifference
and
with
equal
contempt
perhaps
he
was
a
little
more
sympathetic
to
the
sides
of
beef
that
hung
silently
from
his
hooks
and
became
friends
was
the
opposite
of
everything
she
should
have
been
a
positive
pole
in
a
negative
home
a
living
reaction
of
warmth
and
kindness
to
the
harsh
reality
of
her
father
whole
family
seemed
to
be
an
apology
for
brother
was
a
very
gentle
soul
her
mother
was
a
quiet
woman
who
said
little
but
who
had
hard
probing
eyes
every
rude
word
of
the
family
had
five
in
apology
chance
got
left
the
hotel
to
visit
was
free
but
she
was
bound
to
her
duties
that
not
even
the
coming
of
lightened
had
to
clean
the
glass
on
the
display
cases
in
the
butcher
shop
help
her
brother
scrub
the
cutting
tables
with
wire
brushes
mop
the
floors
put
down
new
sawdust
on
the
floors
and
help
check
the
outgoing
orders
these
chores
were
finished
only
then
was
she
allowed
whatever
freedom
she
could
find
helped
in
the
store
me
it
was
a
game
to
her
it
was
the
deadly
seriousness
of
life
wanted
to
help
so
that
we
could
find
time
to
play
allowed
me
to
help
so
that
she
could
have
her
few
little
hours
of
escape
the
work
was
finished
we
would
walk
road
past
the
butcher
shop
took
us
along
the
side
of
a
stream
ran
north
away
from
the
town
and
the
people
through
woods
and
past
the
nothingness
of
a
graveyard
preferred
the
loneliness
of
that
walk
would
have
liked
the
town
and
the
busyness
of
its
people
but
always
followed
into
the
peace
of
the
silent
and
unstaring
road
hard
to
understand
me
was
a
fine
and
lovely
girl
people
who
know
her
she
was
a
gawky
badly
dressed
kid
whose
arms
were
too
long
whose
legs
were
a
little
too
bony
had
the
hips
of
a
boy
and
a
walk
that
reminded
me
of
a
string
of
beads
strolling
down
the
street
she
had
the
kind
of
crossed
eyes
that
shocked
was
unexpected
unexpected
because
walked
with
her
head
bent
down
down
and
her
mark
of
friendship
was
to
look
into
your
face
accepted
her
crossed
eyes
as
she
accepted
my
childishness
childishness
compared
to
her
understanding
that
life
was
a
punishment
for
as
yet
undisclosed
sins
were
almost
the
same
age
she
was
fifteen
was
twelve
and
where
felt
there
was
a
life
to
look
forward
to
felt
she
had
had
as
much
of
it
as
was
necessary
we
went
for
our
walks
brother
would
come
along
every
once
in
a
while
was
an
almost
exact
copy
of
his
father
physically
and
it
was
strange
to
see
the
expected
become
the
unexpected
huge
hulk
played
the
guitar
and
he
would
take
it
along
on
our
walks
and

when

the

part

even
hearing

in
a
concert

surrounded

to
be
a
sort
of

a

very
flattered
to
be
included
in
the
protection
of

even
though

nothing
to
be

from
turn
of
the

or
to
be
more
precise
the
two
decades
preceeding
and
following
it
marks
a
great
change
in
the
history
of
early
scholarship
the
bottom
of
this
change
were
great
strides
forward
in
the
technical
equipment
and
technical
standards
of
the
historian
archaeology
for
example
the
contributions
of
and
to
the
various
volumes
of

the
discipline
from
the
status
of

antiquarian

of

most
valuable
single
tool

early

of

presented
with
an
organized
synthesis
of
the

also
true
of

the
reconstruction
of
early
history

long
been
recognized
in
fact
had
been
extensively
utilized
for
this
purpose
from
the
time
of
onwards
a
precise
knowledge
of
philology
however
it
is
debatable
whether
their
use
was
not
more
often
a
source
of
confusion
and
error
than
anything
else
in
the
nineteenth
century
such
accomplished
philologists
as
and
were
led
into
what
now
seem
ludicrous
errors
because
of
their
failure
to
recognize
that
modern
forms
of
place
names
are
not
necessarily
the
result
of
logical
philological
development
was
therefore
not
until
the
publication
of
and
that
a
scientific
basis
for
studies
was
established
is
another
area
for
which
the
dawn
of
the
twentieth
century
marks
the
beginning
of
modern
standards
of
scholarship
because
of
the
important
achievements
of
nineteenth
century
scholars
in
the
field
of
textual
criticism
the
advance
is
not
so
striking
as
it
was
in
the
case
of
archaeology
and
the
editorial
principles
laid
down
by
in
his
great
edition
of
and
in
his
were
a
distinct
improvement
upon
those
of
his
predecessors
and
remain
unimproved
upon
today
sum
it
can
be
said
that
the
techniques
and
standards
of
present
day
have
their
origin
at
the
turn
of
the
century
it
is
this
particularly
the
establishment
of
archaeology
and
studies
on
a
scientific
basis
which
are
immediately
pertinent
to
the
inevitably
the
first
result
of
this
technological
revolution
was
a
reaction
against
the
methods
and
in
many
cases
the
conclusions
of
the
school
of

particularly
regarding
the
nature
of

of
note
that

with

seem
that
the

had
turned
full
circle
fact
modern
scholarly
opinion
in
the
main
has
not
retreated
all
the
way
back
to
the
destructive
scepticism
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
one
meets
with
occasional
extremists
like
or
very
recently
the
majority
of
scholars
have
taken
a
middle
position
between
the
extremes
of
scepticism
and
gullibility
now
admit
that

infallible

critical

of

nineteenth

shattered
most
of
this
picturesque
narrative
the
other
hand
the
consensus
of
opinion
is
that
used
with
caution
and
in
conjunction
with
other
types
of
evidence
the
native
sources
still
provide
a
valid
rough
outline
for
the
settlement
of
southern
once
said
it
is
no
longer
fashionable
to
declare
that
we
can
say
nothing
certain
about
origins
in
one
way
and
have
been
vindicated
conclusions
concerning
the
untrustworthiness
of
the
annals
the
confused
chronology
of
the
unreliability
of
the
early
positions
of
the
genealogies
and
the
mythological
elements
contained
in
are
now
mostly
accepted
in
another
way
modern
historians
still
labor
in
the
vineyard
of
the
school
it
is
their
catastrophic
concept
of
the
invasions
rather
than
gradualist
approach
which
dominates
the
field
the
rejection
of
the
traditional
accounts
on
many
points
of
detail
as
late
as
it
was
still
possible
to
postulate
a
massive
and
comparatively
sudden
beginning
in
influx
of
as
the
type
of
invasions
this
point
of
course
the
issue
has
become
complicated
by
a
development
unforeseen
by
and
however
much
they
were
in
disagreement
with
the
late
over
the
method
by
which
was
agreed
with
them
that
the
end
result
was
the
complete
extinction
of
the
previous
population
and
civilization
beginning
for
all
practical
purposes
with
scholars
have
had
to
reckon
with
a
theory
involving
institutional
and
agrarian
continuity
between
and
times
which
is
completely
at
odds
with
the
reigning
concept
of
the
invasions
formidable
foes
have
taken
the
field
notably
whose
was
written
expressly
for
this
purpose
and
whose
had
a
similar
aim
due
to
their
efforts
the
catastrophic
has
maintained
its
position
although
has
always
found
supporters
in
his
and
defended
in
part
the
thesis
while
at
the
present
time
and
seem
to
fall
into
the
survivalist
camp
is
nevertheless
a
minority
view
scholars
while
willing
to
accept
a
survival
revival
of
art
forms
and
a
considerable
proportion
of
the
population
reject
any
institutional
legacy
from
it
is
plain
that
the
clear
distinctions
of
the
nineteenth
century
are
no
longer
with
us
the
main
stream
of
historical
thinking
is
a
group
of
scholars
et
who
are
in
varying
degrees
sceptical
of
the
native
traditions
of
the
conquest
but
who
defend
the
catastrophic
type
of
invasion
suggested
by
them
in
effect
have
compromised
the
opposing
positions
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
other
side
are
the
survivalists
who
have
taken
a
tack
divergent
from
both
these
schools
of
nineteenth
century
thought
a
group
they
should
be
favorable
to
a
concept
of
gradual
infiltration
although
the
specialist
nature
of
much
of
their
work
and
tends
to
obscure
their
sympathies
who
do
have
occasion
to
deal
with
the
invasions
in
a
more
general
way
like
and
are
on
the
side
of
a
gradual
and
often
peaceful
penetration
into
in
fact
denies
that
there
were
any
invasions
at
all
other
than
a
minor
foray
in
omitting
for
a
moment
some
recent
developments
we
can
say
the
hypothesis
of
and
has
undergone
virtual
eclipse
in
this
century
is
no
longer
possible
to
say
that
a
sceptical
attitude
towards
the
received
accounts
of
the
invasions
almost
automatically
produces
a
shore
occupied
by
interpretation
is
more
or
less
sceptical
and
virtually
no
one
has
been
willing
to
accept
or
position
on
that
point
reason
is
of
course
that
the
new
scepticism
has
been
willing
to
maintain
the
general
picture
of
the
invasions
as
portrayed
in
the
traditional
sources
few
scholars
who
have
adopted
the
shore
occupied
by
interpretation
and
have
all
been
survivalists
they
have
done
so
in
rather
special
circumstances
primary
reason
for
the
abandonment
of
the
shore
occupied
by
thesis
has
been
the
assimilation
and
accumulation
of
archaeological
evidence
the
most
striking
feature
of
early
studies
in
this
century
omitting
recent
developments
dictum
of
has
stood
unchallenged
far
as
archaeology
is
concerned
there
is
not
the
least
warrant
for
the
second
shore
occupied
by
of
these
theories
earlier
had
come
to
the
same
conclusion
they
meant
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
south
and
east
coasts
of
received
settlers
conspicuously
earlier
than
some
other
parts
of
is
there
was
no
trace
of
in
as
early
as
the
late
third
century
to
which
time
the
archaeological
evidence
for
the
erection
of
the
forts
was
beginning
to
point
the
face
of
a
clear
judgment
from
archaeology
therefore
it
became
impossible
for
a
time
for
scholars
to
the
shore
settled
by
theory
recent
years
however
a
wind
of
change
seems
to
be
blowing
through
early
historical
circles
great
increase
in
the
amount
of
archaeological
activity
and
therefore
information
in
the
years
immediately
preceeding
and
following
the
has
brought
to
light
data
which
has
changed
the
complection
of
the
dispute
there
were
none
fifteen
years
ago
several
scholars
currently
are
edging
their
way
cautiously
towards
the
acceptance
of
the
shore
occupied
by
position
must
therefore
have
a
look
at
the
new
archaeological
material
and
the
literary
and
evidence
which
bears
upon
the
problem
exactly
are
we
trying
to
prove
know
that
the
was
a
phenonenon
of
late
defensive
policy
in
other
words
its
existence
belongs
to
the
period
of
whenever
the

withdrew
from
the
island
the
disappeared
in
the
first
decade
of
the
fifth
century
also
know
that
the
as
reflected
in
the
was
created
as
a
part
of
the
reorganization
of
post
argument
is
that
there
was
no
prior
to
that
time
even
though
the
forts
had
been
in
existence
since
the
time
of
what
we
must
prove
or
disprove
is
that
there
were
in
the
broad
sense
in
which
we
must
construe
the
word
in
the
area
of
the
at
the
time
it
was
called

we
must
find
in
and
in
the
last
half
of
the
fourth
century
problem
in
other
words
is
strictly
a
chronological
one
the
element
on
its
was
plainly
visible
because
there
the
were
an
intrusive
element
in
the
population
obviously
the
archaeological
and
characteristics
of
the
region
are
bound
to
be
is
a
matter
of
trying
to
sort
out
an
earlier
element
from
the
later
mainstream
of
invasions
naturally
will
be
difficult
to
do
since
both
the
archaeological
and
evidence
in
this
period
with
some
fortunate
exceptions
is
insufficient
for
precise
chronological
purposes
might
be
well
to
consider
the
literary
evidence
first
because
it
can
provide
us
with
an
answer
to
one
important
question
namely
is
the
idea
that
there
were
mercenaries
in
at
all
reasonable
do
so
something
was
necessary
beyond
volunteering
because
there
was
little
glamour
or
romance
in
the
war
it
meant
instead
hardship
dirt
and
death
gave
credit
for
the
initiation
of
the
draft
of
soldiers
from
the
idea
a
chain
reaction

the
proposal
to

it
on

as
the
volunteer
system

that
selective
service
would
not
only
prevent
the
disorganization
of
essential
war
industries
but
would
avoid
the
undesirable
moral
effects
of
the
reliance
on
enlistment

where
the
feeling
of
the
people
was
whipped
into
a
frenzy

necessary

its
very
life
was
at

a

in
which
he
can
perceive
no
visible
cause
and

he
should
be
alert
to
intuition

firmly
contended
that
the
historian
must
never
underrate
the
impact
of
the
geographical
environment
on
history
was
another
indispensable
tool
he
concluded
that
geographical
conditions
have
exercised
a
great
possibly
a
preponderating
influence
over
destiny
failure
of
to
reach
the
imperial
destiny
that
had
seemed
to
promise
was
almost
directly
attributable
to
her
physical
conformation
areas
of
history
were
either
favorably
or
adversely
affected
by
the
geographical
environment
and
no
respectable
historian
could
pursue
the
study
of
history
without
a
thorough
knowledge
of
geography
was
consistent
in
his
admonishments
to
historians
about
the
necessary
tools
or
insights
they
needed
to
possess
as
a
practicing
historian
he
himself
has
left
few
clues
to
the
amount
of
professional
scholarship
that
he
used
when
writing
history
fact
if
judgments
are
to
be
rendered
upon
the
soundness
of
his
historicism
they
must
be
based
on
scanty
evidence
evidence
is
available
would
seem
to
indicate
that
unlike
his
older
brother
had
most
of
the
methodological
vices
usually
found
in
the
amateur
credulousness
a
distaste
for
documentation
an
uncritical
reliance
on
contemporary
accounts
and
a
proneness
to
assume
a
theory
as
true
before
adequate
proof
was
provided
were
all
evidences
of
his
failure
to
comprehend
the
use
of
the
scientific
method
or
to
evaluate
the
responsibilities
of
the
historian
to
his
reading
public
is
not
to
assume
that
his
work
was
without
merit
but
the
validity
of
his
assumptions
concerning
the
meaning
of
history
must
always
be
considered
against
this
background
of
an
unprofessional
approach
credulity
is
perhaps
best
illustrated
in
his
introduction
to
which
purports
to
examine
the
trials
of
and
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
leader
of
the
exodus
from
and
the
leadership
of
the
clergy
in
colonial
criticism
has
been
leveled
at
this
rather
forced
analogy
but
what
is
equally
significant
is
complete
acceptance
of
the
record
as
good
and
trustworthy
history
light
of
the
scholarly
reappraisals
engendered
by
the
higher
criticism
this
is
a
most
remarkable
statement
particularly
coming
from
one
who
was
well
known
for
his
antifundamentalist
views
desire
to
substantiate
a
thesis
at
the
expense
of
sound
research
technique
smacks
more
of
the
propagandist
than
the
historian
similar
amateurish
characteristic
is
revealed
in
failure
to
check
the
accuracy
and
authenticity
of
his
informational
sources
he
found
data
that
fitted
his
general
plan
he
used
it
and
counted
his
sources
trustworthy
if
statistics
were
uncovered
which
contradicted
a
cherished
theory
the
sources
were
denounced
as
faulty
manipulations
are
frequently
encountered
in
his
essay
on
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
during
the
reformation
depended
largely
on
the
dispatches
of
foreign
ambassadors
and
observers
in
claiming
that
the
reports
of
such
agents
had
to
be
accurate
because
there
were
no
newspapers
is
certainly
an
irrational
dogmatism
in
which
the
modern
mind
attempts
to
understand
the
spirit
of
the
sixteenth
century
on
terms
he
rejects
the
contemporary
accounts
of
casually
adjudging
them
to
be
distorted
by
prejudice
because
the
opinions
of
are
of
no
great
value
is
exposited
by
this
observation
is
not
the
inherent
prejudices
of
but
the
of
all
fairness
it
must
be
admitted
that
made
no
pretense
at
being
an
impartial
historian
to
him
meant
an
unwillingness
to
generalize
and
to
search
for
a
synthesis
deplored
the
impact
of
historiography
on
the
writing
of
history
terming
it
a
dismal
monster
and
his
disciples
had
reduced
history
to
a
profession
of
dullness
preferred
the
chronicles
of
or
the
style
and
theorizing
of
for
at
least
they
took
a
stand
on
the
issues
about
which
they
wrote
wrote
eloquently
to
that
impartial
history
was
not
only
impossible
but
undesirable
the
historian
was
convinced
of
his
own
correctness
then
he
should
not
allow
his
vision
to
become
fogged
by
disturbing
facts
was
history
that
must
be
in
error
not
the
historian
was
this
basic
trait
that
separated
from
the
ranks
of
professional
historians
and
led
him
to
commit
time
and
time
again
what
was
his
most
serious
offense
against
the
historical
method
namely
the
tendency
to
assume
the
truth
of
an
hypothesis
before
submitting
it
to
the
test
of
facts
of
work
reflects
this
dogmatic
characteristic
page
seems
to
be
complete
without
the
statement
of
at
least
one
unproved
generalization
example
of
this
was
his
assertion
that
all
servile
revolts
must
be
dealt
with
by
physical
force
is
no
explanation
of
terms
nor
a
qualification
that
most
such
revolts
have
been
dealt
with
by
force
only
a
bald
dogmatism
that
they
must
because
of
some
undefined
compulsion
be
so
repelled
matters
of
race
he
was
similarly
inflexible
of
the
modern
races
seem
to
have
inherited
the
rigidity
of
the
mind
cites
the

typifying
this
rigidity
but
makes
no
mention
of
the
who
have
been
able
to
adapt
to
all
types
of
circumstances
pontificates
that
one
of
the
first
signs
of
advancing
civilization
is
the
fall
in
the
value
of
women
in
eyes
made
no
difference
that
most
evidence
points
to
an
opposite
conclusion
had
made
up
his
mind
before
all
the
facts
were
available
critics
of
and
his
methods
have
observed
this
particular
deficiency
was
appalled
by
such
spurious
history
as
that
which
attributed
the
fall
of
the
empire
to
the
woolen
trade
and
he
urged
to
transform
his
essay
into
a
real
history
embodying
not
merely
those
facts
which
fit
into
his
theory
but
also
the
modifications
and
exceptions
called
the
method
literally
antihistorical
while
maintained
that
the
assumptions
were
not
confined
to
theories
alone
but
were
also
applicable
to
straight
factual
evidence
stated
always
omits
facts
which
tend
to
disprove
his
hypothesis
who
compared
to
the
lifting
of
a
fog
from
ancient
landscapes
was
also
forced
to
admit
the
methodological
deficiencies
of
the
author
summary
felt
that
the
nature
of
history
was
order
and
that
the
order
so
discovered
was
as
much
subject
to
historical
laws
as
the
forces
of
nature
he
believed
that
most
professional
historians
lacked
some
of
the
essential
instruments
for
a
proper
study
of
history
despite
the
insight
of
many
of
his
observations
his
own
conclusions
are
open
to
suspicion
because
of
his
failure
to
employ
at
all
times
the
correct
research
methods
should
not
prejudice
an
evaluation
of
his
findings
but
they
were
not
the
findings
of
a
completely
impartial
investigator
was
perhaps
more
important
than
his
concept
of
the
nature
of
history
and
the
historical
method
were
those
forces
which
shaped
the
direction
of
his
thought
the
final
analysis
his
contribution
to
historiography
was
founded
on
almost
intuitive
insights
into
religion
economics
and
the
three
factors
which
conditioned
his
search
for
a
law
of
history
without
supernaturalism
considered
religion
as
an
extremely
significant
manifestation
of
fear
of
the
unknown
it
was
nothing
more
than
that
and
the

institutions
which
had
been
created
by

need
not
be
concerned
with
the
philosophical
problems
suggested
by
religion
was
no
evidence
either
of
a
positive
or
negative
type
of
the
actions
of
a
in
this
world
and
since
the
historian
should
only
be
interested
in
strictly
terrestrial
activity
his
research
should
eliminate
the
supernatural
he
must
regard
religion
as
the
expression
of
human
forces
he
must
recognize
its
power
and
attempt
to
ascertain
its
influence
on
the
flow
of
history
but
he
must
not
confuse
the
natural
and
the
mundane
with
the
divine
was
not
breaking
new
ground
when
he
claimed
that
the
worship
of
an
unseen
power
was
in
reality
a
reflection
of
inability
to
cope
with
his
environment
of
anthropology
and
comparative
religion
had
long
been
aware
that
there
was
indeed
a
direct
connection
was
one
of
the
first
to
suggest
that
this
human
incompetence
was
the
only
motivating
factor
behind
religion
was
this
fear
which
explained
the
development
of
a
priestly
caste
whose
function
in
society
was
to
mollify
and
appease
the
angry
deities
keep
themselves
entrenched
in
power
the
priests
were
forced
to
demonstrate
their
unique
status
through
the
miracle
was
the
use
of
the
supernatural
that
kept
them
in
business
barbarians
of
the
fourth
century
offered
an
excellent
example
in
the
fourth
century
were
a
very
simple
race
who
comprehended
little
of
natural
laws
and
who
therefore
referred
phenomena
they
did
not
understand
to
supernatural
intervention
intervention
could
only
be
controlled
by
priests
and
thus
the
invasions
caused
a
rapid
rise
in
the
influence
of
the
sacred
class
power
of
every
ecclesiastical
organization
has
always
rested
on
the
miracle
and
the
clergy
have
always
proved
their
divine
commission
as
did
contended
that
once
such
a
special
class
had
been
created
it
became
a
vested
interest
and
sought
to
maintain
itself
by
assuming
exclusive
control
over
the
relationships
between
and
man
the
was
born
and
because
of
its
intrinsic
character
was
soon
identified
as
a
conservative
institution
determined
to
resist
the
forces
of
change
to
identify
itself
with
the
political
rulers
and
to
maintain
a
kind
of
splendid
isolation
from
the
masses
was
not
only
mysterious
it
was
also
sacred
and
no
believer
in
an
inspired
church
could
tolerate
having
her
canons
examined
as
we
should
examine
human
laws
basic
ideas
concerning
the
nature
of
religion
were
believed
some
of
the
major
keys
to
the
understanding
of
history
and
the
movement
of
society
dark
views
about

found
in
were
never
altered

adherence
to
the
status
quo
the
forces
of
organized
religion
were
compelled
to
make
adjustments
as
increasing
civilization
augmented
human
knowledge
traced
this
evolution
always
pointing
to
the
fact
that
although
the
forms
became
more
rational
the
substance
remained
unchanged
relic
worship
and
monasticism
of
the
were
more
advanced
forms
than
were
primitive
fetish
worship
and
nature
myths
the
idea
imbedded
in
each
was
identical
to
surround
the
unknown
with
mystery
and
to
isolate
that
class
which
had
been
given
special
dominion
over
the
secrets
of
that
age
in
which
religion
exercised
power
over
the
entire
culture
of
the
race
was
one
of
imagination
and
it
is
largely
the
admiration
he
so
obviously
held
for
such
eras
that
betrays
a
peculiar
religiosity
a
sentiment
he
would
have
probably
denied
had
written
his
classic
incidents
of
travel
about
these
regions
a
hundred
years
before
and
who
had
studied
in
and
the
great
ruins
of
and
had
drawn
the
splendid
illustrations
that
accompanied
the
text
an
architect
in
had
been
forgotten
like
and
reconstructed
their
lives
as
one

a
museum
a
dinosaur
from
two
or
three
petrified
bones
had
unearthed
letters
in
a
farmhouse
and
he
discovered
unmarked
grave
in
an
old
cemetery
on
the
east
side
of
where
the
great
traveller
had
been
hastily
buried
during
a
cholera
epidemic
had
been
stirred
by
my
account
of
him
in
for
was
one
of
the
lost
writers
whom
had
seen
in
his
childhood
and
whom
was
bent
on
resurrecting
had
led
an
adventurous
life
metier
was
the
tropics
and
he
had
lived
all
over
and
among
the
primitive
tribes
on
the
river
he
knew
the
sleepless
nights
the
howling
dogs
and
the
biting
insects
in
the
villages
of
the
and
had
not
yet
undertaken
the
great
exploit
of
his
later
years
the
rediscovery
of
the
ancient
highway
the
route
of
in
but
he
had
climbed
to
the
original
the
lake
of
and
he
had
scaled
the
southern
with
its
people
and
looked
into
the
emerald
mines
of
a
naturalist
living
for
two
years
at
the
headwaters
of
the
he
had
collected
specimens
for
museums
and
he
had
taken
to
the
zoo
a
live
quetzal
the
sacred
bird
of
the
old
fact
he
had
raised
quetzal
birds
in
his
camp
in
the
forest
of
he
had
spent
six
months
on
the
islands
among
the
great
turtles
that
had
found
there
and
now
and
then
he
would
disappear
into
some
small
island
of
the
book
on
was
largely
written
in
my
study
in
the
house
at
had
had
my
name
taken
out
of
the
telephone
book
and
this
was
partly
because
of
a
convict
who
had
been
discharged
from
and
who
called
me
night
after
night
said
he
was
a
friend
of
who
had
run
a
free
employment
bureau
for
several
months
during
the
depression
but
the
generous
to
whom
wrote
did
not
know
his
name
and
somehow
conceived
the
morbid
notion
that
the
man
in
question
was
prowling
round
the
house
one
day
came
the
voice
of
a
man
had
known
when
he
was
a
boy
and
later
remembered
that
this
boy
thirty
years
before
had
struck
me
as
coming
to
no
good
had
been
something
sinister
about
him
that
warned
me
against
him
had
never
felt
that
way
about
any
other
boy
but
when
he
uttered
his
name
on
the
telephone
had
forgotten
this
and
was
glad
to
do
what
he
asked
of
me
was
a
captain
he
said
in
the
army
and
on
the
train
to
his
purse
and
all
his
money
had
been
stolen
and
would
lend
him
dollars
to
be
given
him
at
the
window
hearing
from
him
again
remembered
the
little
boy
of
whom
had
had
such
doubts
when
he
was
ten
years
old
lived
for
a
while
in
a
movie
melodrama
with
a
cook
and
her
son
who
turned
out
to
be
we
got
them
out
of
the
house
after
the
boy
had
run
away
four
times
looking
for
other
threatening
to
murder
village
schoolchildren
and
bragging
that
he
was
to
be
the
next
he
began
to
have
epileptic
fits
found
that
a
charitable
society
in
had
a
long
of
the
two
and
they
agreed
to
see
that
the
tragic
pair
would
not
put
poison
in
anybody
soup
the
house
came
once
the
president
of
who
had
been
one
of
my
old
professors
and
who
still
called
me
when
was
sixty
reminded
me
of
my
other
professor
of
whom
had
been
so
fond
when
was
at
the
great
mediaevalist
and
classical
scholar
who
had
asked
me
to
call
him
saying
counts
for
nothing
among
those
who
have
learned
to
know
life
sub
specie
aeternitatis
had
always
thought
of
that
lovable
man
as
many
years
older
than
myself
although
he
was
perhaps
only
twenty
years
older
and
he
confirmed
my
feeling
along
with
the
feeling
of
both
my
sons
that
teachers
of
the
classics
are
invariably
endearing
must
have
written
to
say
how
much
had
enjoyed
his
fine
book
and
found
he
had
not
regretted
giving
me
the
highest
mark
in
his
old
course
on
the
later
poets
although
in
my
final
examination
had
ignored
the
questions
and
filled
the
bluebook
with
a
comparison
of
and
had
written
to
me
about
a
dinner
he
had
had
with
the
monks
at
in

been
reading
at
table
especially
from
two
books
account
of
in
his
and
my
own
said
have
criticized
your
book
as
being
neither
literary
criticism
nor
history
course
it
was
not
meant
to
be
have
felt
that
comes
out
rather
slimly
but
let
them
look
at
the
title
of
the
book
felt
as
felt
about
this
best
of
all
my
books
that
it
was
really
tops
or
three
times
came
to
lunch
with
us
in
that
wonderful
man
who
lived
to
be
more
than
a
hundred
years
old
and
whose
birthplace
had
been
my
suburb
reading
ranged
from
to
and
he
had
an
insatiable
interest
in
his
while
his
letters
were
full
of
gossip
about
new
politicians
and
old
men
of
letters
with
whom
he
had
been
intimately
thrown
six
decades
before
could
never
forget
the
gaiety
with
which
when
he
was
both
blind
and
deaf
he
let
me
lead
him
around
his
rooms
to
look
at
some
of
the
pictures
and
once
when
he
came
to
see
us
in
he
walked
away
in
a
rainstorm
unwilling
to
hear
of
a
taxi
or
even
an
umbrella
although
he
was
at
the
time
ninety
years
old
were
several
men
of
ninety
or
more
whom
knew
first
or
last
all
of
whom
were
still
productive
and
most
of
whom
knew
one
another
as
if
they
had
naturally
come
together
at
the
apex
of
their
lives
never
met
whose
style
was
a
sort
of
verbal
fog
and
who
had
written
asking
me
to
go
to
with
him
when
he
was
investigating
the
cause
of
but
liked
to
think
of
him
at
ninety
swimming
and
working
at
long
after
had
moved
to
house
had
dined
with
the
nonogenarian
rationalist
and
the
charming
scholar
who
had
a
great
popular
success
with
there

and
there
was
an
accomplished
man
of
letters
who
wrote
in
the
spirit
of
and
produced
in
the
end
a
formidable
body
of
work
saw
often
before
his
death
at
he
had
remarried
at
the
age
of
ninety
and
he
asked
me
when
once
returned
from
if
knew
the
in
the
church
of
in
had
to
confess
that
had
missed
these
frescoes
recently
discovered
that
he
had
studied
in
his
eighties
had
chosen
to
follow
the
philosophy
of
whom
with
his
followers
put
in
hell
but
he
defended
the
doctrine
in
and
what
indeed
could
be
said
against
the
virtues
health
frugality
privacy
culture
and
friendship
the
philosopher
said
the
first
visitors
to
should
be
persons
likely
to
make
a
good
impression
and
when
he
was
asked
would
you
send
replied
first
choice
would
be
friend
of
many
years
came
once
to
visit
us
in
the
house
at
spoke
at
the
ninetieth
birthday
party
of
who
embarked
on
a
fictional
trilogy
at
and
who
with
had
created
a
intelligentsia
that
had
never
existed
in
before
him
their
interpreter
and
guide
he
had
broken
with
and
become
a
spokesman
of
the
coloured
people
of
the
world
wrote
to
me
once
about
an
old
friend
of
mine
whom
had
first
met
in
in
and
who
also
came
out
for
a
in
you
ever
know
a
man
with
greater
zest
for
information
his
memory
like
an
stored
with
precise
knowledge
of
men
and
things
and
happenings
wife
as
gay
as
a
lark
and
as
lively
as
a
gazelle
she
was
then
had
a
sense
of
humour
that
has
been
denied
but
neither
has
any
aesthetic
perceptions
and
books
are
enough
for
them
was
visiting
and
not
waiting
for
breakfast
he
was
off
to
the
where
he
spent
hours
writing
obituaries
of
living
for
or
rising
ninety
he
was
beset
by
publishers
for
the
story
of
his
life
and
miracles
as
he
put
it
but
calling
himself
the
he
had
spent
his
time
writing
short
articles
and
long
letters
and
could
not
get
even
a
small
popular
book
done
all
but
blind
he
said
there
was
nothing
in
to
ought
to
have
known
that
and
look
at
my
bookshelves
despairingly
knowing
that
can
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
at
he
had
still
been
busy
writing
articles
reviewing
and
speaking
and
had
never
before
known
an
who
had
visited
and
lectured
in
three
quarters
of
the
colleges
and
clubs
took
the
line
that
speakers
from
were
not
wanted
any
longer
even
speakers
like
so
unlike
the
novelists
and
poets
who
had
patronized
the
for
many
years
their
facile
generalizations
about
the
these
mediocrities
as
they
often
were
had
been
great
successes
did
not
like
liked
his
poems
very
much
but
made
the
mistake
of
telling
so
whereupon
he
said
to
me
suppose
you
think
you
know
all
about
me
should
have
replied
probably
know
something
about
the
best
part
of
you
only
thought
of
that
in
the
middle
of
the
night
years
later
went
to
see
in
where
he
was
living
at
near
and
he
showed
me
beside
his
cottage
there
the
remains
of
the
road
on
which
is
supposed
to
have
travelled
was
convinced
that
was
nearly
all
wrong
as
it
applied
to
which
was
driving
forward
into
uncharted
waters
with
the
danger
of
a
new
tyranny
ahead
however
we
go
whatever
our
doom
it
will
not
take
the
shape
facts
mainly
in
his
mind
he
was
often
acute
in
the
matter
of
style
and
he
said
young
who
have
as
yet
nothing
to
say
will
try
larks
with
initial
letters
and
broken
lines
put
them
before
a
situation
which
they
are
forced
to
depict
he
was
speaking
of
the
civil
war
and
they
have
no
hesitation
they
merely
do
their
best
to
make
it
real
for
others
looked
at
her
as
she
spoke
then
got
up
as
she
was
speaking
still
and
simply
and
wordlessly
walked
out
that
was
the
end
nearly
went
to
the
and
telegraphed
he
meet
him
in
in
on
the
train
leaving
at
nine
next
morning
would
go
to
together
where
parties
would
be
piled
on
weariness
and
on
misery
not
for
long
and
had
written
him
enthusiastic
praise
of
any
changes
could
be
made
in
proof
which
was
already
coming
from
the
printer
and
they
had
ordered
copies
the
largest
first
printing
of
any
book
in
history
none
of
this
could
soothe
the
exacerbated
nerves
drove
him
up
the
to
a
establishment
for
the
speedy
if
temporary
rehabilitation
of
drunkards
who
could
no
longer
help
themselves
in
departing
begged
that
there
be
no
liquor
in
the
apartment
at
the
on
his
return
and
he
took
with
him
the
first
thirty
galleys
of
with
the
boys
back
at
school
and
college
wrote
to
say
that
she
was
through
quite
through
whole
venture
was
my
last
gesture
and
it
has
failed
as
well
as
mentally
have
reached
the
limit
of
my
endurance
last
gift
to
him
is
complete
silence
until
the
book
is
out
and
the
first
heated
discussion
dies
down
him
to
divorce
and
wife
simultaneously
would
be
bad
publicity
am
really
ill
at
the
present
moment
and
will
go
to
some
sort
of
a
sanitarium
to
normalize
myself
she
withdrew
then
to
in
replied
do
really
hope
you
can
achieve
serenity
in
the
course
of
time
course
hope
can
also
but
those
hopes
are
much
more
faint
on
he
returned
to
the
in
high
spirits
and
looking
fit
had
been
he
wrote
at
once
in
the
country
a
euphemism
for
an
experience
that
had
not
greatly
changed
him
remembers
that
before
unpacking
his
bag
he
telephoned
his
bootlegger
with
a
generous
order
and
almost
at
once
the
familiar
procession
of
people
began
milling
through
our
living
room
at
any
hour
between
two
and
three
were
strays
of
every
kind
university
students
and
journalists
and
barflies
taxi
drivers
and
editors
and
unknown
poets
as
well
as
friends
like
and
the
and
and
and
the
he
came
home
from
his
office
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
never
knew
what
gathering
he
should
expect
to
find
but
there
almost
always
was
one
did
not
neglect
his
wife
in
but
telephoned
her
and
wrote
her
with
assurances
of
his
continuing
interest
and
of
his
wish
to
stand
behind
her
in
their
separation
and
of
his
hope
that
there
would
be
no
bitterness
between
them
was
occupying
herself
in
an
attempt
to
write
an
article
about
the
variety
of
houses
that
they
had
rented
abroad
was
of
unsettled
mind
as
to
whether
he
should
go
abroad
when
the
galleys
were
finished
a
time
urging
to
give
up
his
public
relations
work
and
take
up
writing
instead

with
the

on
the

of
that
long

making
considerable

and
the
combination
of
hard

and
hard
frivolity
exhausted
him
once
more

that
he
was

to
spend
three
days
in

all

then
he
took
him
to

they
were
to

gave
a
party
but
he
was
too
indisposed
to
appear
at
it
took
occasion
to
warn
about
drinking
and
urged
him
to
try
to
keep
him
sober
a
dinner
party
for
which
she
had
come
down
to
and
arrived
to
see
them
off
and
made
tart
observations
that
indicated
that
had
been
less
discreet
than
he
had
promised
to
be
about
the
real
nature
of
their
separation
was
still
solicitous
of
his
condition
let
him
do
as
he
wished
let
him
sleep
with
chambermaids
if
he
must
but
she
begged
try
to
keep
him
from
drinking
a
great
deal
and
bring
him
back
in
good
health
they
stood
at
the
rail
waving
down
to
his
wife
and
below
said
there
is
future

when
questioned
by
reporters
about
the
separation
she
said
adore
him
and
he
adores
me
had
brought
news
from
his
departure
a
group
of
his
friends
the
among
them
had
given
him
a
luncheon
and
had
seen
advance
sheets
of
was
outraged
by
the

and
announced
that
he
had
discovered
fifty
technical
errors
in
its
account
of
church
practices
challenged
him
to
name
one
and
he
was
silent
his
rancor
did
not
cease
and
presently
on
when
he
preached
a
sermon
on
the
text
he
told
his
congregation
how
disappointed
he
was
in
how
he
regretted
having
had
him
in
his
house
and
how
he
should
have
been
warned
by
the
fact
that
the
novelist
was
drunk
all
the
time
that
he
was
working
on
the
book
that
sermon
like
those
of
hundreds
of
other
ministers
was
yet
to
be
delivered
took
the
usual
suite
in
the
newspapers
he
talked
about
his
unquiet
life
about
his
wish
to
be
a
newspaperman
once
more
about
the
prevalence
of
slang
in
speech
about
the
loquacity
of
the
and
the
impossibility
of
finding
quiet
in
a
railway
carriage
about
his
plans
to
wander
for
two
years
unless
stopped
and
made
to
write
another
book
wondered
how
anyone
in
a
railway
carriage
would
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
since
it
was
well
known
that
always
did
all
of
the
talking
friends
it
said
had
gone
into
training
to
keep
up
with
him
vocally
and
with
his
allegro
movements
around
the
luncheon
table
editorialist
wondered
just
who
would
stop
and
make
him
write
a
book
remarks
about
his
marriage
were
suggestive
enough
to
induce
reporters
to
invade
the
offices
of
for
information
to
pursue
to
and
after
she
had
returned
to
to
ferret
her
out
at
the
on
upper
where
she
had
taken
an
apartment
to
the
she
emphatically
denied
the
divorce
rumors
and
explained
that
she
had
stayed
behind
because
of
the
schooling
of
their
son
which
henceforth
would
be
strictly
rumors
of
permanent
separation
started
up
a
whole
crop
of
stories
about
her
had
it
that
a
friend
protesting
her
snobbery
said
you
are
an
you
she
replied
was
born
in
but
was
conceived
in
himself
furthered
these
tales
is
said
to
have
reported
that
once
when
she
went
to
a
hospital
to
call
on
a
friend
after
a
serious
operation
and
the
friend
protested
that
it
had
been
nothing
she
replied
it
was
your
healthy
peasant
blood
that
pulled
you
through
these
and
similar
tales
he
was
entertaining
his
friends
all
of
whom
he
was
seeing
when
he
was
not
showing
the
sights
of
and
its
environs
once
upon
his
arrival
he
telephoned
who
invited
them
to
tea
and
then
decided
to
give
a
party
as
a
quick
way
of
rounding
up
his
friends
invited
and
a
half
dozen
others
was
a
dinner
party
had
been
drinking
during
the
afternoon
and
long
before
the
party
really
got
under
way
he
was
quite
drunk
with
the
result
that
the
party
broke
up
even
before
dinner
was
over
at
the
head
of
the
table
would
leap
up
and
move
around
behind
the
chairs
of
his
guests
making
remarks
that
when
not
highly
offensive
were
at
least
highly
inappropriate
and
then
presently
he
collapsed
and
was
put
to
bed
emerged
from
the
bedroom
everyone
was
gone
except
the
tolerant
who
stayed
and
chatted
with
him
for
half
an
hour
and
then
lay
awake
most
of
that
night
despairing
of
what
he
must
expect
on
the
at
dawn
he
fell
asleep
and
when
he
awoke
and
came
into
the
living
room
he
found
in
his
pajamas
before
the
fire
smoking
a
cigarette
said
that
he
wanted
to
apologize
for
not
having
prevented
from
making
that
horrible
spectacle
of
himself
that
he
should
have
seized
him
by
the
neck
at
once
and
forcibly
hauled
him
into
his
bedroom
warned
him
never
to
lay
a
hand
on
him
and
then
asked
for
his
fare
back
to
the
looked
at
him
and
began
to
cry
and
then
saying
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
promise
he
asked
to
call
the
porter
and
to
tell
him
to
take
out
all
the
liquor
that
he
did
not
want
from
now
on
for
the
rest
of
this
trip
will
only
drink
what
you
agree
that
should
drink
called
the
porter
and
had
him
remove
everything
but
one
bottle
of
brandy
and
after
that
they
would
have
a
cocktail
or
two
before
dinner
or
on
one
of
their
walking
trips
beer
or
in
and
wine
in
moderation
gave
him
a
guidebook
tour
of
and
motoring
and
walking
took
him
to
but
the
stay
was
for
only
ten
days
and
on
the
twentieth
they
took
the
train
for
where
they
spent
the
night
for
an
early
morning
crossing
in
a
considerable
establishment
lived
a
pulp
writer
and
his
brother
both
friends
of
suggested
that
they
call
on
these
brothers
who
received
them
pleasantly
they
returned
to
their
hotel
and
got
ready
for
bed
was
late
and
was
ready
to
go
to
sleep
but
was
not
said
had
a
good
time
tonight
we
agreed
and
said
that
it
would
have
been
very
different
if
his
wife
had
been
with
him
he
kept
awake
for
more
than
an
hour
while
he
did
an
imaginary
dialogue
between
his
wife
and
himself
in
which
discussing
the
evening
he
was
continually
berated
began
the
dialogue
by
having
his
wife
announce
that
one
does
not
invade
homes
without
warning
them
that
one
is
coming
and
went
on
from
that
with
the
entire
catalogue
of
his
social
gaucheries
on
if
the
lists
exist
they
contain
between
twenty
to
thirty
names
the
total
number
of
incepting
bachelors
in

according
to

n
two
hundred
the
names
listed
in
the

slightly
less
than
one
tenth

of

who
then
incepted

that
later
boasted
of
how
well
his
work
had
been
received
there
since
he
attained
a
rank
in
the
order
of
commencing
bachelors
higher
than
that
of
any
other
inceptor
from
of
that
year
is
not
possible
to
reconstruct
fully
the
arrangements
whereby
these
honors
lists
were
then
made
up
or
even
how
the
names
that
they
contained
assumed
the
order
in
which
we
find
them
process
usually
began
with
a
tutor
boasting
about
a
boy
as
had
boasted
about
to
the
higher
officers
of
the
college
and
university
the
various
officers
of
the
college
might
take
up
the
case
would
however
reach
the
proctors
and
other
officers
in
charge
of
the
performances
of
the
incepting
bachelors
and
the
place
that
any
individual
obtained
in
the
lists
depended
greatly
on
how
he
comported
himself
in
the
public
schools
during
his
acts
therein
as
he
was
incepting
course
the
higher
officials
could
add
or
place
a
name
on
the
list
wherever
they
wished
name
being
fourth
is
neither
too
high
nor
too
low
to
be
assigned
to
the
arbitrary
action
of
proctor
master
or
other
mighty
hand
evidently
earned
the
place
assigned
him
of
undergraduate
career
back
from
the
spring
of
over
the
four
years
of
undergraduate
days
certain
phases
of
his
college
career
stand
out
as
of
permanent
consequence
to
him
and
hence
to
us
course
the
principal
factor
in
the
whole
experience
was
the
kind
of
education
he
received
differed
from
what
an
undergraduate
receives
today
from
any
college
or
university
mainly
in
the
certainty
of
what
he
was
forced
to
learn
compared
with
the
loose
and
widely
scattered
information
obtained
today
by
most
of
our
undergraduates
was
required
to
absorb
and
display
an
intensive
and
accurate
knowledge
of
grammar
ethics
physics
or
natural
philosophy
metaphysics
and
and
had
also
sampled
various
special
fields
of
learning
being
unable
to
miss
some
study
of
divinity
law
and
medicine
all
he
had
learned
to
write
formal
prose
and
verse
to
a
remarkable
degree
of
artistry
had
learned
to
dispute
devastatingly
both
formally
and
informally
in
and
according
to
the
rules
on
any
topic
pro
or
con
drawn
from
almost
any
subject
more
especially
from
works
could
produce
carefully
constructed
orations
set
and
formal
speeches
artfully
and
prayerfully
made
by
writing
and
rewriting
with
all
the
aid
his
tutor
and
others
could
provide
and
then
delivered
verbatim
from
memory
had
also
learned
to
dispute
extempore
remarkably
well
the
main
evidence
for
which
of
course
is
the
presence
of
his
name
in
the
honors
list
of
also
displayed
the
ability
to
write
verse
on
almost
any
topic
of
dispute
the
verses
of
course
to
be
delivered
from
memory
we
have
surviving
at
least
one
instance
of
a
poem
prepared
for
another
in
non
and
perhaps
also
the
his
greatest
achievement
in
his
own
eyes
and
in
the
eyes
of
his
colleagues
and
teachers
was
his
amazing
ability
to
produce
literary
pieces
and
he
was
often
called
on
to
do
so
were
his
public
academic
activities
domi
forisque
in
the
college
and
in
the
university
his
performances
attracted
much
attention
as
the
frequency
of
his
surviving
pieces
in
any
calendar
that
may
be
set
up
for
his
undergraduate
activities
testifies
other
activities
are
not
so
easily
recovered
statements
about
sports
and
exercises
of
a
physical
nature
are
suggestive
but
inconclusive
later
boastings
of
his
skill
with
the
small
sword
are
indicative
of
much
time
and
practice
devoted
to
the
use
of
that
weapon
and
others
have
dealt
with
sports
and
pastimes
at
in
day
with
not
very
specific
results
himself
uncommunicative
as
he
is
about
his
lesser
and
nonliterary
activities
at
least
gives
us
some
evidence
that
he
was
a
great
walker
under
any
and
all
conditions
early
poems
and
some
of
his
prose
prolusions
speak
of
wanderings
in
the
city
and
the
neighboring
country
that
may
be
extended
to
and
its
surrounding
countryside
town
itself
and
the
reedy
he
often
visited
as
did
all
in
the
university
churches
the
taverns
and
the
various
other
places
of
the
town
must
have
known
his
figure
well
as
he
roved
to
and
about
them
tiny
hamlet
of
to
the
north
with
the
fens
and
marshes
lying
on
down
the
may
have
attracted
him
often
as
it
did
many
other
youths
of
the
time
to
the
southeast
afforded
him
and
all
other
students
a
vantage
point
from
which
to
view
the
town
and
university
of
their
dwelling
country
about
is
flat
and
not
particularly
spectacular
in
its
scenery
though
it
offers
easy
going
to
the
foot
traveler
games
especially
football
required
some
attention
and
other
organized
sports
may
have
attracted
him
as
participant
or
spectator
smoked
as
did
everybody
and
imbibed
the
various
alcoholic
beverages
of
that
day
although
his
protestations
while
at
and
after
that
he
was
no
drunkard
point
to
reasonable
abstinence
from
the
wild
drinking
bouts
of
some
of
the
undergraduates
and
we
must
add
of
some
of
their
elders
including
many
of
the
regents
or
teachers
manner
of
person
does
appear
to
have
been
when
as
an
undergraduate
he
resided
at
was
then
a
slightly
built
young
man
of
pleasing
appearance
medium
stature
and
handsome
face
as
his
fencing
and
dancing
lessons
had
taught
him
to
be
in
addition
to
the
natural
grace
of
his
slight
wiry
frame
he
cut
enough
of
a
figure
to
have
evoked
a
nickname
in
the
college
to
which
he
himself
referred
in
quibusdam
audivi
nuper
is
if
we
can
trust
that
most
specious
of
prolusions
packed
as
it
is
with
wit
and
persiflage
sounds
real
enough
if
we
could
only
trust
the
conditions
under
which
we
learn
of
its
use
but
anyone
who
would
put
much
trust
in
any
phase
of
except
its
illusive
allusiveness
deserves
whatever
fate
may
be
meted
out
to
him
by
virtue
of
the
egregiously
stilted
banter
short
the
traditional
epithet
for
of
of
while
eminently
fitting
rests
only
on
this
baffling
passage
in
the
midst
of
the
most
treacherous
piece
of
writing
left
us
mention
of
it
and
comes
from
this
prolusion
through
or
is
not
a
question
of
truth
or
falsity
the
prolusion
in
which
the
autobiographic
statement
about
the
epithet
occurs
is
such
a
mass
of
intentionally
buried
allusions
that
almost
nothing
in
it
can
be
accepted
as
true
or
discarded
as
false
entire
exercise
and
is
most
suggestive
of
the
kind
of
person
had
become
at
during
his
undergraduate
career
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
selected
though
as
a
substitute
to
act
as
interlocutor
or
moderator
for
it
or
perhaps
we
should
say
with
as
father
of
the
act
is
in
itself
a
difficult
phase
of
his
development
to
grasp
was
to
act
as
the
archfool
the
supreme
wit
the
lightly
bantering
pater
who
could
at
once
trip
lightly
over
that
which
deserved
such
treatment
or
could
at
will
annihilate
the
common
enemies
of
the
college
gathering
and
with
words
alone
an
exercise
involving
merely
raucous
comedy
in
his
hands
the
performance
turned
into
a
revel
of
wit
and
word
play
indecent
at
times
but
always
learned
pointed
and
carefully
aimed
at
some
individuals
present
and
at
the
whole
assembly
do
this
successfully
required
great
skill
and
a
special
talent
for
both
solemn
and
ribald
raillery
a
talent
not
bestowed
on
many
persons
but
one
with
which
was
marked
as
being
endowed
and
in
which
at
least
in
this
performance
he
obviously
reveled
may
be
thought
unfortunate
that
he
was
called
on
entirely
by
accident
to
perform
if
again
we
may
trust
the
opening
of
the
oratio
for
it
marks
the
beginning
for
us
of
his
use
of
his
peculiar
form
of
witty
word
play
that
even
in
this
banter
has
in
it
the
unmistakable
element
of
viciousness
and
an
almost
sadistic
delight
in
verbally
tormenting
an
adversary
the
real
beginnings
of
this
development
in
him
go
back
to
the
opposing
of
grammar
school
and
probably
if
it
had
not
been
this
occasion
and
these
lines
it
would
have
been
some
others
such
as
the
first
prolusion
that
set
off
this
streak
in
him
of
unbridled
and
scathing
verbal
attack
on
an
enemy
western
would
hear
and
listen
to
him
in
this
same
vein
about
the
middle
of
the
century
these
prolusions
that
we
have
surviving
from
the
days
are
only
one
phase
of
his
existence
then
his
most
important
private
activity
was
the
combination
of
reading
discussion
with
a
few
if
we
can
trust
his
writings
to
and
the
younger
very
few
congenial
companions
of
later
point
to
a
friendship
with
who
entered
other
names
among
the
young
men
in
residence
at
the
time
seem
to
have
been
even
suggested
by
as
those
of
persons
with
whom
he
in
any
way
consorted
that
scarcely
means
that
he
was
the
aloof
forbidding
type
of
student
who
shared
few
if
any
activities
with
his
fellows
the
banter
of
the
surviving
prolusions
providing
enough
evidence
to
deny
this
he
was
not
a
participant
in
the
college
or
university
theatricals
which
he
once
attacked
as
utterly
unworthy
performances
see
but
even
in
that
famous
passage
was
aiming
not
at
the
theatricals
as
such
but
at
their
performance
by
persons
either
or
presently
to
enter
into
the
ministry
fact
that
he
nowhere
mentioned
theatrical
performances
as
part
of
the
activities
of
the
boys
later
in
his
hypothetical
academy
should
not
be
taken
too
seriously
as
evidence
that
he
desired
them
to
eschew
such
performances
in
that
short
piece
or
letter
written
to
in
which
he
sketched
his
scheme
for
educating
young
men
he
merely
overlooked
that
phase
of
their
exercises
of
this
class
of
science
fiction
have
clearly
in
mind
the
assumptions
that
man
can
master
the
principles
of
this
universe
and
that
such
mastery
will
necessarily
better
the
human
lot
the
other
hand
the
bright
vision
of
the
future
has
been
directly
stated
in
science
fiction
concerned
with
projecting
ideal
societies
science
fiction
of
course
is
related
if
sometimes
distantly
to
that
utopian
literature
optimistic
about
science
literature
whose
period
of
greatest
vigor
in
the
late
nineteenth
and
early
twentieth
centuries
produced
and
though
written
after
the
present
flood
of
dystopias
began
we
can
see
the
bright
vision
of
science
fiction
clearly
defined
apparently
indebted
to
romance
and
also
to
especially
and
describes
the
bloodless
conquest
of
earth
by
the
vastly
superior
creatures
who
come
to
our
world
in
order
to
prepare
the
human
race
for
its
next
stage
of
development
an
eventual
merging
with
the
composite
mind
of
the
universe
just
in
time
to
stop
men
from
turning
their
planet
into
a
radioactive
wasteland
the
unite
earth
into
one
world
in
which
justice
order
and
benevolence
prevail
and
ignorance
poverty
and
fear
have
ceased
to
exist
their
rule
earth
becomes
a
technological
utopia
abolition
of
war
and
new
techniques
of
production
particularly
robot
factories
greatly
increase
the
wealth
a
situation
described
in
the
following
passage
which
has
the
true
utopian
ring
was
so
cheap
that
the
necessities
of

and

vigor
and
energy
to
construct
a
new
human
life
rebuilding
entire
cities
expanding

for

providing

for

indeed
for
the
first

giving
everyone
the
chance
to

his
talents
to
the
fullest
as
a
result
attains
previously
undreamed
of
levels
of
civilization
and
culture
a
golden
age
which
the
a
very
evident
symbol
of
science
have
helped
produce
by
introducing
reason
and
the
scientific
method
into
human
activities
science
is
the
savior
of
mankind
and
in
this
respect
only
blueprints
in
greater
detail
the
vision
of
the
future
which
though
not
always
so
directly
stated
has
nevertheless
been
present
in
the
minds
of
most
writers
then
the
optimism
which
has
permeated
science
fiction
for
so
long
what
is
really
remarkable
is
that
during
the
last
twelve
years
many
writers
have
turned
about
and
attacked
their
own
cherished
vision
of
the
future
have
attacked
the
kind
of
faith
that
science
and
technology
will
inevitably
better
the
human
condition
they
have
done
this
on
a
very
large
scale
with
a
veritable
flood
of
novels
and
stories
which
are
either
dystopias
or
narratives
of
adventure
with
dystopian
elements
of
the
means
of
publication
magazines
and
cheap
paperbacks
and
because
dystopian
science
fiction
is
still
appearing
in
quantity
the
full
range
and
extent
of
this
phenomenon
can
hardly
be
known
though
one
fact
is
evident
the
imagination
has
been
immensely
fertile
in
its
extrapolations
the
dystopias
for
example
portrays
the
deadly
effects
on
human
life
of
the
of
the
future
describes
a
world
hiding
from
its
own
weapons
of
destruction
in
underground
shelters
presents
a
society
in
which
wall
television
and
radios
enslave
minds
finds
men
after
the
great
atomic
disaster
stumbling
back
to
their
previous
level
of
civilization
and
another
catastrophe
predicts
an
economy
of
abundance
which
in
order
to
remain
prosperous
must
set
its
robots
to
consuming
surplus
production
tells
of
a
future
when
robots
have
taken
over
leaving
men
nothing
to
do
and
describes
a
world
which
frightened
by
the
powers
of
destruction
science
has
given
it
becomes
static
and
conformist
more
complete
list
would
also
include
and
as
well
as
the
three
perhaps
most
outstanding
dystopias
and
and
works
which
we
will
later
examine
in
detail
novels
and
stories
like
with
the
focus
on
adventure
and
with
the
dystopian
elements
only
a
dim
background
in
this
case
an
uneasy
overpopulated
world
in
which
the
mass
of
people
do
uninteresting
routine
jobs
while
a
carefully
selected
elite
runs
everything
are
in
all
likelihood
as
numerous
as
dystopias
is
of
course
nothing
new
about
dystopias
for
they
belong
to
a
literary
tradition
which
including
also
the
closely
related
satiric
utopias
stretches
from
at
least
as
far
back
as
the
eighteenth
century
and
to
the
twentieth
century
and
and
and
which
in
science
fiction
is
represented
before
the
present
deluge
as
early
as
trilogy
and
and
as
recently
as
the
classic
story
of
men
replaced
by
their
own
robots
makes
the
current
phenomenon
unique
is
that
so
many
writers
have
reversed
a
trend
and
turned
to
writing
works
critical
of
the
impact
of
science
and
technology
on
human
life
the
great
flood
of
these
dystopias
has
appeared
only
in
the
last
twelve
years
it
seems
fairly
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
chief
impetus
was
the
publication
of
an
assumption
which
is
supported
by
the
frequent
echoes
of
such
details
as
along
with
education
by
conditioning
from
a
book
to
which
writers
may
well
have
returned
with
new
interest
after
reading
the
more
powerful
dystopia
all
recent
science
fiction
however
is
dystopian
for
the
optimistic
strain
is
still
very
much
alive
in
and
as
we
have
seen
as
well
as
in
many
other
recent
popular
novels
and
stories
like
and
among
works
of
dystopian
science
fiction
not
all
provide
intelligent
criticism
and
very
few
have
much
merit
as
literature
but
then
real
quality
has
always
been
scarce
in
science
fiction
addition
there
are
many
areas
of
the
human
situation
besides
the
impact
of
science
and
technology
which
are
examined
for
dystopias
often
extrapolate
political
social
economic
tendencies
only
indirectly
related
to
science
and
technology
with
all
these
qualifications
and
exceptions
the
current
dystopian
phenomenon
remains
impressive
for
its
criticism
that
science
and
technology
instead
of
bringing
utopia
may
well
enslave
dehumanize
and
even
destroy
men
effectively
these
warnings
can
be
presented
is
seen
in
and
and
the
best
known
of
these
three
novels
is
a
good
example
of
a
dystopia
which
extrapolates
much
more
than
the
impact
of
science
on
human
life
though
its
most
important
warning
is
in
this
area
namely
as
to
the
use
to
which
discoveries
in
the
behavioral
sciences
may
be
put
novel
which
is
not
merely
dystopian
but
also
brilliantly
satiric
describes
a
future
where
of
the
population
the
men
who
run
advertising
agencies
and
big
corporations
control
the
rest
of
the
people
the
submerged
who
are
the
workers
and
consumers
with
the
government
being
no
more
than
a
clearing
house
for
pressures
ours
the
economy
of
the
space
merchants
must
constantly
expand
in
order
to
survive
and
like
ours
it
is
based
on
the
principle
of
ever
increasing
work
and
profits
in
the
circle
of
consumption
consequences
of
course
have
been
dreadful
reckless
expansion
has
led
to
overpopulation
pollution
of
the
earth
and
depletion
of
its
natural
resources
example
even
the
most
successful
executive
lives
in
a
apartment
while
ordinary
people
rent
space
in
the
stairwells
of
office
buildings
in
which
to
sleep
at
night
soyaburgers
have
replaced
meat
and
wood
has
become
so
precious
that
it
is
saved
for
expensive
jewelry
and
the
atmosphere
is
so
befouled
that
no
one
dares
walk
in
the
open
without
respirators
or
soot
plugs
indicates
as
has
correctly
observed
some
of
the
impending
consequences
of
the
growth
of
industrial
and
commercial
power
and
satirizes
existing
habits
in
the
advertising
profession
its
warning
and
analysis
penetrate
much
deeper
is
wrong
with
advertising
is
not
only
that
it
is
an
outrage
an
assault
on
mental
privacy
or
that
it
is
a
major
cause
for
a
wasteful
economy
of
abundance
or
that
it
contains
a
coercive
tendency
which
is
closer
to
the
point
what
and
are
really
doing
is
warning
against
the
dangers
inherent
in
perfecting
a
science
of
man
and
his
motives
like
such
humanist
documents
as
and
considers
what
may
result
from
the
scientific
study
of
human
nature
man
is
actually
the
product
of
his
environment
and
if
science
can
discover
the
laws
of
human
nature
and
the
ways
in
which
environment
determines
what
people
do
then
someone
a
someone
probably
standing
outside
traditional
systems
of
values
can
turn
around
and
develop
completely
efficient
means
for
controlling
people
we
will
have
a
society
consisting
of
the
planners
or
conditioners
and
the
controlled
this
of
course
is
exactly
what
has
been
accused
of
doing
albeit
in
a
primitive
way
with
its
hidden
persuaders
and
what
the
space
merchants
accomplish
with
much
greater
sophistication
and
precision
and
ad
men
have
long
since
thrown
out
appeals
to
reason
and
developed
techniques
of
advertising
which
tie
in
with
every
basic
trauma
and
neurosis
in
life
which
work
on
the
libido
of
consumers
which
are
linked
to
the
great
prime
motivations
of
the
human
spirit
the
hero
explains
before
his
conversion
the
job
of
advertising
is
to
convince
people
without
letting
them
know
that
being
convinced
to
do
this
requires
first
of
all
the
kind
of
information
about
people
which
is
provided
by
the
scientists
in
industrial
anthropology
and
consumer
research
who
for
example
tell
that
three
days
is
the
optimum
priming
period
for
a
closed
social
circuit
to
be
triggered
with
a
catalytic
which
means
that
an
effective
propaganda
technique
is
to
send
an
idea
into
circulation
and
then
three
days
later
reinforce
or
undermine
it
the
second
requirement
for
convincing
people
without
their
knowledge
is
artistic
talent
to
prepare
the
words
and
pictures
which
persuade
by
using
the
principles
which
the
scientists
have
discovered
the
copywriter
in
the
world
of
the
space
merchants
is
the
person
who
in
earlier
ages
might
have
been
a
lyric
poet
the
person
capable
of
putting
together
words
that
stir
and
move
and
sing
explains
in
this
profession
we
reach
into
the
souls
of
men
and
women
we
do
it
by
taking
talent
and
redirecting
it
the
basic
question
to
be
asked
in
this
situation
is
what
motivates
the
manipulators
that
is
what
are
their
values
since
as
says
should
play
with
lives
the
way
we
do
unless
motivated
by
the
highest
ideals
the
only
ideal
he
can
think
of
is
again
and
again
the
space
merchants
confirm
the
prediction
of
the
humanists
that
the
conditioners
and
behavioral
scientists
once
they
have
seen
through
human
nature
will
have
nothing
except
their
impulses
and
desires
to
guide
them
often
say
of
a
person
that
he
looks
young
for
his
age
or
old
for
his
age
even
in
the
more
extreme
of
such
cases
we
seldom
go
very
far
astray
in
guessing
what
his
age
actually
is
this
means
suppose
that
almost
invariably
age
reveals
itself
by
easily
recognizable
signs
engraved
on
both
the
body
and
the
mind
for
his
age
means
only
the
presence
of
some
minor
characteristic
not
quite
usual
quite
sufficient
for
diagnosis
are
nevertheless
there
assumption
of
youth
or
the
presence
of
a
few
youthful
characteristics
deceives
no
more
successfully
than
rouge
or
dyed
hair
young
for
your
age
means
for
your
age
and
it
means
no
more
mind
expressing
itself
in
words
may
reveal
itself
a
little
less
obviously
as
old
or
young
surface
loses
its
bloom
and
submits
to
its
wrinkles
in
ways
less
immediately
obvious
than
the
body
does
may
be
and
often
is
skeptical
cynical
or
despairing
age
may
be
idealistic
believing
and
much
given
to
professions
of
optimism
there
is
nevertheless
always
a
subtle
difference
in
the
way
in
which
supposedly
similar
opinions
are
held
pessimism
of
the
young
is
defiant
anxious
to
confess
or
even
exaggerate
its
ostensible
gloom
and
so
exuberant
as
to
reveal
the
fact
that
it
regards
its
ability
to
face
up
to
the
awful
truth
as
more
than
enough
to
compensate
for
the
awfulness
of
that
truth
the
optimism
of
age
protests
too
much
it
proclaims
that
the
best
is
yet
to
be
it
always
arouses
at
least
in
the
young
either
a
suspicious
question
or
perhaps
the
exclamation
of
the
youth
who
saw
on
a
tombstone
the
inscription
am
not
dead
but
sleeping
you
fooling
nobody
but
yourself
may
say
of
some
unfortunates
that
they
were
never
young
cannot
truthfully
say
of
anyone
who
has
succeeded
in
entering
deep
into
his
sixties
that
he
was
never
old
famous
lines
of
the
with
which
a
fading
beauty
dedicates
her
mirror
at
the
shrine
of
a
goddess
reveal
a
wise
attitude
take
my
votive
glass
am
not
what
was
from
this
day
shall
be
let
me
never
see
good
can
come
of
contemplating
the
sad
inevitable
fact
that
once
youth
has
passed
a
worse
and
worse
time
still
succeeds
the
former
there
are
at
least
two
reasons
for
contemplating
mind
in
even
a
cracked
mirror
is
that
there
sometimes
are
real
although
inadequate
compensations
in
growing
old
if
one
is
fortunate
enough
to
achieve
it
is
not
so
good
as
joy
but
it
is
something
to
be
from
hope
and
fear
set
free
is
at
least
better
than
to
have
lost
the
first
without
having
got
rid
of
the
second
other
reason
and
the
one
with
which
am
here
concerned
is
that
one
thus
becomes
inclined
to
inquire
of
any
opinion
or
change
of
opinion
whether
it
represents
the
wisdom
of
experience
or
is
only
the
result
of
the
difference
between
youth
and
age
which
is
as
inevitable
as
the
all
too
obvious
physical
differences
may
be
exasperatingly
aware
that
if
the
answer
is
favorable
it
will
be
judged
such
only
by
those
of
own
age
at
least
the
question
has
been
raised
readers
of
this
department
no
doubt
discount
certain
of
my
opinions
for
the
simple
reason
that
they
can
guess
pretty
accurately
even
if
they
have
never
actually
been
told
what
my
age
is
least
should
like
them
to
know
that
know
these
discounts
are
being
made
me
then
and
in
public
glance
into
the
mirror
have
known
some
men
and
women
who
said
that
the
selves
they
are
told
about
or
even
remember
seem
utter
strangers
to
them
now
that
their
remote
past
is
as
discontinuous
with
their
present
selves
as
lacking
in
any
conscious
likeness
to
their
mature
personality
as
the
self
of
a
butterfly
may
be
imagined
discontinuous
with
that
of
the
caterpillar
it
once
was
my
part
find
it
difficult
to
conceive
such
a
state
of
affairs
have
changed
and
have
reversed
opinions
but
am
so
aware
of
an
uninterrupted
continuity
of
the
persona
or
ego
that
see
only
as
absurd
the
tendency
of
some
psychologists
from
to
and
to
regard
consciousness
as
no
more
than
a
flux
amid
which
nothing
remains
unchanged
far
as
am
concerned
the
child
is
unmistakably
father
to
the
man
despite
the
obvious
fact
that
child
and
father
differ
greatly
sometimes
for
the
better
and
sometimes
for
the
worse
values
temperament
and
the
way
in
which
one
approaches
a
conviction
change
less
of
course
than
specific
opinions
fact
is
very
clearly
illustrated
in
the
case
of
the
many
intellectuals
who
were
or
in
their
youth
and
are
now
so
extremely
conservative
or
reactionary
as
many
would
say
that
they
can
define
no
important
political
conviction
that
does
not
seem
so
far
from
even
a
centrist
position
as
to
make
the
distinction
between
and
for
them
hardly
worth
noting
in
ways
more
fundamental
than
specific
political
opinions
they
are
still
what
they
always
were
passionate
sure
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
of
whatever
it
is
that
they
are
sure
of
capable
of
seeing
black
and
white
only
and
therefore
committed
to
the
logical
extreme
of
whatever
it
is
they
are
temporarily
committed
to
those
of
my
readers
who
find
many
of
my
opinions
morally
or
politically
or
sociologically
antiquated
and
have
reason
to
know
that
there
are
some
such
would
like
to
say
what
have
already
hinted
namely
that
some
of
my
opinions
may
indeed
be
subject
to
some
discount
on
the
simple
ground
that
am
no
longer
young
and
therefore
incapable
of
being
youthful
of
mind
will
also
remind
them
that
have
always
been
inclined
to
skepticism
to
a
kind
of
lack
of
commitment
so
far
as
public
affairs
are
concerned
so
that
although
not
as
eager
as
once
was
to
be
disapproved
of
can
still
resist
prevailing
opinions
about
the
age
of
twelve
became
a
liberal
and
have
always
considered
myself
a
liberal
of
some
kind
even
though
the
definition
has
changed
repeatedly
since
became
a
reactionary
times
in
my
youth
voted
the
ticket
but
less
because
was
than
because
was
not
either
a
or
a
and
voted
for
every
time
he
was
a
candidate
during
the
years
when
was
on
the
staff
of
tried
to
the
limit
the
patience
of
the
editors
on
almost
every
occasion
when
was
permitted
to
write
an
editorial
having
a
bearing
on
a
political
or
social
question
once
during
the
trying
thirties
did
come
so
close
to
succumbing
to
the
private
climate
of
opinion
as
to
grant
communism
even
that
most
of
encomiums
an
interesting
experiment
are
few
things
of
which
am
prouder
than
of
that
unblemished
record
of
my
friends
at
the
time
thought
that
had
received
a
condemnation
when
denounced
me
in
a
review
of
one
of
my
books
as
a
perfect
example
of
the
obsolete
man
who
could
understand
and
sympathize
only
with
the
dead
past
he
as
can
now
retort
was
the
man
who
could
see
so
short
a
distance
ahead
that
after
a
visit
to
he
gave
voice
to
the
famous
exclamation
have
seen
the
future
and
it
works
favorite
excuse
of
those
who
have
now
recanted
their
approval
of
communism
is
that
they
did
not
know
how
things
would
develop
this
excuse
have
never
been
much
impressed
was
it
seems
to
me
enough
in
the
openly
declared
principles
and
intentions
of
leaders
to
alienate
honorable
men
without
their
having
to
wait
to
see
how
it
would
turn
out
many
years
ago
sat
at
dinner
next
to
and
the
subject
of
came
up
asked
me
suddenly
are
your
political
opinions
replied
some
of
my
colleagues
on
the
paper
regard
me
as
a
rank
reactionary
a
thought
he
replied
still
leaves
you
a
lot
of
latitude
suppose
it
did
never
have
been
and
am
not
now
any
kind
of
utopian
first
came
across
pronouncement
the
remedy
for
the
ills
of
life
is
palliative
rather
than
radical
it
seemed
to
me
to
sum
up
the
profoundest
of
political
and
social
truths
will
probably
explain
more
of
my
attitudes
toward
society
than
any
other
phrase
or
principle
could
did
choose
to
fill
these
pages
in
this
particular
issue
with
this
mixture
of
rather
tenuous
reflections
and
autobiography
reason
is
think
my
awareness
that
my
remarks
last
quarter
on
pacifism
may
well
have
served
to
confirm
the
opinion
of
some
that
my
tendency
to
skepticism
and
dissent
gets
us
nowhere
and
that
am
simply
too
old
to
hope
would
however
like
to
suggest
that
wrong
though
may
be
the
tendency
to
see
dilemmas
rather
than
solutions
is
one
of
which
have
been
a
victim
ever
since
can
remember
and
therefore
not
merely
a
senile
phenomenon
know
that
one
must
act
one
need
not
always
be
sure
that
the
action
is
either
wise
or
conclusive
of
what
some
would
call
cynicism
remember
an
anecdote
the
source
of
which
forget
concerns
a
minister
who
staged
an
impressive
object
lesson
by
confining
a
lion
and
a
lamb
together
in
the
same
cage
outside
his
church
door
only
his
parishioners
but
the
whole
town
and
ultimately
the
whole
county
were
enormously
impressed
by
this
object
lesson
day
he
was
visited
by
a
delegation
of
imitators
who
wanted
to
know
his
secret
on
earth
do
you
manage
it
is
the
trick
he
replied
it
is
perfectly
simple
there
is
no
trick
involved
you
have
to
do
is
put
in
a
fresh
lamb
from
time
to
time
really
it
seems
to
me
promise
that
the
lion
and
the
lamb
will
lie
down
together
was
given
in
the
future
tense
is
not
something
that
can
be
expected
to
happen
now
really
changing
the
general
subject
take
this
opportunity
to
confess
that
am
troubled
by
doubts
not
only
about
pacifism
but
also
when
asked
to
join
in
the
protest
against
a
law
that
most
of
those
who
consider
themselves
humane
and
liberal
seem
to
regard
as
obviously
barbarous
namely
the
law
that
prescribes
the
death
penalty
for
murder
when
there
seem
to
be
no
extenuating
circumstances
is
not
that
am
unaware
of
the
force
of
their
strongest
contention
they
say
should
be
regarded
as
sacred
and
therefore
as
something
that
neither
an
individual
nor
his
society
has
a
right
to
take
away
fact
cannot
imagine
myself
condemning
a
man
to
the
noose
or
the
electric
chair
if
had
to
take
as
an
individual
the
responsibility
for
his
death
as
know
would
make
a
bad
soldier
even
though
cannot
sincerely
call
myself
a
pacifist
so
too
would
not
be
either
a
hangman
by
profession
or
if
could
avoid
it
even
a
member
of
a
hanging
jury
these
facts
the
question
no
murderer
ever
be
executed
to
me
to
create
a
dilemma
not
to
be
satisfactorily
disposed
of
by
a
simple
negative
answer
of
the
wrongdoer
so
liberals
are
inclined
to
say
can
have
only
three
possible
justifications
revenge
reformation
or
deterrent
example
here
if
anywhere
in
contemporary
literature
is
a
major
effort
to
counterbalance
and
restore
some
of
its
former
lustre
to
the
tarnished
image
of
the
species

as
himself
puts
it
to
make

presumably
after
being
smuggled
out
of

it

not
the
entire
book
that
wrote
at
that
time
it
is
only
the
first
section
of
a
novel
called
avec
and
this
first
section
was
somehow
preserved
there
are
always
these
annoying
little
mysteries
about
the
actual
facts
of

the
destroyed

are
to
believe
the
list
of
titles

in

is
still
engaged
in
writing
a
large
novel
under
his
original
title
as
he
remarks
in
his
preface
to
a
novel
can
hardly
ever
be
rewritten
and
when
this
one
appears
in
its
final
form
the
form
of
the
first
part
will
no
doubt
be
radically
changed
pretends
perhaps
with
a
trifle
too
a
modesty
that
his
fragmentary
work
will
accordingly
appeal
only
to
the
curiosity
of
bibliophiles
and
to
connoisseurs
of
what
might
have
been
in
its
present
form
however
the
first
part
of
unrecoverable
novel
is
among
the
greatest
works
of
century
literature
and
it
should
be
far
better
known
than
it
is
theme
of
is
most
closely
related
to
its
immediate
predecessor
in
array
of
novels
magnificent
but
greatly
underestimated
book
which
bodies
forth
the
very
form
and
pressure
of
its
time
as
no
other
comparable
creation
has
suffered
severely
from
having
been
written
about
an
historical
event
the
that
is
still
capable
of
fanning
the
smoldering
fires
of
old
political
feuds
so
apparently
impartial
a
critic
as
has
taken
for
granted
that
the
book
was
originally
intended
as
a
piece
of
propaganda
and
has
then
gone
on
to
argue
with
unimpeachable
consistency
that
all
the
obviously
aspects
of
the
book
are
simply
inadvertent
contradictions
however
could
be
farther
from
the
truth
whole
purpose
of
is
to
portray
the
tragic
dialectic
between
means
and
ends
inherent
in
all
organized
political
violence
and
even
when
such
violence
is
a
necessary
and
legitimate
of
liberty
justice
and
human
dignity
before
in
pages
have
we
met
such
impassioned
defenders
of
a
quality
of
man
which
transcends
the
realm
of
politics
and
even
the
realm
of
action
altogether

the
action
of

the
action

only
a
small

of
himself

to
haunt
the

amidst
all
the
exaltations
of
combat

to
make
an
appeal
for
a
larger
and
more
elemental
human
community
than
one
based
on
the
brutal
necessities
of
war
is
this
larger
theme
of
the
quality
of
man
a
quality
that
transcends
the
ideological
and
flows
into
the
human
which
now

the
world
of

good
measure

war
still
serves
as
a
catalyst

the
values

no

contrary

sombre
foil

at

reversed

which
may
also
lead
to
a

just
possible
that

aloof

the
necessity
of

efforts
to
achieve

to
the
formation

all

a

to

my
own

that
it
lies
within
the
realm
of
both
our
needs
and
our
capacity
a

nucleus

the

development

its

the
full
implementation
of
of
the
which

will
contribute
toward
the
further
development
of
peaceful
and
friendly
international
relations
by
strengthening
their
free
institutions

a
better
understanding
of
the
principles
upon
which
these
institutions
are
founded
and
by
promoting
conditions
of
stability
and
will
seek
to
eliminate
conflict
in
their

economic
policies

will
encourage

collaboration

wrote
in
cannot
live
on
fear

the
source
of

it

with
the
military
threat
which
first
brought
it

problem
of
is
not
one
of

of
which
there
is
an

of
the

available
as
an
executive
agency
the

a
high

unofficial
of

available
as
a
potential
legislative

machinery
will
not
become
the
instrument
of
an
community
by
fiat
but
only
when
that
community
evolves
from
potentiality
to
reality
existence
of
a
community
is
a
state
of
mind
a
conviction
that
goals
and
values
are
widely
shared
that
effective
communication
is
possible
that
mutual
trust
is
reasonably
assured
equally
promising
avenue
toward
community
may
lie
through
the
development
and
expansion
of

an
organ

cooperation
there
is
no
reason
why
cannot
evolve
into
a
broader
instrument
of
union
if
its
members
so
desire
it
might
be
a
more
appropriate
vehicle
than
for
the
development
of
a
parliamentary
organ
of
the
nations
because
it
could
encompass
all
of
the
members
of
the
community
including
those
like
and
who
are
unwilling
to
be
associated
with
an
essentially
military
alliance
like
these
hopes
and
prescriptions
is
a
conviction
that
the
nations
of
the
area
do
indeed
form
a
community
at
least
a
potential
community
is
nothing
new
in
this
what
is
new
and
compelling
is
that
the
is
now
but
one
of
several
powerful
civilizations
or
systems
and
that
one
or
more
of
the
others
may
pose
a
mortal
danger
to
the
centuries
the
nations
dominated
the
world
and
as
long
as
they
did
they
could
afford
the
luxury
of
fighting
each
other
time
is
now
past
and
the
nations
if
they
are
to
survive
must
develop
a
community
and
they
must
also
look
beyond
the
frontiers
of
civilization
toward
a
concert
of
free
nations
burden
of
these
reflections
is
that
a
broader
unity
among
the
free
nations
is
at
the
core
of
our
needs
if
we
do
not
aspire
to
too
much
it
is
also
within
our
capacity
realistic
balancing
of
the
need
for
new
forms
of
international
organization
on
the
one
hand
and
our
capacity
to
achieve
them
on
the
other
must
be
approached
through
the
concept
of
community
has
demonstrated
many
times
that
concerts
of
nations
based
solely
on
the
negative
spur
of
common
danger
are
unlikely
to
survive
when
the
external
danger
ceases
to
be
dramatically
urgent
when
a
concert
of
nations
rests
on
the
positive
foundations
of
shared
goals
and
values
is
it
likely
to
form
a
viable
instrument
of
policy
follows
that
the
solution
to
the
current
disunity
of
the
free
nations
is
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
a
matter
of
devising
new
machinery
of
consultation
and
coordination
is
very
much
a
matter
of
building
the
foundations
of
community
is
for
these
reasons
that
proposals
for
a
new
world
order
through
radical
overhaul
of
the
or
through
some
sort
of
world
federation
are
utterly
fatuous
a
recent
book
called
two
distinguished
lawyers
and
call
for
just
such
an
overhaul
of
the
basing
their
case
on
the
fear
of
a
nuclear
holocaust
believe
that
these
proposals
however
meritorious
in
terms
of
world
needs
go
far
beyond
our
capacity
to
realize
them
proposals
look
to
an
apocalyptic
act
a
kind
of
social
contract
on
a
scale
defect
of
these
proposals
is
in
their
attempt
to
outrun
history
and
their
assumption
that
because
something
may
be
desirable
it
is
also
possible
working
concept
of
the
organic
evolution
of
community
must
lead
us
in
a
different
direction
failures
of
the
and
of
other
international
organs
suggest
that
we
have
already
gone
beyond
what
was
internationally
feasible
problem
therefore
is
to
devise
processes
more
modest
in
their
aspirations
adjusted
to
the
real
world
of
sovereign
nation
states
and
diverse
and
hostile
communities
history
of
the
demonstrates
that
in
a
pluralistic
world
we
must
develop
processes
of
influence
and
persuasion
rather
than
coercion
is
possible
that
international
organization
will
ultimately
supplant
the
system
but
its
proper
function
for
the
immediate
future
is
to
reform
and
supplement
that
system
in
order
to
render
pluralism
more
compatible
with
an
interdependent
world
machinery
of
coordination
should
not
be
our
primary
objective
in
the
foreseeable
future
though
perhaps
the
political
general
staff
of
leaders
proposed
by
would
serve
a
useful
purpose
however
there
is
an
abundance
of
available
machinery
of
coordination
in
in
in
the
and
elsewhere
trouble
with
this
machinery
is
that
it
is
not
used
and
the
reason
that
it
is
not
used
is
the
absence
of
a
conscious
sense
of
community
among
the
free
nations
proper
objective
then
is
the
development
of
a
new
spirit
the
realization
of
a
potential
community
concert
of
free
nations
should
take
its
inspiration
from
the
traditions
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
with
its
common
values
and
accepted
rules
of
the
game
of

by
themselves

history
of
both
the
of
and
the
demonstrates
that
a
powerful
sense
of
community
even
with
little
or
no
machinery
means
a
great
deal
is
the
lesson
of
the
nineteenth
century
realistic
concert
of
free
nations
might
be
expected
to
consist
of
an
inner
community

outer

to
he
was
a
hero
and
very
contemporary
probably
almost
every
not
only
knew
who
was
but
had
some
kind
of
emotional
feeling
about
him
exploited
this
national
sentiment
by
making
his
hero
a
private
detective
since
has
undergone
a
metamorphosis
he
has
become
on
a
mouthpiece
of
arbitrary
police
authority
has
like
so
many
other
secular
and
religious
culture
symbols
gone
over
to
the
side
of
the
ruling
classes
the
private
eye
can
have
no
more
appeal
for
fill
the
job
of
contemporary
hero
in
needed
someone
else
was
logical
that
he
would
come
up
with
the
figure
of
the
modern
jazz
musician
revolution
in
jazz
that
took
place
around
the
evolution
from
the
bebop
school
of
to
the
cool
sound
of
and
and
the
whole
legend
of
had
made
an
impression
on
many
academic
and
literary
men
differentiation
between
the
and
schools
of
jazz
the
differences
between
the
hard
bop
school
of
and
the
cerebral
experiments
of
and
the
general
differences
in
the
mores
of
white
and
musicians
all
had
become
fairly
well
known
to
certain
segments
of
the
public
immense
amount
of
interest
that
the
new
jazz
had
for
the
younger
generation
must
have
impressed
him
and
he
began
working
toward
the
merger
of
jazz
and
poetry
as
he
had
previously
attempted
the
union
of
graphic
art
and
poetry
addition
to
his
experiments
in
reading
poetry
to
jazz
is
beginning
to
use
the
figure
of
the
modern
jazz
musician
as
a
myth
hero
in
the
same
way
he
used
the
figure
of
the
private
detective
a
decade
ago
this
respect
his
approach
to
is
in
marked
contrast
to
uses
many
of
his
early
poems
when
he
reads
to
jazz
including
many
of
his
and
translations
he
usually
draws
some
kind
of
comparison
with
the
jazz
tradition
and
the
poem
he
is
reading
for
instance
he
draws
the
parallel
between
a
poem
he
reads
about
an
courtesan
waiting
for
the
man
she
loves
and
who
never
comes
and
the
old
blues
chants
of
and
other
singers
but
usually
the
comparison
is
specious
may
sometimes
achieve
an
effective
juxtaposition
but
he
rarely
makes
any
effort
to
capture
any
jazz
feeling
in
the
text
of
his
poems
relying
on
his
very
competent
musicians
to
supply
this
feeling
does
read
some
of
his
earlier
works
to
music
but
he
has
written
an
entire
book
of
short
poems
which
seem
to
be
especially
suited
for
reading
with
jazz
new
poems
have
only
a
few
direct
references
to
jazz
and
jazz
musicians
but
they
show
changes
in
approach
to
his
poetry
for
he
has
tried
to
enter
into
and
understand
the
emotional
attitude
of
the
jazz
musician
is
difficult
to
draw
the
line
between
stereotype
and
the
reality
of
the
jazz
musician
knows
that
private
detectives
in
real
life
are
not
like
and
but
the
real
and
the
imaginary
musician
are
closely
linked
by
the
public
the
musician
is
the
underdog
par
excellence
is
forced
to
play
for
little
money
and
must
often
take
another
job
to
live
approach
to
music
is
highly
individualistic
the
accent
is
on
improvisation
rather
than
arrangements
he
is
worldly
the
musician
often
cultivates
public
attitudes
of
childlike
astonishment
and
naivete
musician
is
and
he
is
far
from
being
a
literary
hero
yet
is
a
creative
artist
of
these
aspects
will
be
seen
as
comparable
to
those
of
the
ideal
detective
but
where
the
detective
is
active
and
militant
the
jazz
musician
is
passive
almost
a
victim
of
society
order
to
write
with
authority
either
about
musicians
or
as
a
musician
would
have
to
soft
pedal
his
characteristically
outspoken
anger
and
change
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
this
poetry
from
a
revolutionary
to
a
victim
must
become
one
who
knows
all
about
the
injustice
in
the
world
but
who
declines
doing
anything
about
it
involves
a
shift
in
attitude
and
it
is
a
first
step
toward
writing
a
new
jazz
poetry
has
shown
considerable
ingenuity
in
adapting
his
earliest
symbols
and
devices
to
the
new
work
and
the
fact
that
he
has
kept
a
body
of
constant
symbols
through
all
of
his
experiments
gives
an
unexpected
continuity
to
his
poetry
tracing
some
of
these
more
important
symbols
through
the
body
of
his
work
will
show
that
new
poetry
is
well
thought
out
and
remains
within
the
mainstream
of
his
work
while
being
suited
to
a
new
form
characterized
as
a
man
of
anger
and
light
revolutionary
anger
is
apparent
in
most
of
his
early
poems
following
passage
from
illustrates
the
directness
of
this
anger
help
was
born
angry
that
my
father
was
being
burnt
alive
in
the
mills
that
none
of
us
knew
anything
but
filth
and
poverty
because
was
that
very
one
somebody
was
supposed
be
fighting
for
angry
and
exasperated
stance
which
has
maintained
in
his
poetry
for
almost
fifteen
years
has
been
successfully
modulated
into
a
kind
of
woe
that
is
as
effective
as
anger
and
still
expresses
his
disapproval
of
the
modern
world
his
recent
book
one
of
the
most
important
short
poems
and
it
is
the
title
poem
for
one
of
the
long
jazz
arrangements
is
written
for
recital
with
jazz
it
does
not
follow
the
metrical
rules
for
a
blues
to
be
sung
the
phrases
themselves
carry
a
blues
feeling
went
to
the
city
there
did
like
asses
living
like
sheep
hold
the
of
my
love
hold
her
little
white
went
to
the
city
there
did
bitterly
cry
out
of
touch
with
the
earth
with
never
a
glance
at
the
sky
hold
the
of
my
love
hold
her
pure
little
is
still
the
rebel
but
he
writes
in
a
doleful
mournful
tone
of
these
poems
is
an
aberration
each
is
so
typical
that
it
represents
a
prominent
trend
in
the
development
is
repeatedly
preoccupied
with
death
many
of
his
poems
death
comes
by
train
a
strongly
evocative
visual
image
was
once
involved
in
a
train
accident
and
this
passage
from
may
have
been
how
the
accident
appeared
to
the
poet
when
he
first
saw
it
if
he
did
love
us
look
at
all
the
disconnected
limbs
floating
hereabouts
like
bloody
feathers
at
that
and
all
the
eyes
are
talking
and
all
the
hair
are
moving
and
all
the
tongue
are
in
all
the
cheek
us
see
just
how
typical
is
is
and
spent
one
year
at
the
of
because
went
there
returned
to
to
work
for
to
edit
a
pulp
to
duck
the
war
in
the
to
write
publicity
for
and
commentary
for
a
newsreel
then
he
began
his
career
as
critic
for
various
magazines
he
has
abandoned
all
that
to
be
do
not
want
to
quibble
about
typicality
in
a
certain
sense
one
manner
of
experience
will
be
typical
of
any
given
group
while
another
will
not
got
news
for
not
typical
pretty
special
may
typify
a
certain
kind
of
postwar
experience
but
his
experience
is
certainly
not
typical
of
his
any
case
who
ever
thought
that
is
typical
of
anything
of
age
aspirations
and
level
of
sophistication
were
typically
involved
in
politics
before
the
war
did
not
duck
the
war
but
they
fought
in
it
however
reluctantly
they
sweated
out
some
kind
of
formal
education
they
read
widely
and
eclectically
they
did
not
fall
into
jobs
on
magazines
but
they
did
whatever
nasty
thing
they
could
get
in
order
to
eat
they
found
out
who
they
were
and
what
they
could
do
then
within
the
limits
of
their
talent
they
did
it
did
not
worry
about
experience
because
experience
thrust
itself
upon
them
they
traveled
out
of
a
native
could
believe
that
is
now
or
ever
was
a
literary
center
is
a
publishing
and
public
relations
center
but
these
very
facts
prevent
it
from
being
a
literary
center
because
writers
dislike
provincialism
and
untruth
typicality
consists
only
in
his
view
that
is
the
world
he
displays
what
outlanders
call
the
mind
a
state
that
the
subject
is
necessarily
unable
to
perceive
in
himself
mind
is
two
parts
abstraction
and
one
part
misinformation
about
the
rest
of
the
country
and
in
fact
the
world
his
fulminating
against
the
literary
world
is
really
struggling
with
the
in
himself
but
a
losing
battle
related
to
his
illusions
about
his
typicality
is
complicated
feeling
about
his
writes
of
my
friends
and
were
we
were
also
literary
the
combination
of
the
intellectual
tradition
and
the
sensibility
needed
to
be
a
writer
created
in
my
circle
the
most
potent
and
incredible
ambition
have
ever
seen
or
could
ever
have
imagined
themselves
just
as
people
my
friends
were
often
tortured
and
unappeasably
bitter
about
being
the
offspring
of
this
unhappily
breed
their
reading
and
thinking
gave
an
extension
to
their
normal
blushes
about
appearing
in
subway
bus
racetrack
movie
house
any
of
the
public
places
that
used
to
make
the
of
my
generation
heavy
thinkers
walking
across
without
their
glasses
on
willing
to
dare
the
trucks
as
long
as
they
look
like
the
caricature
of
the
intellectual
other
points
in
his
narrative
associates
with
unappeasable
literary
ambition
with
abstraction
with
his
personal
turning
aside
from
the
good
the
true
and
the
beautiful
of
fiction
in
the
manner
of
to
the
international
the
false
and
the
inflated
says
in
short
that
he
is
a
suffering
only
possible
answer
to
that
is
am
a
suffering
all
love
to
suffer
but
some
of
us
love
to
suffer
more
than
others
gone
farther
from
than
he
might
have
discovered
that
large
numbers
of
do
not
find
his
version
of
the
lot
remotely
recognizable
important
is
the
simple
human
point
that
all
men
suffer
and
that
it
is
a
kind
of
pride
on
the
part
of
the
to
believe
that
his
suffering
is
more
poignant
than
mine
or
anyone
is
not
to
deny
the
existence
of
pogroms
and
ghettos
but
only
to
assert
that
these
horrors
have
had
an
effect
on
the
nerves
of
people
who
did
not
experience
them
that
among
the
various
side
effects
is
the
local
hysteria
of
writers
and
intellectuals
who
cry
out
from
confusion
which
they
call
oppression
and
pain
their
stupidity
and
arrogance
they
believe
they
are
called
upon
to
remind
the
gentile
continually
of
pogroms
and
ghettos
of
us
have
imagination
and
sensibility
too
there
is
the
undeniable
fact
that
some
of
the
finest
fiction
is
being
written
by
but
it
is
not
fiction
and
through
intellectual
toughness
perception
through
experience
in
fact
have
obviously
liberated
themselves
from
any
sentimental
they
might
have
been
tempted
to
main
attack
is
upon
the
aesthetic
and
the
publishing
apparatus
of
literary
culture
in
our
day
was
able
to
get
an
advance
for
a
novel
and
time
and
opportunity
to
write
at
but
it
was
no
good
had
natural
sock
he
says
as
a
storyteller
and
was
precociously
good
at
description
dialogue
and
most
of
the
other
staples
of
the
trade
but
was
bugged
by
a
mammoth
complex
of
thoughts
and
feelings
that
prevented
me
from
doing
more
than
just
diddling
the
surface
of
sustained
again
how
can
you
write
when
you
yet
read
came
to
believe
that
the
novel
as
a
form
had
outlived
its
vital
meaning
articulate
friends
convinced
him
that
education
read
reading
was
a
must
moved
in
a
highly
intellectual
group
in
in
the
late
forties
becoming
internationalized
overnight
followed
a
period
in
which
he
wrote
reviews
for
had
a
small
piece
in
and
moved
on
to
and
work
for
was
more
satisfying
than
work
for

of
the
tiptoeing
fear
of
making
a

was
a

of
the
magazines

with

fear

failed
says
for

aristocratically
alienated
from
the
was
the
creation
of
a
monstrous
historical
period
wherein
it
thought
it
had
to
synthesize
literature
and
politics
and
art
of
every
kind
with
its
writers
crazily
trying
to
outdo
each
other
in
inclusiveness
and
operated
in
an
chill
their
example
caused
and
his
friends
to
put
on
airs
affect
all
sorts
of
impressive
scholarship
and
unnaturalness
in
order
to
slip
through
their
narrow
transoms
and
get
into
their
pages
as
the
intellectuals
used
to
say
all
this
raving
is
performing
a
traditional
and
by
now
boring
rite
the
attack
on
intelligence
upon
the
largely
successful
attempt
of
the
magazines
he
castigates
to
liberate
writing
from
local
color
and
other
varieties
of
romantic
corn
knows
that
and
the
rest
often
were
and
remain
guilty
of
intellectual
flatulence
jargon
approximations
to
but
modish
fiction
and
outrages
to
common
sense
have
often
disfigured
and
in
lesser
degree
the
other
magazines
on
the
list
ignores
in
his
contempt
for
history
and
for
accuracy
is
that
these
magazines
foremost
brought
about
a
genuine
revolution
in
the
mind
from
the
to
approximately
most
obvious
characteristic
of
contemporary
writing
apart
from
the
beat
nonsense
is
its
cosmopolitanism
process
of
cosmopolitanism
had
begun
in
earnest
about
but
the
and
the
depression
virtually
stalled
that
process
in
its
tracks
the
good
magazines
without
their
book
reviews
their
hospitality
to
writers
without
above
all
their
awareness
of
literary
standards
we
might
very
well
have
had
a
generation
of
heroes
and
might
add
and
and
in
verse
and
then
where
would
we
be
stewed
and
tattooed
as
might
say
after
reading
a
book
about
sailors
and
set
up
shop
was
still
accepted
as
an
arbiter
of
taste
remember
and
were
honored
in
odd
quarters
and
the
whole
sic
atmosphere
lay
thick
as
smog
over
the
country
economics
sociology
the
entire
area
of
life
that
lies
between
literature
and
what
calls
experience
urgently
needed
to
be
dug
into
universities
certainly
were
not
doing
it
nor
were
the
popular
magazines
of
the
day
above
all
did
if
it
had
never
printed
a
word
of
literature
its
contribution
to
the
area
would
still
be
historic
it
did
print
good
verse
and
good
fiction
the
editors
sometimes
dozed
and
printed
pretentious
dross
they
also
printed
and
a
host
of
other
good
writers
and
the
other
literary
magazines
helped
to
educate
in
the
best
sense
an
entire
generation
these
magazines
also
deluded
the
of
the
world
is
unfortunate
but
inevitable
is
a
fact
of
life
that
magazines
are
edited
by
groups
they
have
to
be
or
they
be
published
at
all
it
is
also
a
fact
of
life
that
there
will
always
be
youngish
people
around
who
will
be
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
what
looks
like
a
literary
movement
there
are
no
literary
movements
there
are
only
writers
doing
their
work
movements
are
the
creation
of
pimps
who
live
off
writers
when
says
mine
was
as
severe
a
environment
as
can
be
imagined
he
is
off
his
rocker
indicates
that
he
has
none
of
the
disciplines
that
criticism
requires
including
education
the
result
was
his
inevitable
bedazzlement
through
ignorance
being
educated
in
those
as
he
claims
one
was
ever
educated
through
in
anything
other
than
to
quote
him
again
perfumed
bullshit
a
hick
would
expect
to
find
the
literary
life
in
at
any
point
later
than
day
highly
intellectual
minds
that
says
he
encountered
in
the
did
their
work
in
spite
of
not
because
of
any
atmosphere
complaint
is
important
because
not
only
in
but
in
other
cities
and
in
universities
throughout
this
country
young
and
not
so
young
men
at
this
moment
are
being
bedazzled
by
ideas
who
have
quality
will
outgrow
the
experience
the
rest
will
turn
beat
or
into
dentists
or
into
beat
dentists
the
sad
truth
is
that
while
one
might
write
well
without
having
read
one
is
more
likely
to
write
well
if
one
has
read
it
and
much
else
most
appalling
aspect
of
piece
is
his
reflection
of
the
beat
aesthetic
mentions
the
beats
only
once
when
he
refers
to
their
having
revived
through
mere
power
and
abandonment
and
the
unwillingness
to
commit
death
in
life
some
idea
of
a
decent
equivalent
between
verbal
expression
and
actual
experience
but
the
entire
narrative
is
written
in
the
tiresome
vocabulary
of
that
lost
and
dying
cause
and
in
the
sprung
syntax
that
is
supposed
to
supplant
our
mother
tongue
aesthetic
combines
conscious
and
unconscious
naivete
and
a
winsome
reliance
upon
the
natural
and
upon
experience
are
the
thruway
to
nowhere
touchstones
had
been
strictly
literature
and
humanly
enough
literature
because
that
was
what
wanted
to

once
in

the
best
novelist

all

a
small
masterpiece

new
novel
a
big
one
one
that
people
had
been
waiting
for
was
going
to
be
hard
going
all
the
way
because
he
written
seriously
for
a
while
except
for
a
few
stories
was
tired
of
the
old
method
of

he
had
so
successfully
used

lady
said
she
had
to
go

of

in

walk
in

there
is
a
glowing
view
of
the
whole
city
in
that
park
are
the
rows
of
marble
busts
of
fallen
men
the
ones
who
one
day
rushed
out

under
fire
all
the

up
the
long
straight
narrow
lane

that
was
the
end

that
time
on
out
of
the

they
had
charged
straight
up

walked
it
many
times
and
shivered
figuring
what
a

had
been

filled
with

awful

glorious

a
huge
sculptor
who
had
been
a
rifleman
all
across

it
was
stupid
butchery
to
order
men
to
make
a
charge
like
that
no
matter
who
gave
the
order
and
what
for
it
would
be
butchery
all
right
the
said

see
it
that
way

it
was
glorious

was

really
wanted
to
put
a
wreath
on
the
monument
on
the
of
had
her
reasons
for
this
one
thing
there
going
to
be
any
ceremony
at
all
this
year
were
a
few
reasons
for
that
too
had
been
taken
up
and
exploited
by
the
nowadays
the
government
wanted
no
part
of
him
is
sort
of
as
if
our
government
should
decide
to
disown
or
for
the
same
reason
then
there
were
ecclesiastical
matters
the
matter
of
was
a
new
and
the
was
making
itself
heard
and
felt
these
days
it
happens
the
lady
is
a
good
herself
but
of
more
liberal
political
persuasion
was
going
to
be
done
this
year
to
celebrate
bold
and
unsuccessful
defense
of
that
the
lady
wanted
to
do
was
to
walk
up
to
the
monument
and
lay
a
wreath
at
its
base
would
show
that
somebody
even
a
foreigner
living
in
cared
then
there
were
other
things
of
the
marble
busts
in
the
park

of
young
who
fought
and
died
for

for
me
to

the

never
heard
of
again

thought
either
to
have
been
killed
by
the
as
soon
as
he
landed
or
to
have
killed
himself
by
flying
out
to
sea
and
crashing
his
plane
was
thus
an
early
and
spectacular
victim
there
is
something
so
wonderfully
romantic
about
it
all
really
know
how
to
fly
had
crashed
on
takeoff
once
before
had
it
for
gossip
is
the
soul
of
that
a
famous

of
the
time
had
paid
for
both
the

absurd
and
dramatic
is
remembered
and
has
been
commemorated
by
a
bust
in
a
park
and
a
square
in

was
renamed
after
the
war
even
some
postmen
know
it
by
the
old
name
with
a
gesture
like

usually
that
my
sentiments
are
closer
to
those
of
my
sculptor
friend
things
that
happened
in
police
station
basements
were
dirty
grubby
and
most
often
anonymous
poetry
no
airplanes
no
dancers
is
how
the
real
routine
of
resistance
goes
on
and
its
strength
is
directly
proportionate
to
the
number
of
insignificant
people
who
can
let
themselves
be
taken
to
pieces
piece
by
piece
without
quitting
is
an
ugly
business
and
there
are
few
if
any
wreaths
for
them
keep
thinking
of
a
young
woman
knew
during
the

been
picked
up

escaped
crawled
through
the
usual
mine
fields
under
barbed
wire
was
shot
at
swam
a
river
and
we
finally
picked
her
up
in
showed
us
what
had
happened
to
her

no
statements
no
spot
not
even
a
dimesize
spot
on
her
whole

very
well

how
his
action

trouble
is
that
like
many
symbols
it
seem
a
very
realistic
one
lady
wanted
to
pay
tribute
to
and
to
but
she
going
to
be
here
to
do
it
any
of
us
interested
enough
in
the
idea
to
do
it
for
her
by
proxy
so
to
speak
was
a
pretty
thorough
silence
at
that
point

stirring
coffee
banging
against
the
side
of
the
cup
sounded
as
loud
as
a
bell
thought
the
hell
not

do
it
for
her

some
reasons
too
admire
the
lady
hate
embarrassing
silences

have
been
known
to
make
a
fool
out
of
myself
just
to
prevent

prove
to
myself
that

not
afraid
of

much
for
all
that
lady
was
pleased
and
enthusiastic
gave
me
the
names
of
some
people
who
would
surely
help
pay
for

we

on
a
substantial
and
sustained
scale
the

the

application
of

cannot
of

be

must
be
recognized
that
countries
at
different
stages
of

have
very
different
capabilities
of
meeting
such
conditions
insist
on
a
level
of
performance
in
programing
and
budgeting
completely
beyond
the
capabilities
of
the
recipient
country
would
result
in
the
frustration
of
the
basic
objective
of
our
development
assistance
to
encourage
more
rapid
growth
the
more
primitive
areas
where
the
capacity
to
absorb
and
utilize
external
assistance
is
limited
some
activities
may
be
of
such
obvious
priority
that
we
may
decide
to
support
them
before
a
well
worked
out
program
is
available
we
might
provide
limited
assistance
in
such
fields
as
education
essential
transport
communications
and
agricultural
improvement
despite
the
absence
of
acceptable
country
programs
such
a
case
however
we
would
encourage
the
recipient
country
to
get
on
with
its
programing
task
supply
it
with
substantial
technical
assistance
in
performing
that
task
and
make
it
plain
that
an
expansion
or
even
a
continuation
of
our
assistance
to
the
development
was
conditional
upon
programing
progress
being
made
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
where
the
more
advanced
countries
can
be
relied
upon
to
make
well
thought
through
decisions
as
to
project
priorities
within
a
consistent
program
we
should
be
prepared
to
depart
substantially
from
detailed
project
approval
as
the
basis
for
granting
assistance
and
to
move
toward
support
in
cooperation
with
other
developed
countries
of
the
essential
foreign
exchange
requirements
of
the
development
program
reasons
for
stressing
systematic
approach
to
development
budgeting
and
programing
is
one
important
kind
of
are
many
others
is
vitally
important
that
the
new
aid
program
should
encourage
all
of
them
since
the
main
thrust
for
development
must
come
from
the
less
developed
countries
themselves
aid
can
only
be
marginal
although
the
margin
as
in
the
case
of
the
plan
can
be
decisive
aid
can
be
effective
only
if
it
is
a
complement
to
aid
therefore
should
increasingly
be
designed
to
provide
incentives
for
countries
to
take
the
steps
that
only
they
themselves
can
take
advice
is
not
interference
establishing
conditions
of
it
is
important
that
we
not
expect
countries
to
remake
themselves
in
our
image
societies
can
take
many
forms
and
within
very
broad
limits
recipients
must
be
free
to
set
their
own
goals
and
to
devise
their
own
institutions
to
achieve
those
goals
the
other
hand
it
is
no
interference
with
sovereignty
to
point
out
defects
where
they
exist
such
as
that
a
plan
calls
for
factories
without
power
to
run
them
or
for
institutions
without
trained
personnel
to
staff
them
we
have
made
clear
that
we
are
genuinely
concerned
with
a
development
potential
we
can
be
blunt
in
suggesting
the
technical
conditions
that
must
be
met
for
development
to
occur
range
of
major
areas
of
are
the
following
the
effective
mobilizing
of
resources
includes
not
only
development
programing
but
also
establishing
tax
policies
designed
to
raise
equitably
resources
for
investment
fiscal
and
monetary
policies
designed
to
prevent
serious
inflation
and
regulatory
policies
aimed
to
attract
the
financial
and
managerial
resources
of
foreign
investment
and
to
prevent
excessive
luxury
consumption
by
a
few
the
reduction
of
dependence
on
external
sources
includes
foreseeing
crises
with
adequate
attention
to
reducing
dependence
on
imports
and
adopting
realistic
exchange
rates
to
encourage
infant
industries
and
spur
exports
also
includes
providing
for
the
training
of
nationals
to
operate
projects
after
they
are
completed
tapping
the
energies
of
the
entire
population
both
economic
and
political
reasons
all
segments
of
the
population
must
be
able
to
share
in
the
growth
of
a
country
development
will
not
lead
to
longrun
stability
honesty
in
government
many
societies
what
we
regard
as
corruption
favoritism
and
personal
influence
are
so
accepted
as
consistent
with
the
mores
of
officialdom
and
so
integral
a
part
of
routine
administrative
practice
that
any
attempt
to
force
their
elimination
will
be
regarded
by
the
local
leadership
as
not
only
unwarranted
but
unfriendly
an
economy
cannot
get
the
most
out
of
its
resources
if
dishonesty
corruption
and
favoritism
are
widespread
tolerance
by
us
of
such
practices
results
in
serious
waste
and
diversion
of
aid
resources
and
in
the
long
run
generates
sentiment
of
a
kind
peculiarly
damaging
to
our
political
interest
of
the
most
dramatic
successes
of
in
winning
local
support
can
be
traced
to
the
identification
correct
or
not
of
regimes
with
personal
honesty
and
regimes
with
corruption
requirement
of
reasonably
honest
administration
may
be
politically
uncomfortable
in
the
short
run
but
it
is
politically
essential
in
the
long
run
position
on

use
its
aid
as
an
incentive

responding
with
aid
on
a
sustained
basis
tailored
to
priority
needs
to
those
countries
making
serious
efforts
in
many
instances
it
can
withhold
or
limit
its
aid
to
countries
not
yet
willing
to
make
such
efforts
are
other
countries
where
with
skillful
diplomacy
we
may
be
able
by
our
aid
to
give
encouragement
to
those
groups
in
government
which
would
like
to
press
forward
with
economic
and
social
reform
measures
to
promote
growth
are
rarely
monolithic
there
will
be
still
other
countries
where
despite
the
inadequacy
of
the
level
of
we
shall
deem
it
wise
for
political
or
military
reasons
to
give
substantial
economic
assistance
in
these
cases
we
should
promote
by
making
it
clear
that
our
supporting
assistance
is
subject
to
reduction
and
ultimately
to
termination
a
approach
requires
a
approach
most
fundamental
concept
of
the
new
approach
to
economic
aid
is
the
focusing
of
our
attention
our
resources
and
our
energies
on
the
effort
to
promote
the
economic
and
social
development
of
the
less
developed
countries
is
not
a
goal
have
any
success
in
this
effort
we
must
ourselves
view
it
as
an
enterprise
stretching
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
and
we
must
encourage
the
recipients
of
our
aid
to
view
it
in
the
same
fashion
of
our
aid
will
go
to
those
nearing
long
it
will
take
to
show
substantial
success
in
this
effort
will
vary
greatly
from
country
to
country
several
significant
cases
such
as
a
decade
of
concentrated
effort
can
launch
these
countries
into
a
stage
in
which
they
can
carry
forward
their
own
economic
and
social
progress
with
little
or
no
assistance
cases
in
which
light
is
already
visible
at
the
other
end
of
the
tunnel
are
ones
which
over
the
next
few
years
will
absorb
the
bulk
of
our
capital
assistance
others
will
move
up
to
the
same
level
number
of
countries
thus
favorably
situated
is
small
but
their
peoples
constitute
over
half
of
the
population
of
the
underdeveloped
world
over
the
decade
of
the
sixties
we
can
hope
that
many
other
countries
will
ready
themselves
for
the
big
push
into
growth
still
others
which
are
barely
on
the
threshold
of
the
transition
into
modernity
the
decade
can
bring
significant
progress
in
launching
the
slow
process
of
developing
their
human
resources
and
their
basic
services
to
the
point
where
an
expanded
range
of
developmental
activities
is
possible
is
a
process
whole
program
must
be
conceived
of
as
an
effort
stretching
over
a
considerable
number
of
years
to
alter
the
basic
social
and
economic
conditions
in
the
less
developed
world
must
be
recognized
as
a
tool
designed
to
prevent
political
and
military
crises
such
as
those
recently
confronted
in
and
is
not
a
tool
for
dealing
with
these
crises
after
they
have
erupted
specific
reasons
for
a
approach
the
need
to
budget
a
period
of

the
individual

which

is
required

over

or
even

by

the

made
in
that
year
capital
expansion
programs
of
business
firms
involve

and
the
same
is
true
of
country
development
programs
the
need
to
plan
investment
programs
importantly
several
of
the
more
advanced
of
the
less
developed
countries
have
found
through
experience
that
they
must
plan
their
own
complex
investment
programs
for
at
least
years
forward
and
tentatively
for
considerably
more
than
that
if
they
are
to
be
sure
that
the
various
interdependent
activities
involved
are
all
to
take
place
in
the
proper
sequence
such
forward
planning
investment
funds
are
wasted
because
manufacturing
facilities
are
completed
before
there
is
power
to
operate
them
or
before
there
is
transport
to
service
them
or
a
skilled
labor
force
is
trained
before
there
are
plants
available
in
which
they
can
be
employed
the
need
to
allocate
country
resources
important
of
all
the
less
developed
countries
must
be
persuaded
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
allocate

their
own

be
induced
to
establish
the
necessary
tax
fiscal
monetary
and
regulatory
policies
must
be
persuaded
to
adopt
the
other
necessary
measures
which
are
described
in
the
preceding
section
taking
of
these
steps
involves
tough
internal
policy
decisions
once
these
steps
are
taken
they
may
require
years
to
make
themselves
felt

therefore
be
related
to

incentive
the
less

are
to
be

to
adopt
a
approach
the
as
the
principal
supplier
of

must
be
prepared
to
give
commitments
this
as
in
so
many
aspects
of
our
development
assistance
activities
the
incentive
effects
of
the
posture
we
take
are
the
most
important
ones
extent
to
which
we
can
persuade
the
less
developed
countries
to
appraise
their
own
resources
to
set
targets
toward
which
they
should
be
working
to
establish
in
the
light
of
this
forward
perspective
the
most
urgent
priorities
for
their
immediate
attention
and
to
do
the
other
things
which
they
must
do
to
help
themselves
all
on
a
realistic
basis
will
depend
importantly
on
the
incentives
we
place
before
them
they
feel
that
we
are
taking
a
view
of
their
problems
and
are
prepared
to
enter
into
reasonably
association
with
them
in
their
development
activities
they
will
be
much
more
likely
to
undertake
the
difficult
tasks
required
the
most
important
incentive
for
them
will
be
clear
evidence
that
where
other
countries
have
done
this
kind
of
home
work
we
have
responded
with
commitments
have
heard

tell
these

and
come

go
and
that
we
are
passing
on
to
them
the
freest
that
mankind
has
ever
known
have
seen
the
pride
of
country
well
in

of
these
young

say
bless
you
and
keep
you
for
many
years
not
only
for
this

but
for
the
of

the

remember
the
words
of

when
someone
asked

he
said

it
leave
to

ask
unanimous
consent
that
all
who
desire
to
do
so
may
extend
their
remarks
at
this

in

also
that

objection
to
the

of
the

from

no
objection
of
of
is
notably
significant
that
so
many
from
both
sides
of
the
aisle
express
their
respect
and
admiration
for
our
beloved
the
purposely
refrained
from
adding
the
usual
distinction
of
saying
that
he
was
from
the
of
did
so
because
agree
with
so
many
here
today
that
he
is
the
beloved
of
all
the
people
of
the
the
dignity
the
influence
and
the
power
of
the
legislative
branch
of
our
it
is
a
privilege
for
us
to
do
honor
to
this
great
man
who
represents
not
alone
his
own
district
but
all
the
people
of
our
country
honor
him
is
to
honor
ourselves
this
my
first
year
as
a
of
this
body
have
experienced
many
memorable
moments
of
these
experiences
are
so
important
that
they
will
be
cherished
forever
by
me
like
many
of
you
here
present
hold
as
the
highlight
of
all
the
occasion
of
my
first
meeting
with
the
honorable
of
the
that
time
he
afforded
me
the
courtesy
of
his
busy
workday
for
such
length
as
may
need
to
speak
about
my
background
my
hopes
my
views
on
various
national
and
local
topics
and
any
problems
that
may
have
been
vexed
with
at
the
time
was
fatherly
in
his
handling
of
all
subjects
with
me
and
tremendously
wise
in
his
counsel
conclusion
he
wished
me
well
and
as
kindly
and
humbly
as
this
humane
gentleman
could
express
himself
he
asked
to
be
remembered
to
my
wife
and
children
my
short
period
here
believe
that
at
no
time
has
he
been
otherwise
than
the
most
popular
man
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
is
most
effective
in
the
ordinary
business
of
the
and
in
the
legislative
accomplishments
of
this
session
he
easily
rose
to
great
occasion
even
at
the
height
of
unpleasantness
and
exciting
legislative
struggle
and
as
the
witnessed
these
contests
he
rose
even
as
admitted
by
those
who
differed
with
him
to
the
proportions
of
a
hero
and
a
noble
partisan
am
highly
privileged
today
to
commemorate
the
brilliant
career
of
this
parliamentary
giant
will
ever
be
my
example
as
a
true
statesman
one
who
is
thoroughly
human
who
affects
no
dignity
and
who
is
endowed
with
real
ability
genuine
worth
and
sterling
honesty
all
dedicated
to
secure
the
best
interests
of
the
country
he
has
loved
and
served
so
long
the
in
bless
this
country
with
continued
service
here
for
years
to
come
of
of
is
a
matter
of
deep
personal
satisfaction
for
me
to
add
my
voice
to
the
great
and
distinguished
chorus
of
my
colleagues
in
this
paean
of
praise
respect
and
affection
for
this
hour
of
crisis
the
wisdom
the
dedication
the
stabilizing
force
that
he
represents
in
current
government
is
an
almost
indispensable
source
of
strength
has
become
in
this
half
century
the
grand
old
man
of
history
seems
to
me
that
the
prayers
of
the
whole
free
world
must
rise
like
some
vast
petition
to
that
vigor
and
his
life
remain
undiminished
through
the
coming
decades
briefly
in
this
humble
tribute
have
sought
for
some
simple
and
succinct
summation
that
would
define
the
immense
service
of
this
patriot
to
his
country
the
task
is
beyond
me
because
hold
it
impossible
to
compress
in
a
sentence
or
two
the
complicated
and
prodigious
contributions
has
made
as
an
individual
as
a
legislator
as
a
statesman
and
as
a
leader
and
conciliator
to
the
majestic
progress
of
this
happens
that
am
a
legislator
from
and
that
feel
deeply
about
the
needs
the
aspirations
the
interests
of
my
district
and
my
life
proves
to
us
all
is
the
magnificent
lesson
in
political
science
that
one
can
devotedly
and
with
absolute
dedication
represent
the
seemingly
provincial
interests
of
own
community
own
district
own
and
by
that
help
himself
represent
even
better
the
sweep
and
scope
of
the
problems
of
this
the
greatest
nation
of
all
time
never
forgot
his
home
community
and
he
never
forgot
the
same
way
like
to
think
we
owe
our
loyalty
as
legislators
to
our
community
our
district
our
if
we
follow
the
pattern
as
consciously
or
by
an
instinctual
political
sense
like
to
think
have
followed
it
then
the
very
nature
of
our
loyalty
to
our
own
immediate
areas
must
necessarily
be
reflected
in
the
devotion
of
our
services
to
our
country
what
life
in
this
teaches
us
is
that
loyalty
and
character
are
not
divisive
and
there
is
no
such
thing
as
being
for
your
country
and
neglecting
your
district
is
no
such
thing
as
being
diligent
about
national
affairs
but
indifferent
about
home
needs
two
are
as
one
may
not
be
the
greatest
but
it
certainly
comes
close
to
being
the
greatest
lesson
career
up
to
this
hour
teaches
all
of
us
who
would
aspire
to
distinction
in
political
life
under
our
processes
of
government
than
that
is
the
very
living
symbol
of
an
integrity
so
powerful
in
his
nature
and
so
constantly
demonstrated
that
he
can
count
some
of
his
best
friends
in
the
opposition
the
most
rancorous
battles
of
political
controversy
and
the
most
bitterly
fought
national
and
presidential
campaigns
his
character
shines
as
an
example
of
dignity
and
honesty
forthrightness
and
nobility
has
never
had
to
look
back
at
any
of
his
most
devastating
fights
and
ever
feel
ashamed
of
his
conduct
as
a
combatant
under
fire
or
his
political
manners
in
the
heat
of
conflicting
ambitions
means
much
to
the
tradition
is
an
answer
in
its
way
individual
and
highly
dramatic
to
the
charge
that
the
democratic
process
is
necessarily
vicious
in
its
campaign
characteristics
the
name
is
one
of
the
most
dominant
in
the
history
of
politics
for
the
last
half
century
is
insist
hard
to
define
the
contribution
to
our
political
civilization
because
it
is
so
massive
and
so
widespread
and
so
complicated
and
because
it
goes
so
deep
this
we
know
is
a
great
life
that
in
every
area
of
politics
gives
the
people
occasion
for
pride
and
that
has
invested
the
democratic
process
with
the
most
decent
qualities
of
honor
decency
and
pray
to
that
he
may
be
spared
to
us
for
many
years
to
come
for
this
is
an
influence
the
and
the
whole
world
can
ill
afford
to
lose
of
of
but
two
of
my
nine
terms
in
the
of
has
been
served
under
the
of
this
am
proud
have
a
distinct
admiration
for
this
man
we
honor
today
because
of
the
humility
with
which
he
carries
his
greatness
is
a
great
man
one
who
will
go
down
in
history
as
a
truly
great
leader
of
the
will
be
considered
not
only
great
among
his
contemporaries
but
as
great
among
all
the
who
have
played
a
part
in
the
history
since
the
beginning
pay
my
personal
tribute
to
stalwart
and
great
not
only
because
today
he
establishes
a
record
of
having
served
as
of
the
of
more
than
twice
as
long
as
but
because
of
the
contributions
he
has
made
to
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
during
his
almost
half
century
of
service
as
a
of
has
not
limited
his
leadership
as
a
statesman
to
his
direction
of
the

the
chair
had
an
outstanding
record
as
a
legislator
since
the
start
of
his
career
in
the
in
the
one
has
sponsored
more
progressive
and
important
legislation
than
has
is
the
recognized
father
of
the
and
the
and
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
programs
brought
into
being
through
his
legislative
efforts
would
fill
the
pages
of
greater
pleasure
has
come
to
me
in
my
own
service
in
this
than
to
be
present
today
to
participate
in
this
tribute
to
this
great
this
great
legislator
this
great
this
great
sincere
wish
is
that
he
continues
to
add
to
this
record
he
sets
here
today
of
of

one
of
the
greatest
public
figures
in
the
history
of
our
country
and
consider
that
have
been
singly
honored
in
the
privilege
of
knowing
and
sharing
with
him
the
rights
and
obligations
of
a
of
the
of

the
of
the
may
speak
of
uniquely
long
and
devoted
service
of
his
championship
of
many
of
the
progressive
social
measures
which
adorn
our
statute
books
today
and
of
his
cooperation
in
times
of
adversity
with
of
both
of
our
major
parties
in
helping
to
pilot
the

the
shoals

to
speak
however
of
the
person

than
the
institution

a
gruff
exterior
in
many
instances
nevertheless
he
is
fundamentally
a
man
of
warm
heart
and
gentle
disposition
one
could
be
more
devoted
than
he
to
the
as
an
institution
and
more
aware
of
its
historical
significance
in
the
political
history
of
the
world
and
shall
never
forget
his
moving
talks
delivered
in
simple
yet
eloquent
words
upon
the
meaning
of
our
jobs
as
in
the
operation
of
representative
government

their
importance

upon

a
fledgling
can

inevitably
confront

he
has
always
been
most
characteristic
and
most
helpful

have
served
as
twice
as

as
any
predecessor

several
points
for

with
practices
states
assign
or
provide
vehicles
for
employees
on
state
business
other
states
provide
vehicles
but
only
with
legislative
approval
which
provide
automobiles

variously
to
the
agency
the

states

allocation
maintenance
of
vehicles
states
report
laws
policies
or
regulations
for
assigning
state
vehicles
in
lieu
of
paying
mileage
allowances
these
states
the
average
point
at
which
a
car
is
substituted
for
allowances
is
miles
per
year
allowances
allowances
for

of
two
types
actual

not
overly
restrictive
monthly

are
a
controversial
subject
have
a
great
advantage
in
ease
of
audit
time
and
payment
they
lend
themselves
to
abuse
and
inadequate

measures
payments

are
more
expensive
to
the

allowances

have
been
revised
by
administrative
officials
recently
and
compare
favorably
with
other
allowances
few
exceptions
travelers
on
state

are
allowed
actual
travel
expenses
and
per

subsistence
allowances
are
and
pose
little
problem
in
administration
audit
control
of
state
automobile
practices
general
background
is
difficult
to
pinpoint
the
time
of
origin
of
the
state
purchasing
automobiles
for
use
of
employees
in
records
are
available
concerning
the
subject
prior
to
that
are
available
shed
little
light
of
indicates
that
at
least
one
state
automobile
was
registered
as
far
back
as
should
be
enough
to
say
that
the
practice
of
the
state
buying
automobiles
is
at
least
forty
years
old
best
reason
that
can
be
advanced
for
the
state
adopting
the
practice
was
the
advent
of
expanded
highway
construction
during
the
and
that
time
highway
engineers
traveled
rough
and
dirty
roads
to
accomplish
their
duties
vehicles
was
a
personal
hardship
for
such
employees
and
the
matter
of
providing
state
transportation
was
felt
perfectly
justifiable
the
principle
was
established
the
increase
in
vehicles
came
rapidly
reasons
other
than
employee
need
contributed
to
the
growth
immediately
below
shows
the
rate
of
growth
of
vehicles
and
employees
rate
of
increase
does
not
signify
anything
in
itself
does
not
indicate
loose
management
ineffective
controls
or
poor
policy
it
does
show
that
automobiles
have
increased
steadily
over
the
years
and
in
almost
the
same
proportion
to
the
increase
of
state
employees
the
past
twenty
years
the
ratio
of
automobiles
per
state
employees
has
varied
from
to
then
to
to
now
there
were
too
few
automobiles
in
or
too
many
now
is
problematical
fact
is
simply
that
vehicles
have
remained
in
practically
the
same
proportion
as
employees
to
use
them
and
operation
of
the
motor
pool
the
origin
of
automobiles
may
be
obscured
subsequent
developments
concerning
the
assignment
use
and
management
of
state
automobiles
can
be
related
more
clearly
to
automobiles
were
the
individual
responsibility
of
the
agency
to
which
assigned
responsibility
included
all
phases
of
management
embraced
determining
when
to
purchase
and
when
to
trade
vehicles
who
was
to
drive
when
and
where
repairs
were
to
be
made
where
gasoline
and
automobile
services
were
to
be
obtained
and
other
allied
matters
however
the
nation
was
at
war
and
automobile
tires
were
rationed
commodities
state
was
confronted
with
transportation
problems
similar
to
those
of
the
individual
met
these
problems
by
the
creation
of
the
state
automobile
maintenance
unit
more
popularly
called
the
motor
pool
a
centralized
operation
for
the
maintenance
and
control
of
all
state
transportation
motor
pool
then
as
now
had
headquarter
facilities
in
and
other
garages
located
throughout
the
state
was
organizationally
the
responsibility
of
the
of
and
was
financed
on
a
rotary
fund
basis
with
each
agency
of
government
contributing
to
the
operation
the
operation
was
transferred
to
the
of
an
agency
established
as
the
central
staff
and
auxiliary
department
of
the
state
government
management
of
vehicles
since
that
time
has
been
described
in
a
recent
report
in
the
following
manner
this
new
management
considerable
progress
appears
to
have
been
made
agencies
of
government
are
now
billed
for
the
actual
cost
of
services
provided
to
each
passenger
car
rather
than
the
prior
uniform
charge
for
all
cars
the
maintenance
rotary
fund
had
in
the
past
sustained
losses
considerably
beyond
expectations
the
introduction
of
the
system
plus
other
control
refinements
has
resulted
in
keeping
the
fund
on
a
proper
working
basis
indication
of
the
merits
of
the
new
management
is
found
in
the
fact
that
during
the
period
while
total
annual
mileage
put
on
the
vehicles
increased
the
total
maintenance
cost
increased
only
order
to
further
refine
the
management
of
passenger
vehicles
on
the
actual
title
to
every
vehicle
was
transferred
by
to
the
of
and
objective
behind
this
action
was
to
place
in
one
agency
the
responsibility
for
the
management
assignment
and
replacement
of
all
vehicles
far
as
cars
are
concerned
only
their
replacement
is
under
this
division
tied
in
closely
with
the
current
attempt
to
upgrade
cars
to
the
extent
that
vehicles
are
not
retained
beyond
the
point
where
maintenance
costs
in
light
of
depreciation
become
excessive
it
allows
the
present
management
to
reassign
vehicles
so
that
mileage
will
be
more
uniformly
distributed
throughout
the
fleet
for
example
if
one
driver
puts
on
miles
per
year
and
another
driver
miles
per
year
their
cars
will
be
switched
so
that
both
cars
will
have
miles
after
two
years
rather
than
miles
and
related
higher
maintenance
costs
and
miles
respectively
motor
pool
is
a
completely
centralized
and
mechanized
operation
handles
all
types
of
vehicle
maintenance
but
concentrates
more
on
service
station
activities
than
on
extensive
vehicle
repairs
contracts
with
outside

garages
for
much
of
the
latter
work
the

excels
is
in
its
compilation
of
maintenance
and
studies
and
analyses

reveal
in
detail
the

per

and

per
gallon
of

or
three
years
the
periods
when

costs
become
excessive
and
when

should
be
traded
for
sound
economies
this
motor
pool
personnel
develop
other
meaningful
and
related
data
vehicles
averaged
an
operating
cost
of
per
mile
on
this
figure
and
considering
depreciation
costs
of
vehicles
pool
personnel
have
determined
that
travel
in
excess
of
miles
annually
is
more
economical
by
state
car
than
by
payment
of
allowances
for
use
of
vehicles
estimate
further
that
with
sufficient
experience
and
when
of

is
compiled
the
point
may
be
reduced
to
miles

year
shows
operating
cost
data
of
state
vehicles
selected
at
random
matter
of
concern
to
the
complete
effectiveness
of
pool
operations
is
the
lack
of
adequate
central
garage
facilities
pool

at
two
locations
in
are
crowded
antiquated
and
in
general
make
for
inefficient
operation
in
terms
of
dispersement
of

and
duplication
of
such
operational
needs
as
stock
and
repair
equipment
facilities
would
be
a
decided
help
to
pool
operations
and
probably
reduce
vehicle
costs
even
more
practices
purchase
of
vehicles
is
handled
in
the
same
manner
as
all
other
purchases
of
the
state
are
made
by

with
any
necessary

the

are
made
to
the
lowest
responsible
bidders
prices
for
state
vehicles
are
invariably
lower
than
to
the
general
public
reasons
are
obvious
the
state
is
buying
in
quantity
and
it
has
no
federal
excise
or
state
sales
tax
to
pay
the
state
was
also
entitled
to
a
special
type
of
discount
through
the
dealers
that
ownership
of
all
vehicles
rests
with
the
state
motor
pool
cars

but
transferred

earlier

a
normal
governmental
procedure
which

assignment
and

of

is
another
matter
to
be
covered
in
detail
later
purchase
assignment
and

policies
the
most
important
of
all
matters
for
review
are
the
broad
administrative
policies
governing
the
purchase
assignment
use
and
management
of
state
vehicles
role
in
policy
determination
in
this
area
for
years
has
been
confined
almost
solely
to
the
amount
of
funds
appropriated
annually
for
the
purchase
and
operation
of
vehicles
more
meaningful
policies
have
been
left
to
the
judgment
of
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
state
the
of
property
tax
was
a
time
some
years
ago
when
local
taxation
by
the
cities
and
towns
was
sufficient
to
support
their
own
operations
and
a
part
of
the
cost
of
the
state
government
as
well
many
years
a
state
tax
on
cities
and
towns
was
paid
by
the
several
municipalities
to
the
state
from
the
proceeds
of
the
general
property
tax
tax
was
discontinued
in
that
time
the
demands
of
the
citizens
for
new
and
expanded
services
have
placed
financial
burdens
on
the
state
which
could
not
have
been
foreseen
in
earlier
years
the
same
time
there
has
been
an
upgrading
and
expansion
of
municipal
services
as
well
there
has
come
into
being
a
situation
in
which
the
state
must
raise
all
of
its
own
revenues
and
in
addition
must
give
assistance
to
its
local
governments
financial
assistance
from
the
state
has
become
necessary
because
the
local
governments
themselves
found
the
property
tax
or
at
least
at
the
rates
then
existing
insufficient
for
their
requirements
there
have
developed
several
forms
of
and
shared
taxes
as
well
as
the
unrestricted
grant
to
local
governments
for
general
purposes
whose
adoption
accompanied
the
introduction
of
a
sales
tax
at
the
state
level
state
aid
the
local
governments
are
continuing
to
seek
additional
revenue
of
their
own
by
strengthening
the
property
tax
is
being
done
both
by
the
revaluation
of
real
property
and
by
seeking
out
forms
of
personal
property
hitherto
neglected
or
ignored
of
tangible
movable
property
in
has
been
generally
of
a
hands
off
nature
due
possibly
to
several
reasons
local
assessors
in
the
main
are
not
well
paid
and
have
inadequate
office
staffs
the
numerous
categories
of
this
component
of
personal
property
make
locating
extremely
difficult
and
the
inexperience
of
the
majority
of
assessors
in
evaluating
this
type
of
property
of
taxing
personal
property
the
many
problems
in
the
taxing
of
personal
property
and
of
movable
tangible
property
in
particular
two
are
significant
situs
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
problems
are
not
local
to
but
are
recognized
as
common
to
all
states
of
property
the
laws
of
the
various
states
in
general
specify
the
situs
of
property
residence
or
domicile
of
the
owner
or
location
of
the
property
the
exceptions
regarding
boats
airplanes
mobile
homes
seem
to
add
to
the
uncertainty
of
the
proper
origination
point
for
assessment
law
specifies
that
all
real
estate
is
taxable
in
the
town
in
which
it
is
situated
also
provides
for
the
taxation
of
all
personal
property
belonging
to
inhabitants
of
the
state
both
tangible
and
intangible
and
the
tangible
personal
property
of
in
this
state
defining
personal
property
it
specifically
mentions
all
ships
or
vessels
at
home
or
abroad
property
is
taxable
wherever
the
owner
has
a
place
of
abode
the
greater
portion
of
the
year
a
similar
situs
for
tangible
property
is
mentioned
in
the
statute
this
is
cancelled
out
by
the
provision
that
definite
kinds
of
property
and
all
other
tangible
property
situated
or
being
in
any
town
is
taxable
where
the
property
is
situated
would
seem
to
fix
the
tax
situs
of
all
movable
personal
property
at
its
location
on
boats
and
aircraft
would
fall
within
this
category
as
well
as
motor
vehicles
location
of
the
latter
now
is
determined
for
tax
purposes
at
the
time
of
registration
and
it
is
now
accepted
practice
to
consider
a
motor
vehicle
as
being
situated
where
it
is
garaged
it
would
be
impossible
to
determine
where
every
vehicle
might
be
on
the
day
of
view
of
the
acceptance
accorded
the
status
of
motor
vehicles
for
tax
purposes
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
provision
it
would
seem
entirely
consistent
to
apply
the
same
interpretation
to
boats
or
aircraft
recent
example
of
this
problem
is
the
flying
of
six
airplanes
on
from
the
in
to
the
in
situation
resulted
in
both
towns
claiming
the
tax
and
probably
justifiably
bases
its
claim
on
the
general
provision
of
the
law
that
all
rateable
property
both
tangible
and
intangible
shall
be
taxed
to
the
owner
thereof
in
the
town
in
which
such
owner
shall
have
had
his
actual
place
of
abode
for
the
larger
portion
of
the
twelve
months
next
preceding
the
first
day
of
in
each
year
tax
assessor
in
turn
claims
the
tax
under
the
provision
of
law
and
all
other
tangible
personal
property
situated
or
being
in
any
town
in
or
upon
any
place
of
storage
shall
be
taxed
to
such
person
in
the
town
where
said
property
is
situated
of
value
problem
of
fair
and
equitable
assessment
of
value
is
a
difficult
one
to
solve
in
that
the
determination
of
fair
valuation
is
dependent
on
local
assessors
who
in
general
are
and
personnel
taking
an
individualistic
approach
to
the
problem
accounts
for
the
wide
variance
in
assessment
practices
of
movable
tangible
property
in
the
various
municipalities
in
condition
will
undoubtedly
continue
until
such
time
as
a
state
uniform
system
of
evaluation
is
established
or
through
mutual
agreement
of
the
local
assessing
officials
for
a
method
of
standard
assessment
practice
to
be
adopted
in
its
publication
once
commented
most
realistic
way
of
facing
up
to
this
problem
would
be
to
have
the
take
over
full
responsibility
for
assessing
all
taxable
property
adequately
staffed
and
equipped
assessing
office
could
apply
uniform
methods
and
standards
which
would
go
far
toward
producing
equitable
assessments
on
all
properties
throughout
the
single
statewide
assessing
unit
would
eliminate
the
differences
and
complications
that
are
inherent
in
a
system
of
different
and
independent
assessing
units
of
in
its
report
to
the
in
recommended
consolidating
and
centralizing
all
aspects
of
property
tax
administration
in
a
single
state
agency
professionally
organized
and
equipped
for
the
job
resulting
setup
it
was
declared
would
be
similar
to
that
which
is
in
successful
operation
in
a
number
of
metropolitan
counties
as
large
or
larger
than
in
determine
the
practice
and
attitude
of
municipal
governments
concerning
tangible
movable
property
a
questionnaire
was
sent
to
all
local
government
assessors
or
boards
of
assessors
in
replies
from
each
individual
town
are
not
given
in
detail
because
the
questions
asked
the
personal
opinion
of
the
several
assessors
and
are
not
necessarily
the
established
policy
of
the
town
in
each
case
are
legitimate
reasons
for
differences
of
opinion
among
the
assessors
as
a
whole
and
among
the
public
officials
in
each
town
opinions
of
the
assessors
are
of
significance
in
indicating
what
their
thinking
seems
to
be
at
the
present
time
reply
to
a
question
of
whether
they
now
tax
boats
airplanes
and
other
movable
property
excluding
automobiles
nineteen
said
that
they
did
and
twenty
that
they
did
not
wording
of
the
question
was
quite
general
and
may
have
been
subject
to
different
interpretations
assessor
checked
boats
only
another
trailers
and
tractors
one
mentioned
house
trailers
and
two
others
referred
to
trailers
without
specifying
the
type
two
cases
airplanes
only
were
indicated
is
difficult
to
tabulate
exactly
what
was
meant
in
each
individual
situation
but
the
conclusion
may
be
drawn
that
towns
do
not
assess
movable
personal
property
and
of
the
remainder
only
certain
types
are
valued
for
tax
purposes
were
indicated
specifically
by
only
one
of
the
five
towns
known
to
tax
boats
would
seem
then
that
movable
property
and
equipment
is
not
taxed
as
a
whole
but
that
certain
types
are
taxed
in
towns
where
this
is
bound
to
be
expedient
for
that
particular
kind
of
personal
property
few
answered
the
question
relating
to
their
efforts
to
assess
movable
property
that
the
results
are
inconclusive
four
towns
indicated
that
they
made
any
more
than
a
normal
effort
to
list
property
of
this
kind
greater
interest
is
a
question
as
to
whether
movable
property
was
assessed
according
to
its
location
or
ownership
stated
that
it
was
according
to
location
four
by
residence
of
the
owner
and
nineteen
did
not
answer
assessors
stated
that
they
were
in
favor
of
improved
means
for
assessing
movable
personal
property
and
only
five
were
opposed
others
expressed
no
opinion
this
point
there
was
fairly
general
agreement
that
assessors
would
like
to
do
more
than
they
are
doing
now
is
not
clear
however
whether
they
are
thinking
of
all
movable
property
or
only
of
boats
trailers
aircraft
or
certain
other
types
of
personal
property
whose
assessment
would
be
advantageous
to
their
particular
towns
question
that
was
asked
of
the
assessors
was
whether
they
favored
the
assessment
of
movable
property
at
its
location
or
at
the
residence
of
the
owner
voted
for
assessment
by
the
town
in
which
it
is
located
and
eleven
preferred
assessment
by
the
town
in
which
the
owner
resides
others
made
no
reply
those
who
have
an
opinion
it
seems
that
assessment
by
location
is
preferred
was
one
vote
for
location
being
the
place
where
the
property
is
situated
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
twelve
months
preceding
the
assessment
date
summarize
it
may
be
said
that
there
is
no
one
prevailing
practice
in
with
respect
to
the
taxation
of
movable
property
that
assessors
would
like
to
see
an
improvement
and
of
those
who
have
an
opinion
that
assessment
by
the
town
of
location
is
preferred
on
the
basis
of
their
present
knowledge
need
for
greater
knowledge
is
evident
from
their
replies
as
personal
property
taxing
of
boats
has
been
shown
for
a
number
of
years
by
local
assessors
in
the
possibility
of
taxing
boats
in
are
charged
not
only
with
placing
a
valuation
upon
real
and
personal
property
but
they
also
have
the
responsibility
to
raise
by
a
tax
a
sum
not
less
than
nor
more
than
a
specified
amount
as
ordered
by
a
city
council
or
financial
town
meeting
has
been
obvious
to
the
assessors
particularly
those
in
shore
communities
that
boats
comprise
the
largest
category
of
tangible
personal
property
which
they
have
been
unable
to
reach
their
professional
organization
the
the
question
of
taxing
boats
long
has
been
debated
and
discussed
satisfactory
solution
has
been
found
but
this
is
due
more
to
the
difficulties
inherent
in
the
problem
than
to
a
lack
of
interest
or
diligence
on
the
part
of
the
assessors
has
been
estimated
that
the
value
of
boats
in
waters
is
something
in
excess
of
fifty
million
dollars
excluding
commercial
boats
is
obvious
that
this
is
a
potential
and
lucrative
source
of
revenue
for
the
assessors
of
those
towns
where
a
substantial
amount
of
such
property
would
be
subject
to
taxation
is
known
that
at
least
five
towns
and
place
some
value
on
some
boats
for
tax
purposes
few
are
taxed
and
the
owners
and
location
of
most
boats
are
unknown
to
the
assessors
on
the
date
of
assessment
of
town
valuations
one
really
knows
how
many
boats
there
actually
are
or
what
their
aggregate
value
may
be
more
than
boats
were
registered
with
the
prior
to
the
recent
passage
of
the
state

law
a
few
more
than
boats
had
been
registered
with
the
of
and
at
the
end
of
the
boating
season
but
many
had
been
taken
out
of
the
water

when
the
threat
of
a
hurricane
brought
the
season
to
an
early
close
association
meeting

necessary
for

the
first
step
taken
by
the
planning
division
to
implement
the
state
plan
has
been
to
prepare
two
series
of
base
maps
one
at
a
scale
of
inch
to
a
mile
and
the
second
a
series
of

four
items

the
validity
of
all
subsequent

depends
on
the
accuracy
of
the
basic
inventory
information
great
care
is
being
taken
that
the
inventory
is
as
complete
as
possible
urban
land
use
study
carried
out
by
the
planning

consisted
of

not
within

excellent
summary
of
advantages
concerning
the

and

fiscal
calendars
was
contained
in
a
paper
presented
by
a
public
finance
authority
recently
listed
among
the
values
of
fiscal
uniformity
uniform
fiscal
year
requires
compliance
with
common
sense
administration
of
local
finances
adoption
of
the
budget
or
financial
plan
in
advance
of
spending
uniform
fiscal
year
ensures
conformance
with
another
common
sense
rule
that
of
having
cash
in
the
bank
before
checks
are
drawn
enables
towns
to
make
more
economical
purchases
and
to
take
advantage
of
cash
discounts
uniform
fiscal
year
promotes
more
careful
budgeting
and
strengthens
control
over
expenditures
fixing
the
tax
rate
in
advance
of
spending
upper
limits
are
set
on

uniform
fiscal
year
brings
the
fiscal
year
into
line
with
that
of
the
schools
which
expend
the
largest
share
of
local
disbursements
greatly
simplifies
the
bookkeeping
and
financial
reporting
uniform
fiscal
year
eliminates
interest
charges
on
money
borrowed
in
the
form
of
tax
anticipation
notes
tax
collections
not
immediately
needed
for
current
expenditures
may
be
invested
in
treasury
notes
augmenting
the
miscellaneous
revenues
and
reducing
the
tax
levy
uniform
fiscal
year
facilitates
comparison
of
revenues
and
expenditures
towns
have
the
same
fiscal
year
it
is
relatively
easy
to
make
meaningful
comparisons
and
as
the
cost
of
local
government
increases
the
demand
for
such
comparison
also
increases
having
different
fiscal
years
are
difficult
to
compare
all
advantages
probably
none
is
more
important
than
the
elimination
of
tax
anticipation
notes
in
anticipation
of
current
taxes
and
other
revenues
is
a
routine
procedure
of
the
majority
of
municipalities
at
all
times
may
be
by
bank
loans
sale
of
notes
or
warrants
or
by
the
somewhat
casual
method
of
issuance
and
registration
of
warrants
any
event
it
is
a
form
of
borrowing
which
could
be
and
should
be
rendered
unnecessary
elimination
would
result
in
the
saving
of
interest
costs
heavy
when
money
rates
are
high
and
in
freedom
from
dependence
on
credit
which
is
not
always
available
when
needed
most
type
of
borrowing
can
be
reduced
to
a
minimum
if
quarterly
installment
payment
of
taxes
is
instituted
and
the
first
payment
placed
near
the
opening
of
the
fiscal
year
approach
toward
such
a
system
looks
toward
saving
and
security
should
be
noted
that
there
are
other
and
equally
important
reasons
for
establishing
meaningful
intergovernmental
reporting
bases
on
a
uniform
fiscal
year
the
federal
and
state
governments
commence
their
fiscal
years
on
units
of
government
contribute
increasingly
large
sums
of
money
to
the
several
local
governments
in
this
state
as
indicated
below
has
been
said
that
when
local
government
revenues
were
mostly
produced
locally
from
the
property
tax
the
lack
of
a
uniform
fiscal
year
was
no
great
handicap
but
with
the
growth
of
state
and
federal
fiscal
aid
the
emphasis
on
equalization
and
the
sharing
of
responsibility
for
certain
important
functions
this
is
no
longer
true
haphazard
fiscal
year
calendar
is
an
obstacle
to
the
planning
of
clear
and
efficient
revenue
and
expenditure
relationships
there
are
many
sound
reasons
for
adopting
uniform
and
coordinated
fiscal
years
in
there
are
also
certain
difficulties
encountered
involve
more
the
mechanics
employed
in
adjusting
to
fiscal
uniformity
than
they
do
actual
disadvantages
to
the
principle
problem
is
a
matter
of
shifting
dates
the
other
is
how
to
finance
the
transition
can
be
done
about
the
changing
of
dates
is
an
inherent
part
of
adjusting
fiscal
calendars
usually
means
a
confused
and
disgruntled
public
for
a
period
of
time
cooperation
and
understanding
between
local
officials
and
the
citizenry
help
lessen
this
problem
other
problem
is
the
matter
of
financing
the
transition
period
in
the
several
cities
and
towns
will
be
covered
more
fully
later
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
the
ease
or
difficulty
with
which
a
town
or
city
can
convert
to
the
proposed
plan
is
directly
dependent
upon
the
financial
condition
of
that
town
or
city
there
are
no
cities
or
towns
in
the
state
with
one
or
two
possible
exceptions
that
are
in
too
difficult
a
position
to
finance
the
proposed
change
will
have
to
be
made
in
some
cases
but
it
is
to
the
advantage
to
finance
the
for
a
short
period
of
time
rather
than
pay
interest
on
tax
anticipation
notes
indefinitely
the
fiscal
calendars
advantages
of
a
uniform
fiscal
year
and
well
synchronized
fiscal
and
tax
collection
calendars
are
sufficiently
great
for
municipalities
to
exert
effort
to
secure
them
type
of
program
desired
can
be
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
adjustments
needed
features
are
immediately
evident
the
present
situation
is
too
varied
to
be
systematized
by
any
single
formula
the
shift
to
a
uniform
to
fiscal
year
will
of
itself
improve
the
tax
collection
calendars
of
the
great
majority
of
cities
and
towns
are
at
least
two
problems
to
consider
one
is
a
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
calendar
the
other
is
how
to
finance
the
adjustments

necessary
latter
matter
is
considered
in

from
the
talking
stage
to
establishing
special
committees
to
accomplish
this
end
is
important
here
is
that
many
of
the
cities

recognize
the
need
for
improved
fiscal
practices

are
taking
the
initiative
to
obtain
them
analysis
of
the
fiscal

calendars
throughout
the
state
indicates
that
transition
may
not
be
as
painful
as
is
commonly
thought
it
must
be
stressed

much
depends

neither

be

relatively

an

the
required
adjustment
of
the

years
and
the
towns
involved
are
shown
in
of
financing
adjustments
from
the
matter
of
adjusting
the
fiscal
and
tax
calendars
there
is
the
problem
of
financing
the
adjustment
when
this
is
necessary
should
be
emphasized
strongly
that
adjustments
in
fiscal
dates
or
adoption
of
interim
budgets
do
not
necessarily
mean
financing
over
and
above
normal
governmental
requirements
many
communities
there
is
simply
no
financial
problem
it
is
only
a
matter
of
adjusting
accounting
methods
careful
fiscal
planning
and
management
or
some
like
combination
of
techniques
other
municipalities
the
difficulties
in
overcoming
the
financial
burden
have
been
sufficiently
great
to
dishearten
proponents
of
fiscal
year
changes
such
cases
in
are
more
the
exception
than
the
rule
shown
earlier
in
the
several
cities
and
towns
use
widely
varied
fiscal
and
tax
collection
calendars
addition
no
two
communities
are
identical
in
relation
to
their
financial
condition
factors
practically
insure
that
no
single
financing
formula
is
feasible
each
situation
must
be
studied
and
a
plan
developed
that
takes
into
consideration
such
factors
as
the
effect
of
the
existing
and
prospective
tax
calendars
the
financial
condition
of
the
treasuries
and
the
length
of
the
transition
interval
plans
range
from
those
that
are
very
easy
to
develop
to
those
that
are
difficult
to
formulate
and
require
borrowing
ranging
from
serial
notes
to
bonds
financial
problem
where
it
exists
usually
stems
from
the
adoption
of
a
budget
for
the
transitional
or
adjustment
period
those
communities
which
have
financial
difficulties
in
effecting
adjustments
there
are
a
number
of
alternatives
any
one
of
which

or
in
combination

others
would
minimize

eliminate

the
commuter
railroads
serving

found
it
increasingly
difficult

kind

our
expanding
population
wants

two

solutions
to
the
problems
of

have
been
equally
varied
ranging
all
the
way
from
ownership
to
complete
discontinuance
of
this
important
service

been
a
number
of
sound
plans
proposed
none
of
these

stood
idly

our

decline

failed

the
number
of
people
flowing

increased
tremendously

total
annual

commutation
dropped

this
decline
been
more
painfully
evident

of
the
most
important

has

lost
percent
of
its

this
kind
of
duplication
wasteful

it

the

economic
consequences

obvious
that
was
publicly
committed
to
the
approach
outlined
here
studies
of
the
plan
were
well
underway
far
from
completion
these
studies
indicated
beyond
a

that
savings
would
result

would
be
of
unprecedented
benefit
to
the
railroads

their
investors
their
customers
their
users

to
the
public

the

to
pay
tribute

should

as
their
in
take
great
pride
in
the
as
one
of
the
great
and
authoritative
newspapers
of
the
world
in
my
latest
newsletter
to
my
constituents
urged
the
imposition
of
a
naval
blockade
of
as
the
only
effective
method
of
preventing
continued
armaments
from
coming
into
the
in
violation
of
the
had
the
privilege
of
reading
a
thoughtful
article
in
the
of
which
discussed
this
type
of
action
in
more
detail
including
both
its
advantages
and
its
disadvantages
leave
to
extend
my
remarks
include
the
relevant
portion
of
my
newsletter
together
with
the
text
of
the
article
from
the
your
reports
from
may
have
been
the
setbacks
resulting
from
the
unsuccessful
attempt
of
the
rebels
to
establish
a
beachhead
on
the
mainland
last
week
there
was
at
least
one
positive
benefit
and
that
was
the
revelation
to
the
whole
world
of
the
complete
conversion
of
into
a
military
base
fact
one
of
the
major
reasons
for
the
failure
of
the
expedition
appears
to
have
been
a
lack
of
full
information
on
the
extent
to
which
has
been
getting
this
military
equipment
the
pictures
and
stories
of
tanks
on
beaches
and
jet
fighters
strafing
rebel
troops
has
brought
home
to
all
of
us
the
stark
blunt
truth
of
what
it
means
to
have
a
military
base
miles
away
from
home
tanks
and
planes
in
jeopardize
the
security
of
the
violate
the
and
threaten
the
security
of
every
other
republic
the
full
extent
of
this
military
penetration
of
was
clear
announced
we
would
take
whatever
action
was
appropriate
to
prevent
this
even
if
we
had
to
go
it
alone
the
republics
who
have
been
rather
inclined
to
drag
their
feet
on
taking
action
against
also
reacted
swiftly
last
week
by
finally
throwing
off
the
years
the
had
been
trying
to
get
these
countries
to
exclude
representative
from
secret
military
talks
it
took
the
pictures
of
the
and
the
tanks
to
do
the
job
is
a
new
atmosphere
of
urgency
in
this
week
can
see
it
for
example
in
the
extensive
efforts
has
made
to
enlist
solid
bipartisan
support
for
his
actions
toward
both
and
efforts
as
see
it
which
are
being
directed
by
the
way
toward
support
for
future
actions
not
for
those
already
past
the
next
move
will
be
only
time
of
course
will
tell
think
we
ought
to
set
up
an
immediate
naval
blockade
of
simply
tolerate
further
weapons
including
the
possibility
of
nuclear
missiles
being
located
in
we
stop
them
from
coming
in
however
just
by
talk
naval
blockade
would
be
thoroughly
in
line
with
the
would
be
a
relatively
simple
operation
to
carry
out
and
would
bring
an
abrupt
end
to
penetration
of
our
hemisphere
from
next
for
an
arms
blockade
at
now
cockier
than
ever
with
arms
and
agents
to
threaten
the
can
the
act
is
one
answer
offered
by
experts
it
they
see
a
way
to
isolate
stop
infiltration
maybe
finish
too
is
the
question
now
facing
to
put
a
stop
to
the
buildup
in
and
to
infiltration
of
this
hemisphere
the
reported
that
a
total
embargo
of
remaining
trade
with
was
being
considered
aim
undermine
further
economy
strategy
bolder
and
tougher
was
also
attracting
notice
in
a
naval
and
air
blockade
to
cut
off
from
the
world
destroy
in
the
view
of
military
and
civilian
experts
could
restore
teeth
to
the
could
halt
a
flood
of
arms
and
strategic
supplies
now
reaching
could
stop
of
guns
and
propaganda
materials
to
would
be
the
most
severe
reprisal
short
of
declared
war
that
the
could
invoke
against
is
the
strategy
of
blockade
therefore
that
is
suddenly
at
the
center
of
attention
of
administration
officials
of
officers
in
the
a
possible
course
of
action
it
also
is
the
center
of
debate
and
is
raising
many
questions
these
questions
what
would
a
blockade
take
experts
say
a
tight
naval
blockade
off
ports
and
at
the
approaches
to
waters
would
require
two
naval
task
forces
each
built
around
an
aircraft
carrier
with
a
complement
of
about
planes
and
several
destroyers

it

the

number
of

vicinity
of

other
big
ships
are
no
less
than
a
sailing
time
away
round
out
the
blockading
force
submarines
would
be
needed
to
locate
identify
and
track
approaching
vessels
radar
would
help
with
this
task
would
radar
picket
ships
squadron
of
jets
and
another
of
patrol
planes
would
add
support
to
the
carrier
task
forces
requirements
go
with
a
blockade
must
be
proclaimed
the
blockading
force
must
be
powerful
enough
to
enforce
it
and
it
must
be
enforced
without
discrimination
these
conditions
of
international
law
are
met
countries
that
try
to
run
the
blockade

so
at
their
own
risk
runners
can

held
at

temporarily

to
ports
for

whether

a

the
experts

broad

therefore
affirm
the

registered
with
on

to
the

reflected
that
he
was
a
minister
of
employed
at
night
by
a
sugar
producer
claimed

as
a
minister
of
religion
devoting
a
minimum
of
hours
a
month
to
preaching
he
was
classified
in
he
wrote
the
protesting
this
classification
again
stated
that
he
was
a
regular
minister
that
he
was
devoting
an
average
of
hours
a
month
to
actual
preaching
publicly
in
addition
to
to
hours
in
other
ministerial
duties
and
that
he
opposed

in
any
form
he
was
classified
after
some
six
months
of
pioneering
petitioner
discontinued
devoting
hours
a
month
to
preaching
but
failed
to
so
notify
his
local
board
a
periodic
review
the
local
board
on
reclassified
him
and
upheld
this
classification
after
a
personal
appearance
by
petitioner
because
of
his
willingness
to
kill
in
defense
of
his
church
and
home
administrative
approval
of
the
reclassification
he
was
ordered
to
report
for

failed
to
do

was
not
prosecuted
however
and
his
case
was
subsequently
reopened

the
light

again
reclassified
by
the
local
board
followed
a
customary
of
hearing
at
which
petitioner
appeared
his
report
to
the
the
hearing
officer
suggested
that
the
petitioner
be
exempt
only
from
combatant
training
and
service
however
the
recommended
approval
of
the
classification
ground
for
this
recommendation
was
that
while
petitioner
claimed
before
the
local
board
as
evidenced
by
its
memorandum
in
his
file
of
that
date
that
he
was
devoting
hours
per
month
to
actual
preaching
the
headquarters
of
the
reported
that
he
was
no
longer
doing
so
and
on
the
contrary
had
relinquished
both
his
and
positions
reported
that
he
now
devoted
only
some
hours
per
month
to
public
preaching
and
from
to
hours
per
month
to
church
activities
claim
was
therefore
so
highly
exaggerated
the
concluded
that
it
cast
doubt
upon
his
veracity
and
consequently
upon
his
sincerity
and
good
faith
appeal
board
furnished
petitioner
a
copy
of
the
recommendation
his
answer
thereto
he
advised
the
that
he
had
made
no
such
statement
in
and
asserted
that
his
only
claim
to
pioneering
was
in
appeal
board
however
unanimously
concurred
in
the
recommendation
return
of
the
file
to
the
local
board
petitioner
was
again
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
this
prosecution
followed
his
failure
to
do
so
first
contends
that
the
denied
him
procedural
due
process
by
not
giving
him
timely
opportunity
before
its
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
to
answer
the
statement
of
the
local
board
as
to
his
claim
of
devoting
hours
to
actual
preaching
the
statement
of
the
local
board
attributing
this
claim
to
petitioner
was
in
his
file
admitted
that
he
knew
it
was
open
to
him
at
all
times
and
he
could
have
rebutted
it
before
the
hearing
officer
he
failed
to
do
asserting
that
he
did
not
know
it
to
be
in
his
file
he
never
took
the
trouble
to
find
out
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
contest
the
statement
before
the
appeal
board
the
recommendation
of
the
is
forwarded
to
the
appeal
board
that
is
the
appropriate
place
for
a
registrant
to
lodge
his
denial
he
did
found
in
supra
that
this
was
the
controlling
reason
why
copies
of
the
recommendation
should
be
furnished
a
registrant
said
there
that
it
was
necessary
that
a
registrant
be
given
an
opportunity
to
rebut
the
recommendation
when
it
comes
to
the
the
agency
with
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
classification
at
fail
to
see
how
such
procedure
resulted
in
any
prejudice
to
contention
which
was
considered
by
the
appeal
board
and
denied
by
it
was
said
in
it
is
the
which
renders
the
selective
service
determination
considered
final
in
the
courts
not
to
be
overturned
unless
there
is
no
basis
in
fact
at
there
are
other
contentions
which
might
be
considered
more
difficult
his
trial
petitioner
sought
to
secure
through
subpoena
duces
tecum
the
longhand
notes
of
the
hearing
officer
as
well
as
his
report
thereon
also
claimed
at
trial
the
right
to
inspect
the
original
of
reports
to
the
of
alleged
no
specific
procedural
errors
or
evidence
withheld
nor
did
he
elaborate
just
what
favorable
evidence
the
of
reports
might
disclose
of
the
as
we
have
held
does
require
the
recommendation
to
be
placed
in
a
file
supra
there
is
nothing
in
the
requiring
the
hearing
report
to
be
likewise
turned
over
to
the
registrant
the
regulations
formerly
required
that
the
hearing
report
be
placed
in
the
file
this
requirement
was
eliminated
in
the
hearing
report
is
but
intradepartmental
is
directed
to
the
and
of
course
is
not
the
recommendation
of
the
is
not
essentially
different
from
a
memorandum
of
an
attorney
in
the
of
of
which
the
receives
many
and
to
which
he
may
give
his
approval
or
rejection
is
but
part
of
the
whole
process
within
the
that
goes
into
the
making
of
the
final
recommendation
to
the
appeal
board
is
also
significant
that
neither
this
report
nor
the
hearing
notes
were
furnished
to
the
appeal
board
the
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
to
traverse
the
only
conclusions
of
the
on
file
with
the
knew
that
the
recommendation
was
based
not
on
the
hearing
report
but
on
the
statement
of
the
local
board
in
his
file
had
every
opportunity
to
rebut
the
finding
of
the
local
board
before
both
the
hearing
officer
and
the
appeal
board
petitioner
cannot
now
claim
that
he
was
denied
due
process
because
he
did
not
succeed
appears
to
us
that
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
production
of
the
hearing
report
and
notes
at
the
trial
addition
petitioner
has
failed
to
show
any
particular
need
for
the
report
and
notes
there
are
now
allegations
of
the
withholding
of
favorable
evidence
developed
at
the
hearing
and
a
denial
of
a
full
and
fair
hearing
no
such
claim
was
made
by
petitioner
at
any
stage
of
the
administrative
process
his
testimony
at
trial
never
developed
any
such
facts
the
light
of
these
circumstances
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
issue
at
trial
in
this
respect
centered
entirely
on
the
recommendation
which
petitioner
repudiated
but
which
both
the
appeal
board
and
the
courts
below
found
supported
by
the
record
we
find
no
relevancy
in
the
hearing
report
and
notes
petitioner
says
that
he
was
entitled
to
inspect
the
report
during
the
proceedings
before
the
hearing
officer
as
well
as
at
the
trial
did
receive
a
resume
of
it
the
same
that
was
furnished
the
appeal
board
and
he
made
no
claim
of
its
inaccuracy
now
no
such
claim
is
asserted
bases
his
present
contention
on
the
general
right
to
explore
indicating
that
he
hopes
to
find
some
discrepancy
in
the
resume
this
is
fully
answered
by
supra
we
held
that
the
statutory
scheme
for
review
within
the
selective
service
system
entitles
conscientious
objectors
to
no
guarantee
that
the
reports
must
be
produced
for
their
inspection
at
if
we
were
not
bound
by
petitioner
here
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
report
recommendation
of
the
as
well
as
the
decision
of
the
appeal
board
was
based
entirely
on
the
local
board
file
not
on
an
report
policy
in
its
total
context
this
enlarged
role
in
mind
should
like
to
make
a
few
suggestions
we
in
the
do
or
do
not
do
will
make
a
very
large
difference
in
what
happens
in
the
rest
of
the
world
in
this
must
think
about
foreign
policy
in
its
total
context
cannot
regard
foreign
policy
as
something
left
over
after
defense
policy
or
trade
policy
or
fiscal
policy
has
been
extracted
policy
is
the
total
involvement
of
the
people
with
peoples
and
governments
abroad
means
that
if
we
are
to
achieve
a
new
standard
of
leadership
we
must
think
in
terms
of
the
total
context
of
our
situation
is
the
concern
of
the
of
that
the
people
are
safe
and
secure
defense
is
not
a
monopoly
concern
of
the
of
is
also
the
concern
of
the
of
that
our
trading
relationships
with
the
rest
of
the
world
are
vigorous
profitable
and
active
this
is
not
just
a
passing
interest
or
a
matter
of
concern
only
to
the
of
can
no
longer
rely
on
interdepartmental
machinery
somewhere
upstairs
to
resolve
differences
between
this
and
other
departments
of
will
now
carry
an
increased
burden
of
active
formulation
and
coordination
of
policies
must
be
found
to
enable
us
to
keep
in
touch
as
regularly
and
as
efficiently
as
possible
with
our
colleagues
in
other
departments
concerned
with
foreign
policy
think
we
need
to
concern
ourselves
also
with
the
timeliness
of
action
policy
officer
cannot
help
but
be
a
planning
officer
we
keep
our
eyes
on
the
horizon
ahead
we
shall
fail
to
bring
ourselves
on
target
with
the
present
movement
of
events
is
so
fast
the
pace
so
severe
that
an
attempt
to
peer
into
the
future
is
essential
if
we
are
to
think
accurately
about
the
present
there
is
anything
which
we
can
do
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
to
speed
up
the
processes
by
which
we
come
to
decisions
on
matters
on
which
we
must
act
promptly
that
in
itself
would
be
a
major
contribution
to
the
conduct
of
our
affairs
taken
today
is
often
far
more
valuable
than
action
taken
several
months
later
in
response
to
a
situation
then
out
of
control
will
of
course
be
times
for
delay
and
inaction
am
suggesting
is
that
when
we
delay
or
when
we
fail
to
act
we
do
so
intentionally
and
not
through
inadvertence
or
through
bureaucratic
or
procedural
difficulties
also
hope
that
we
can
do
something
about
reducing
the
infant
mortality
rate
of
ideas
an
affliction
of
all
bureaucracies
want
to
stimulate
ideas
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
want
to
make
sure
that
our
junior
colleagues
realize
that
ideas
are
welcome
that
initiative
goes
right
down
to
the
bottom
and
goes
all
the
way
to
the
top
hope
no
one
expects
that
only
appointees
are
looked
upon
as
sources
of
ideas
responsibility
for
taking
the
initiative
in
generating
ideas
is
that
of
every
officer
in
the
who
has
a
policy
function
regardless
of
rank
would
hope
that
we
could
pay
attention
to
little
things
observing
the
operations
of
our
in
various
parts
of
the
world
have
felt
that
in
many
situations
where
our
policies
were
good
we
have
tended
to
ignore
minor
problems
which
spoiled
our
main
effort
cite
only
a
few
examples
wrong
man
in
the
wrong
position
perhaps
even
in
a
junior
position
abroad
can
be
a
source
of
great
harm
to
our
policy
the
attitudes
of
a
delegate
who
experiences
difficulty
in
finding
adequate
housing
in
or
of
a
foreign
diplomat
in
similar
circumstances
in
our
can
easily
be
directed
against
the
and
all
that
it
stands
for
of
seemingly
small
matters
go
wrong
all
over
the
world
those
who
know
about
them
are
too
far
down
the
line
to
be
able
to
do
anything
about
them
would
hope
that
we
could
create
the
recognition
in
the
and
overseas
that
those
who
come
across
little
things
going
wrong
have
the
responsibility
for
bringing
these
to
the
attention
of
those
who
can
do
something
about
them
the
of
is
to
take
primary
responsibility
for
foreign
policy
in
it
follows
that
the
ambassador
is
expected
to
take
charge
overseas
does
not
mean
in
a
purely
bureaucratic
sense
but
in
an
active
operational
interested
responsible
fashion
is
expected
to
know
about
what
is
going
on
among
the
representatives
of
other
agencies
who
are
stationed
in
his
country
is
expected
to
supervise
to
encourage
to
direct
to
assist
in
any
way
he
can
any
official
operation
abroad
begins
to
go
wrong
we
shall
look
to
the
ambassador
to
find
out
why
and
to
get
suggestions
for
remedial
action
problems
of
a
policy
officer
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
be
interested
in
some
thoughts
which
expressed
privately
in
recent
years
in
the
hope
of
clearing
up
a
certain
confusion
in
the
public
mind
about
what
foreign
policy
is
all
about
and
what
it
means
and
of
developing
a
certain
compassion
for
those
who
are
carrying
such
responsibilities
inside
tried
to
do
so
by
calling
to
their
attention
some
of
the
problems
that
a
senior
departmental
policy
officer
faces
means
practically
everybody
in
this
room
it
will
strike
home
for
you
or
not
will
be
for
you
to
determine
senior
policy
officer
may
be
moved
to
think
hard
about
a
problem
by
any
of
an
infinite
variety
of
stimuli
an
idea
in
his
own
head
the
suggestions
of
a
colleague
a
question
from
the
or
the
a
proposal
by
another
department
a
communication
from
a
foreign
government
or
an
ambassador
abroad
the
filing
of

item
for
the

of
the

of
any
other
of

policy
officer
lives
with
his
antennae
alerted
for
the
questions
which
fall
within
his
range
of
responsibility
first
thought
is
about
the
question
itself
there
a
question
here
for
foreign
policy
and
if
so
what
is
it
he
knows
that
the
first
and
sometimes
most
difficult
job
is
to
know
what
the
question
is
that
when
it
is
accurately
identified
it
sometimes
answers
itself
and
that
the
way
in
which
it
is
posed
frequently
shapes
the
answer
it
over
with
his
colleagues
and
in
his
own
mind
he
reaches
a
tentative
identification
of
the
question
tentative
because
it
may
change
as
he
explores
it
further
and
because
if
no
tolerable
answer
can
be
found
it
may
have
to
be
changed
into
one
which
can
be
answered
he
has
been
thinking
about
the
facts
surrounding
the
problem
facts
which
he
knows
can
never
be
complete
and
the
general
background
much
of
which
has
already
been
lost
to
history
is
appreciative
of
the
expert
help
available
to
him
and
draws
these
resources
into
play
taking
care
to
examine
at
least
some
of
the
raw
material
which
underlies
their
frequently
conclusions
knows
that
he
must
give
the
expert
his
place
but
he
knows
that
he
must
also
keep
him
in
it
is
already
beginning
to
box
the
compass
of
alternative
lines
of
action
including
doing
nothing
knows
that
he
is
thinking
about
action
in
relation
to
a
future
which
can
be
perceived
but
dimly
through
a
merciful
fog
he
takes
his
bearings
from
the
great
guidelines
of
policy
precedents
the
commitments
of
the
under
international
charters
and
treaties
basic
statutes
and
notions
of
the
people
about
how
we
are
to
conduct
ourselves
in
policy
literature
such
as
country
papers
and
papers
accumulated
in
the
will
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
general
principles
produce
conflicting
results
in
the
factual
situation
with
which
he
is
confronted
must
think
about
which
of
these
principles
must
take
precedence
will
know
that
general
policy
papers
written
months
before
may
not
fit
his
problem
because
of
crucial
changes
in
circumstance
is
aware
that
every
moderately
important
problem
merges
imperceptibly
into
every
other
problem
must
deal
with
the
question
of
how
to
manage
a
part
when
it
cannot
be
handled
without
relation
to
the
whole
when
the
whole
is
too
large
to
grasp
must
think
of
others
who
have
a
stake
in
the
question
and
in
its
answer
should
be
consulted
among
his
colleagues
in
the
or
other
departments
and
agencies
of
the
ambassadors
could
provide
helpful
advice
private
interests
sufficiently
involved
to
be
consulted
is
the
probable
attitude
of
other
governments

those
less
directly
involved

at
what
stage
and
in
what
sequence
are
other
governments
to
be
consulted

is
indicated
what
kind
of

at
worst
an
unwanted
inflammation
of
the
problem
itself
the
or
the
act
under
existing
authority
or
will
new
legislation
and
new
money
be
required
the
action
be
unilateral
or
multilateral
the
matter
one
for
the
or
some
other
international
body
if
so
the
path
leads
through
a
complex
process
of
parliamentary
diplomacy
which
adds
still
another
dimension
to
the
problem
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
type
of
action
can
hope
to
win
public
support
first
in
this
country
and
then
abroad
the
policy
officer
will
know
that
action
can
almost
never
be
secret
and
that
in
general
the
effectiveness
of
policy
will
be
conditioned
by
the
readiness
of
the
country
to
sustain
it
is
interested
in
public
opinion
for
two
reasons
first
because
it
is
important
in
itself
and
second
because
he
knows
that
the
public
cares
about
a
decent
respect
for
the
opinions
of
mankind
given
probable
public
attitudes
about
which
reasonably
good
estimates
can
be
made
what
action
is
called
for
to
insure
necessary
support
add
a
caution
on
this
particular
point
do
not
want
policy
officers
below
the
level
of
appointees
to
concern
themselves
too
much
with
problems
of
domestic
politics
in
recommending
foreign
policy
action
the
first
place
our
business
is
foreign
policy
and
it
is
the
business
of
the
leadership
and
his
appointees
in
the
to
consider
the
domestic
political
aspects
of
a
problem
emphasized
this
point
by
saying
fellows
in
the
of
know
much
about
domestic
politics
is
an
important
consideration
we
sit
here
reading
editorials
and
looking
at
polls
and
other
reports
that
cross
our
desks
we
should
realize
that
this
is
raw
undigested
opinion
expressed
in
the
absence
of
leadership
the
people
will
do
turns
in
large
degree
on
their
leadership
cannot
test
public
opinion
until
the
and
the
leaders
of
the
country
have
gone
to
the
public
to
explain
what
is
required
and
have
asked
them
for
support
for
the
necessary
action
doubt
for
example
that
months
before
the
leadership
began
to
talk
about
what
came
to
be
the
plan
any
expert
would
have
said
that
the
country
would
have
accepted
such
proposals
problem
in
the
policy
mind
thus
begins
to
take
shape
as
a
galaxy
of
utterly
complicated
factors
political
military
economic
financial
legal
legislative
procedural
administrative
to
be
sorted
out
and
handled
within
a
political
system
which
moves
by
consent
in
relation
to
an
external
environment
which
cannot
be
under
control
the
policy
officer
has
the
hounds
of
time
snapping
at
his
heels
there
should
be
no
general
age
limit
or
restriction
to
one
sex
there
will
be
particular
projects
requiring
special
maturity
and
some
open
only
to
men
or
to
women
should
not
pay
the
expenses
of
a
wife
or
family
unless
the
wife
is
also
accepted
for
work
on
the
same
project
should
be
no
draft
exemption
because
of
service
most
cases
service
in
the
will
probably
be
considered
a
ground
for
temporary
deferment
volunteers
obviously
should
not
be
paid
what
they
might
earn
in
comparable
activities
in
the
would
it
be
possible
in
many
cases
for
them
to
live
in
health
or
any
effectiveness
on
what
their
counterparts
abroad
are
paid
guiding
principle
indeed
should
not
be
anything
like
compensation
for
individual
services
the
principle
should
be
akin
to
that
of
the
allowance
volunteers
should
be
given
just
enough
to
provide
a
minimum
decent
standard
of
living
should
live
in
modest
circumstances
avoiding
all
conspicuous
consumption
possible
they
should
live
with
their
host
country
counterparts
special
health
requirements
might
have
to
be
met
example
it
probably
will
be
necessary
for
the
to
have
authority
to
pay
medical
expenses
of
volunteers
existing
and
medical
facilities
can
be
utilized
readjustment
to
the
volunteers
should
be
given
some
separation
allowance
at
the
end
of
their
overseas
service
based
on
the
length
of
time
served
what
part
of
the
government
should
the
be
established
idea
of
a
has
captured
the
imagination
of
a
great
many
people
for
it
cuts
across
party
regional
ethnic
and
other
lines
therefore
offers
an
opportunity
to
add
a
new
dimension
to
our
approach
to
the
world
an
opportunity
for
the
people
to
think
anew
and
start
afresh
in
their
participation
in
world
development
this
the
should
be
administered
by
a
small
new
alive
agency
operating
as
one
component
in
our
whole
overseas
operation
the
reorganization
of
our
foreign
aid
structure
and
program
the
should
be
established
as
an
agency
in
the
of
the
aid
operations
are
reorganized
the
should
remain
a
functional
unit
the
could
be
physically
located
in
facilities
and
depend
on
the
and
for
administrative
support
and
when
needed
program
assistance
this
way
the
can
be
launched
with
its
own
identity
and
spirit
and
yet
receive
the
necessary
assistance
from
those
now
responsible
for
foreign
policy
and
our
overseas
operations
and
when
should
the
be
launched
can
either
begin
in
very
low
gear
with
only
preparatory
work
undertaken
between
now
and
when
finally
appropriates
special
funds
for
it
or
it
can
be
launched
now
and
in
earnest
by
executive
action
with
sufficient
funds
and
made
available
from
existing
appropriations
to
permit
a
number
of
substantial
projects
to
start
this
summer
should
be
launched
soon
so
that
the
opportunity
to
recruit
the
most
qualified
people
from
this
graduating
classes
will
not
be
lost
should
we
lose
the
opportunity
to
use
this
summer
for
training
on
university
campuses
launched
in
a
careful
but
determined
way
within
the
next
few
weeks
the
could
have
several
hundred
persons
in
training
this
summer
for
placement
next
fall
a
year
or
two
several
thousand
might
be
in
service
can
then
grow
steadily
as
it
proves
itself
and
as
the
need
for
it
is
demonstrated
would
the
first
projects
be
the
first
year
there
should
probably
be
considerable
emphasis
on
teaching
projects
need
here
is
most
clearly
felt
and
our
capacity
to
recruit
and
train
qualified
volunteers
in
a
short
period
of
time
is
greatest
would
however
be
a
variety
of
other
skills
medical
agricultural
engineering
which
would
be
called
for
in
the
first
year
through
the
private
agency
programs
and
through
the
provision
of
technician
helpers
to
existing
development
projects
first
projects
should
also
be
spread
through
several
countries
in
and
will
the
be
received
abroad
the
need
for
outside
trained
manpower
exists
in
every
newly
developing
nation
the
readiness
to
receive
such
manpower
or
to
receive
it
from
the
will
vary
from
country
to
country
certain
skepticism
about
the
coming
of
is
to
be
expected
in
many
quarters
political
groups
will
no
doubt
do
everything
in
their
power
to
promote
active
hostility
there
are
indications
that
many
developing
nations
will
welcome
volunteers
and
that
if
the
volunteers
are
well
chosen
they
will
soon
demonstrate
their
value
and
make
many
friends
is
important
however
that
the
be
advanced
not
as
an
arm
of
the
but
as
a
contribution
to
the
world
community
presenting
it
to
other
governments
and
to
the
we
could
propose
that
every
nation
consider
the
formation
of
its
own
peace
corps
and
that
the
sponsor
the
idea
and
form
an
international
coordinating
committee
should
hope
that
peace
corps
projects
will
be
truly
international
and
that
our
citizens
will
find
themselves
working
alongside
citizens
of
the
host
country
and
also
volunteers
from
other
lands
any
case
our
personnel
should
be
offered
as
technician
helpers
in
development
projects
of
the
and
other
international
agencies
is
not
a
diplomatic
or
propaganda
venture
but
a
genuine
experiment
in
international
partnership
aim
must
be
to
learn
as
much
as
we
teach
offers
an
opportunity
to
bring
home
to
the
the
problems
of
the
world
as
well
as
an
opportunity
to
meet
urgent
host
country
needs
for
trained
manpower
presented
in
this
spirit
the
response
and
the
results
will
be
immeasurably
better
will
it
be
financed
already
appropriated

the
discretion
of

is
decided
to
make
a
small
shift
which
may
be
required
from
military
aid
or
special
assistance
funds
in
order
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
through
this
new
peaceful
program
this
will
be
a
hopeful
sign
to
the
world
should
then
be
asked
to
give
the
a
firm
legislative
foundation
for
the
next
fiscal
year
should
consider
authorizing
the
to
receive
contributions
from
businesses
unions
civic
organizations
and
the
public
at
large
this
must
be
the
project
of
the
whole
people
of
outstanding
public
figures
with
experience
in

affairs
should
be
formed
to
give
the

continuing

to
afford
a

also
be
taken

that
foreign

all
this
may
combine
to
provide

this
is
meeting
the
need
too
since
what
the

most
needs
from

what

perhaps
the

the

has
necessitated
a
continuous
review

reevaluation
of
the

to
redirect

the

a
number
of

the

of

a

diminished
by
the

of
the

rapidly
shifting
the
main

from

the

of

in

the

now
raised
serious
questions
about
the
value
of
the
fuel
program
a
result
the
scope
of
this
project
has
been
sharply
curtailed
examples
underscore
the
importance
of
even
more
searching
evaluations
of
new
major
development
programs
and
even
more
penetrating
and
analyses
of
the
potentialities
of
future
technology
cost
of
developing
a
major
weapon
system
is
now
so
enormous
that
the
greatest
care
must
be
exercised
in
selecting
new
systems
for
development
in
determining
the
most
satisfactory
rate
of
development
and
in
deciding
the
proper
time
at
which
either
to
place
a
system
into
production
or
to
abandon
it
forces
deterrent
power
of
our
comes
from
both
their
nuclear
retaliatory
capability
and
their
capability
to
conduct
other
essential
operations
in
any
form
of
war
first
capability
is
represented
by
a
combination
of
manned
bombers
aircraft
and
intercontinental
and
intermediate
range
missiles
second
capability
is
represented
by
our
deployed
ground
naval
and
air
forces
in
essential
forward
areas
together
with
ready
reserves
capable
of
effecting
early
emergency
reinforcement
is
the
principal
element
of
our
nuclear
capability
of
the
important
and
difficult
decisions
which
had
to
be
made
in
this
budget
concerned
the
role
of
the
a
supersonic
bomber
aircraft
which
was
planned
for
initial
operational
use
about
would
be
complementary
to
but
likewise
competitive
with
the
four
strategic
ballistic
missile
systems
all
of
which
are
scheduled
to
become
available
earlier
first
are
now
operational
the
first
two
submarines
are
expected
to
be
operational
this
calendar
year
and
the
first
next
year
is
planned
to
be
operational
about
several
or
all
of
these
systems
will
have
been
fully
tested
and
their
reliability
established
the
need
for
the
as
a
strategic
weapon
system
is
doubtful
am
recommending
that
development
work
on
the
and
engines
be
continued
is
expected
that
in
two
prototype
aircraft
will
be
available
for
flight
testing
that
time
we
should
be
in
a
much
better
position
to
determine
the
value
of
that
aircraft
as
a
weapon
system
am
recommending
additional
acquisitions
of
the
improved
version
of
the
the
with
the
new
turbofan
engine
and
procurement
of
the
supersonic
medium
bomber
together
with
the
supporting
refueling
tankers
in
each
case
additional
modern
bombers
will
replace
some
of
the
older
medium
bombers
one
can
do
the
work
of
several
which
it
will
replace
are
also
included
in
this
budget
to
continue
the
equipping
of
the
wings
with
the
missile
the
coming
fiscal
year
additional
quantities
of
and
missiles
also
will
be
procured
authorizations
will
include
provisions
relating
to
the
sale
and
delivery
of
commodities
including
the
classes
types
varieties
of
food
grain
the
time
and
circumstances
of
deposit
of
the

accruing
from
such

and
other
relevant
matters
recognizes
the
desire
of
to
accumulate
as
quickly
as
possible
a
substantial
part
of
the
one
million
ton
reserve
stock
of
rice
provided
for

this
to
assist
in
stabilizing
the
internal

for
this

in
this
the
first
annual
review
of

availabilities
will
be
made

be
possible
in

subject
to

public
interest
both
the
determination
of
what
degree
of
interference
shall
be
considered
excessive
and
the
methods
by
which
such
excessive
interference
shall
be
avoided
present
proceeding
is
concerned
with
the
standard
broadcast
band
from
to
two
or
more
standard
broadcast
stations
operate
simultaneously
on
the
same
or
closely
adjacent
frequencies
each
interferes
to
some
extent
with
reception
of
the
other
extent
of
such
interference
which
may
be
so
slight
as
to
be
undetectable
at
any
point
where
either
of
the
stations
renders
a
usable
signal
or
may
be
so
great
as
to
virtually
destroy
the
service
areas
of
both
stations
depends
on
many
factors
among
the
principal
ones
being
the
distance
between
the
stations
their
respective
radiated
power
and
of
particular
significance
here
the
time
of
day
factors
playing
a
part
in
the
extent
of
service
and
interference
are
the
frequency
involved
the
time
of
year
the
position
of
the
year
in
the
sunspot
cycle
ground
conductivity
along
the
transmission
path
atmospheric
and
manmade
noise
and
others
the
existence
of
these
many
factors
some
of
them
variable
it
obviously
has
never
been
and
is
not
now
possible
for
the
to
make
assignments
of
stations
on
a
basis
which
will
insure
against
any
interference
in
any
circumstances
such
assignments
are
made
as
they
must
be
on
the
basis
of
certain
overall
rules
and
standards
representing
to
some
extent
a
statistical
approach
to
the
problem
taking
into
account
for
each
situation
some
of
the
variables
power
and
station
separations
and
averaging
out
others
in
order
to
achieve
the
balance
which
must
be
struck
between
protection
against
destructive
interference
and
the
assignment
of
a
number
of
stations
large
enough
to
afford
optimum
radio
service
to
the
example
of
the
overall
standards
applied
is
the
ratio
established
for
the
determination
of
that
degree
of
cochannel
interference
which
is
regarded
as
objectionable
this
standard
it
is
determined
that
where
two
stations
operating
on
the
same
frequency
are
involved
objectionable
interference
from
station
exists
at
any
point
within
the
service
area
of
station
where
station
signal
is
of
an
intensity
or
more
of
the
strength
of
station
signal
at
that
point
ratio
for
cochannel
interference
embodies
one
of
the
fundamental
limiting
principles
which
we
must
always
take
into
account
in
assignments
and
allocations
that
signals
from
a
particular
station
are
potential
sources
of
objectionable
interference
over
an
area
much
greater
than
that
within
which
they
provide
useful
service
second
fundamental
principle
is
that
involved
particularly
in
the
present
proceeding
the
difference
between
nighttime
and
daytime
propagation
conditions
with
respect
to
the
standard
broadcast
frequencies
is
a
phenomenon
familiar
to
all
radio
listeners
resulting
from
reflection
of
skywave
signals
at
night
from
the
ionized
layer
in
the
upper
atmosphere
known
as
the
ionosphere
stations
radiate
both
skywave
and
groundwave
signals
at
all
hours
but
during
the
middle
daytime
hours
these
skywave
radiations
are
not
reflected
in
any
substantial
quantity
and
during
this
portion
of
the
day
both
skywave
service
and
skywave
interference
are
in
general
negligible
during
nighttime
hours
the
skywave
radiations
are
reflected
from
the
ionosphere
thereby
creating
the
possibility
of
one
rendering
service
via
skywave
at
a
much
greater
distance
than
it
can
through
its
groundwave
signal
and
at
the
same
time
vastly
complicating
the
interference
problem
because
of
the
still
greater
distance
over
which
these
skywave
signals
may
cause
interference
to
the
signals
of
stations
on
the
same
and
closely
adjacent
frequencies
of
the
difference
between
daytime
and
nighttime
propagation
conditions
it
has
been
necessary
to
evolve
different
allocation
structures
for
daytime
and
nighttime
broadcasting
in
the
band
with
many
more
stations
operating
during
the
day
than
at
night
was
recognized
years
ago
that
the
transition
from
daytime
to
nighttime
propagation
conditions
and
vice
versa
is
not
an
instantaneous
process
but
takes
place
over
periods
of
time
from
roughly
hours
before
sunset
until
about
hours
after
sunset
and
again
from
roughly
hours
before
sunrise
until
some
hours
after
sunrise
the
period
of
about
hours
around
sunset
skywave
transmission
conditions
are
building
up
until
full
nighttime
conditions
prevail
during
the
same
period
around
sunrise
skywave
transmission
is
declining
until
at
about
hours
after
sunrise
it
reaches
a
point
where
it
becomes
of
little
practical
significance
in
this
case
as
elsewhere
it
was
necessary
to
arrive
at
a
single
standard
to
be
applied
to
all
situations
representing
an
averaging
of
conditions
and
thus
to
fix
particular
points
in
time
which
would
be
considered
the
dividing
points
between
daytime
and
nighttime
conditions
was
determined
that
the
hours
of
sunrise
and
sunset
respectively
should
be
used
for
this
purpose
the
rules
adopted
these
hours
as
limitations
upon
the
operation
of
daytime
stations
stations
operating
on
clear
channels
are
required
to
cease
operation
or
operate
under
nighttime
restrictions
beginning
either
at
local
sunset
for
daytime
class
stations
or
sunset
at
the
location
of
the
dominant
class
station
where
located
west
of
the
class
station
for
class
stations
same
restrictions
apply
after
local
sunset
in
the
case
of
class
stations
operating
on
regional
channels
which
after
that
time
are
required
to
operate
under
nighttime
restrictions
in
order
to
protect
each
other
respect
to
nighttime
assignments
the
degree
of
skywave
service
and
interference
is
determined
by
skywave
curves
and
of
of
the
rules
giving
average
skywave
values
curves
were
derived
by
an
analysis
of
extensive
skywave
measurement
data
was
recognized
that
skywave
signals
because
of
their
reflected
nature
are
of
great
variability
and
subject
to
wide
fluctuations
in
strength
this
reason
the
more
uncertain
skywave
service
was
denominated
secondary
in
our
rules
as
compared
to
the
steadier
more
reliable
groundwave
primary
service
and
for
both
skywave
service
and
skywave
interference
signal
strength
is
expressed
in
terms
of
percentage
of
time
a
particular
level
is
exceeded

of
the
time
for
skywave
service
percent
of
the
time
for

policies
mentioned
the
allocation
of
stations
represents
a
balance
between
protection
against
interference
and
the
provision
of
opportunity
for
an
adequate
number
of
stations
rules
and
policies
to
be
applied
in
this
process
of
course
must
be
based
on
objectives
which
represent
what
is
to
be
desired
if
radio
service
is
to
be
of
maximum
use
to
the
objectives
as
we
have
stated
many
times
are
provide
some
service
to
all
listeners
provide
as
many
choices
of
service
to
as
many
listeners
as
possible
provide
service
of
local
origin
to
as
many
listeners
as
possible
broadcast
frequencies
are
very
limited
in
number
these
objectives
are
to
some
extent
inconsistent
in
that
not
all
of
them
can
be
fully
realized
and
to
the
extent
that
each
is
realized
there
is
a
corresponding
reduction
of
the
possibilities
for
fullest
achievement
of
the
others
the
has
recognized
that
an
optimum
allocation
pattern
for
one
frequency
does
not
necessarily
represent
the
best
pattern
for
other
frequencies
and
has
assigned
different
frequencies
for
use
by
different
classes
of
stations
frequencies
are
assigned
for

primarily
by
dominant

to
operate
with
adequate

and
to
provide

both
groundwave
and
at

over
large
areas
and
at

distances
being
protected
against

to
the
degree
necessary
to
achieve
this
objective
dealing
with
these
frequencies
the
objective
listed

nighttime
operation
by

interference
which
is

respectively
stations
operating
generally
with
lower

the
allocation
pattern
worked
out
for
these
frequencies
the
provision
of
service
has
to
some
extent
been
subordinated
to
the
other
two
objectives
assignment
of
multiple
facilities
and
assignment
of
stations
in
as
many
communities
as
possible
mentioned
the
primary
allocation
objective
to
be
followed
in
the
allocation
of
stations
on
clear
channels
is
the
provision
of
widespread
service
free
from
destructive
interference
nighttime
hours
because
of
the
intense
skywave
propagation
then
prevailing
no
large
number
of
stations
can
be
permitted
to
operate
on
one
of
these
channels
if
the
wide
area
service
for
which
these
frequencies
are
assigned
is
to
be
rendered
satisfactorily
by
the
dominant
stations
which
must
be
relied
upon
to
render
it
under
our
longstanding
allocation
rules
on
some
of
these
channels
no
station
other
than
the
dominant
class
station
is
permitted
to
operate
at
night
so
that
the
station
can
render
service
interference
free
wherever
it
can
be
received
the
remainder
of
the
clear
channels
the
dominant
class
stations
are
protected
as
described
above
and
the
relatively
small
number
of
secondary
class
stations
permitted
to
operate
on
these
channels
at
night
are
required
to
operate
directionally
with
reduced
power
so
as
to
protect
the
class
stations
the
daytime
on
the
other
hand
since
skywave
transmission
is
relatively
inefficient
it
is
possible
to
assign
a
substantially
larger
number
of
stations
on
these
channels
class
assignments
for
daytime
operation
can
be
made
without
causing
destructive
interference
to
the
class
stations
or
to
each
other
and
by
their
operation
provide
additional
service
on
these
channels
and
additional
local
outlets
for
a
large
number
of
communities
additional
daytime
class
assignments
are
appropriate
if
optimum
use
is
to
be
made
of
these
frequencies
and
the
has
over
the
years
made
a
large
number
of
them
on
the
regional
channels
many
class
stations
have
been
assigned
either
to
operate
daytime
only
or
to
operate
nighttime
with
directional
antennas
lower
power
the
question
presented
for
decision
in
the
present
proceeding
is
whether
our
decision
in
to
assign
stations
on
the
basis
of
daytime
conditions
from
sunrise
to
sunset
is
sound
as
a
basis
for
allocations
or
whether
in
the
light
of
later
developments
and
new
understanding
skywave
transmission
is
of
such
significance
during
the
hours
immediately
before
sunset
and
after
sunrise
that
this
condition
should
be
taken
into
account
and
some
stations
required
to
afford
protection
to
other
stations
during
these
hours
history
of
the
proceeding
decision
reached
in
was
made
after
the
accumulation
of
a
large
amount
of
data
and
thorough
study
thereof
then
there
has
been
a
notable
increase
in
the
number
of
stations
and
also
the
accumulation
of
additional
data
and
the
development
of
new
techniques
for
using
it
leading
to
a
better
understanding
of
propagation
phenomena
affidavits
were
filed
with
the
by

example
out
of
the
social
evils
of
the
industrial

came
the
novels
of

his
genius
moved
his
readers
to
seek
solutions
of
those
evils
for
all

today
in

these
social

substantially
do
not

solutions
were
not
arrived
at
by
any
theoreticians
of
the
stripe
but
by
men
of
government
lawyers
most
of
them
and
men
of
business
were
educated
men
who
as
was
fond
of
saying
formed
their
inductions
out
of
experience
under
the
burden
of
responsibility
is
to
put
it
realistically
they
had
to
run
their
businesses
at
a
profit
or
they
had
to
get
the
votes
to
get
elected
they
made
naught
of
prophecy
that
capitalism
would
never
pay
the
workers
to
use
word
more
than
a
subsistence
wage
with
the
consequence
that
increased
productivity
must
inevitably
find
its
way
into
the
pockets
with
the
result
in
turn
that
the
gap
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
would
irrevocably
widen
and
the
misery
of
the
poor
increase
as
all
understand
who
have
eyes
to
see
nothing
of
the
kind
has
happened
indeed
the
contrary
has
happened
gulf
between
the
rich
and
the
poor
has
narrowed
in
the
industrialized
world
to
the
point
that
the
word
poor
is
hardly
applicable
the
reason
this
could
happen
is
clear
men
of
government
business
men
lawyers
and
all
who
concerned
themselves
with
the
welfare
of
their
fellow
men
did
not
let
their
concern
to
run
their
businesses
at
a
profit
restrict
the
development
of
freedom
and
opportunity
would
say
that
they
were
not
permitted
to
run
their
businesses
only
for
profit
and
even
putting
it
that
way
would
not
prove
that
was
anything
but
wrong
a
hundred
years
before

a
force
to
be
reckoned
with
wrote
his
brilliant
legal
generalization
that
the
progress
of
society
is
from
status
to
contract
essence
of
contract
is
that
one
is
free
to
make
a
choice
of
what
one
will
or
will
not
do
the

range

the
greater
the
range
of

the
greater
the
rate

the
possibilities
that
individual
men
glimpse
for
the
future
when
there
is
not
freedom
and
opportunity
to
choose

individual
men
must
remain
in
status
and
society
does
not
cannot
progress
eternal
truth
is
that
progress
due
as
it
always
is
to
individual
creative
genius
is
just
as
dependent
on
freedom
as
human
life
is
dependent
on
the
beating
of
the
heart
lest
anybody
think
that
considerations
such
as
these
are
not
germane
in
a
foundation
report
let
me
enlighten
them
with
the
truths
that
under
there
would
have
been
no
capital
with
which
to
endow

and
that
there
would
not
be

individual

unique

its
history
standing
astride

the
very
beginnings
of
the
industrial
revolution
has
become
over
the
years
a
singular
monument
to
the
mechanical
foresight
of
its
founder
and
a
synonym

precision

progress
in
metalworking
technology
grew
up
in
the
bustle
and
enterprise
of
between
and
was
early
exposed
to
the
mechanical
world
and
in
his
youth
often
helped
his
father
master
clock
and
watchmaker
as
he
plied
his
trade
the
age
of
he
became
an
apprentice
machinist
at
the
shop
of
in
and
following
two
or
three
other
jobs
in
quick
succession
after
graduation
he
went
into
business
for
himself
in
making
lathes
and
small
tools
enterprise
led
to
a
combination
beginning
in
under
the
name
a
business
which
eventually
grew
into
the
modern
corporation
we
now
call
years
of
partnership
with
his
father
were
numbered
a
devastating
fire
gutted
their
small
shop
and
soon
thereafter
moved
west
to
settling
on
a
land
grant
in
his
declining
years
continued
in
business
by
himself
quickly
rebuilding
the
establishment
which
had
been
lost
in
the
fire
and
beginning
those
first
steps
which
were
to
establish
him
as
a
pioneer
in
raising
the
standards
of
accuracy
of
machine
shop
practice
throughout
the
world
of
his
genius
of
course
sprang
from
his
familiarity
with
clock
movements
these
early
years
the
repair
of
watches
and
clocks
and
the
building
of
special
clocks
for
church
steeples
formed
an
important
part
of
the
young
occupation
became
particularly
interested
in
graduating
and
precision
measurement
during
the
and
his
thinking
along
these
lines
developed
considerably
during
this
period
his
business
also
grew
and
we
are
told
that
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
devote
as
much
time
to
his
creative
thinking
as
his
inclinations
led
him
to
desire
must
have
been
with
some
pleasure
and
relief
that
on
made
the
momentous
entry
in
his
job
book
in
his
characteristically
cryptic
style
came
to
work
for
me
this
day
as
an
apprentice
young
apprentice
apparently
did
well
by
for
in
the
third
year
of
his
apprenticeship
was
offered
a
full
partnership
in
the
firm
the
company
became
and
entered
into
a
new
and
important
period
of
its
development
arrival
in
the
business
did
indeed
provide
what
had
most
coveted
time
for
tinkering
and
the
opportunity
of
carrying
out
in
the
back
room
those
developments
in
precision
graduation
which
most
interested
him
at
that
time
the
new
partnership
announced
the
precision
vernier
caliper
as
the
first
fruit
of
their
joint
efforts
basic
significance
of
this
invention
helped
them
to
follow
it
rapidly
in
by
the
development
of
a
unique
precision
gear
cutting
and
dividing
engine
development
in
turn
formed
the
foundation
of
still
more
significant
expansions
in
later
years
in
gear
cutting
in
circular
graduating
in
index
drilling
and
in
many
other
fields
where
accuracy
was
a
paramount
requirement
their
careers
both
and
were
interested
in
the
problem
of
setting
up
standards
of
measurement
for
the
mechanical
trades
efforts
were
made
in
this
direction
and
though
not
all
of
them
survive
to
this
day
the
wire
gage
system
was
eventually
adopted
as
the
standard
and
is
still
in
common
use
today
one
development
followed
another
the
reputation
for
precision
in
the
graduating
field
brought
it
broader
and
broader
opportunities
for
expansion
in
precision
manufacture
the
partnership
began

the
sewing
machine
the
story
goes
who
originally
came
from
the
back
counties
of
the
of
saw
an
illustration
in
a
magazine
of
the
famous
sewing
machine
as
to
what
made
it
work
he
built
a
crude
model
of
it
in
wood
and
filed
a
piece
of
steel
until
he
succeeded
in
making
a
metal
pickup
for
the
thread
enabling
the
crude
machine
to
take
stitches
he
showed
this
model
as
his
solution
as
to
how
the
sewing
machine
operated
he
was
told
he
was
wrong
and
discovered
to
his
amazement
that
the
which
was
unknown
to
him
in
detail
used
two
threads
while
the
one
that
he
had
perfected
used
only
one
was
invented
the
single
thread
sewing
machine
which
in
partnership
with
decided
to
bring
to
with
the
proposal
that
the
small
company
undertake
its
manufacture
new
work
was
a
boon
to
the
partnership
not
only
for
its
own
value
but
particularly
for
the
stimulation
it
provided
to
the
imagination
of
toward
yet
further
developments
for
production
equipment
turret
screw
machine
now
known
as
the
hand
screw
machine
takes
its
ancestry
directly
from
efforts
to
introduce
equipment
to
simplify
the
manufacture
of
the
sewing
machine
made
important
additions
to
the
arts
in
screw
machine
design
by
drastically
improving
the
means
for
revolving
the
turret
by
introducing
automatic
feeding
devices
for
the
stock
and
reversible
tap
and
die
holders
attention
was
called
to
yet
another
basic
production
problem
the
manufacture
of
twist
drills
that
time
during
the
muskets
were
being
manufactured
in
and
the
drills
to
drill
them
were
being
with
rattail
files
process
neither
satisfied
the
urgent
production
schedules
nor
imagination
of
the
possibilities
in
the
situation
child
of
this
problem
was
famous
the
archtype
from
which
is
descended
universal
milling
machine
used
throughout
the
world
original
machine
bearing
its
famous
serial
number
is
still
on
exhibition
at
the
in
the
period
also
invented
the
formed
tooth
gear
cutter
a
basic
invention
which
ultimately
revolutionized
the
gear
manufacturing
industry
by
changing
its
basic
economics
until
that
time
it
had
been
possible
to
make
cutters
for
making
gear
teeth
but
they
were
good
for
only
one
sharpening
soon
as
the
time
came
for
the
precise
form
of
the
gear
tooth
was
lost
and
a
new
cutter
had
to
be
made
process
made
the
economical
manufacture
of
gears
questionable
until
some
way
could
be
found
to
permit
the
repeated
of
gear
tooth
cutters
without
the
loss
of
the
precision
form
invention
achieved
this
and
as
a
byproduct
formed
the
cornerstone
of
position
of
leadership
in
the
gear
making
equipment

which
lasted
until
the
when

by
other
methods

a
common
workshop
tool
also
owes
much
to
was
not
himself
its
inventor
it
was
a
idea
it
is
typical
that
his
intuition
first
conceived
the
importance
of
mass
producing
this
basic
tool
for
general
use
it
was
that
when
and
first
saw
the
tool
on
exhibition
in
in
they
brought
a
sample
with
them
to
the
and
started
in
yet
another
field
where
it
retains
its
leadership
to
this
day
final
achievement
of
long
and
interesting
mechanical
career
runs
a
close
second
in
importance
to
his
development
of
the
universal
milling
machine
achievement
was
his
creation
of
the
universal
grinding
machine
which
made
its
appearance
in
at
the
machine
like
its
milling
counterpart
was
the
antecedent
of
a
used
to
this
very
day
in
precision
metalworking
shops
throughout
the
world
with
other
major
developments
the
universal
grinding
machine
was
profoundly
influential
in
setting
the
course
of
for
many
years
to
come

there
came
forward
in
the
organization
many
other
men
who
contributed
greatly
to
the
development
of
the
company
such
man

of
the

began
by
challenging
to
its
keenest
competition
during
the

early
however
a
truce
was
called
between
the
companies
and
the
partnership
of
was
formed
that
year
and
the
buying
out
of
interest
in
a
large
portion
of
the
precision
tool
business
was
carried
out
under
the
name
of

to
this
day
many
old
precision
tools
are
in
use
still
bearing
that
famous
trademark
the
outstanding
standard

of
tradition
for
accuracy
was
whose
mechanical
genius
closely
paralleled
that
of

whose
particular
forte
was
the
development
of
the
exceedingly
accurate
measuring
machinery
that
enabled
to
manufacture

an
accuracy
exceeding

sense
it
can
be
said
that
one

spite
of
the
fact
that
our

was
affected
substantially
by
the
current
decline
in

activity
we
have
been
able
to
produce

position
of

lends
support
to

to
charge
off

could
if
adopted
have
favorable
effects
on

in
the
next
few
years
a

would
also
we
believe
prove
a
very
important
factor
in
strengthening

we
believe
it
must
concentrate
on
the
development
of
entirely
new
concepts
in

as
do
the

and
our
more
recent

increased
this
basis
our
already
substantial
budget
for

been
further
increased

by
the
recent
months
much
attention
has
been
given
to
the
probable
extent
of
the
current
downtrend
in
business
and
economists
are
somewhat
divided
as
to
the
outlook
for
the
near
future
yet
despite
some
disappointment
with
the
performance
of
this
first
year
of
the
new
decade
has
been
a
good
year
in
many
ways
with
many
overall
measures
of
business
having
reached
new
peaks
for
the
year
as
a
whole
shift
in
sentiment
from
excessive
optimism
early
in
the
year
to
the
present
mood
of
caution
has
probably
been
a
good
thing
in
that
it
has
prevented
the
accumulation
of
the
burdensome
inventories
that
have
characterized
many
previous
swings
in
the
business
cycle
caution
has
been
particularly
noticeable
in
a
tendency
of
retailers
and
distributors
to
shift
the
inventory
burden
back
on
the
supplier
and
the
fact
stocks
at
retail
are
low
in
many
lines
has
escaped
attention
because
of
the
presence
of
higher
stocks
at
the
manufacturing
level
the
electronics
industry
this
tendency
is
well
illustrated
by
inventories
of
sets
stocks
in
recent
months
have
been
the
highest
they
have
been
in
three
years
while
those
at
retail
are
below
total
value
of
our
shipments
at
factory
prices
increased
from
billion
in
to
approximately
billion
as
a
result
of
increases
in
all
of
the
major
segments
of
our
business
home
entertainment
military
industrial
and
replacement
believe
a
further
gain
is
in
prospect
for
entertainment
sales
up
the
largest
percentage
of
sets
such
as
consoles
and
combinations
since
dollar
value
of
home
entertainment
electronics
in
was
about
billion
compared
to
billion
in
of
sets
at
retail
ran
ahead
of
the
like
months
of
through
set
production
excluding
those
destined
for
the
export
market
also
ran
ahead
in
the
early
months
but
was
curtailed
after
the
usual
vacation
shutdowns
in
the
face
of
growing
evidence
that
some
of
the
early
production
plans
had
been
overly
optimistic
the
year
as
a
whole
retail
sales
of
sets
probably
came
to
million
against
million
in
however
production
came
to
only
million
compared
to
million
contrast
to
the
lower
turnout
of
total
radio
production
increased
from
million
sets
to
million
excluding
export
home
and
auto
radios
were
in
excellent
demand
with
retail
sales
of
home
sets
ahead
of
in
every
month
of
the
first
eleven
sales
and
production
of
home
sets
were
about
equal
at
million
units
set
production
came
to
about
million
compared
to
million
in
phonographs
also
had
a
good
year
reflecting
the
growing
popularity
of
stereo
sound
and
the
same
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
consumer
to
upgrade
that
characterized
the
market
outlook
for
entertainment
electronics
in
is
certainly
far
from
clear
at
present
but
recent
surveys
have
shown
a
desire
on
the
part
of
consumers
to
step
up
their
buying
plans
for
durable
goods
would
expect
that
sales
at
retail
in
the
first
half
of
might
be
below
by
some
but
that
levels
should
show
a
favorable
comparison
with
a
possibility
of
quite
strong
demand
late
in
the
year
if
business
conditions
recover
as
some
recent
forecasts
suggest
they
will
look
for
sales
and
production
to
be
approximately
equal
at
million
sets
for
the
year
but
look
for
some
decline
in
radios
from
the
high
rate
in
to
more
nearly
the
level
of
million
sets
therefore
believe
it
is
realistic
to
assume
a
modest
drop
in
the
total
value
of
home
entertainment
electronics
to
about
million
slightly
below
but
above
electronics
to
grow
witnessed
another
substantial
increase
in
our
shipments
of
military
electronics
which
totalled
about
billion
compared
to
billion
in
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
present
level
of
military
electronics
procurement
is
greater
than
the
total
sales
to
all
markets
in
which
were
good
years
for
our
industry
with
television
enjoying
its
initial
period
of
rapid
consumer
acceptance
has
been
correctly
pointed
out
by
people
in
the
industry
that
it
is
probably
unrealistic
to
expect
a
continuation
of
the
yearly
growth
of
or
better
that
characterized
the
decade
of
the
and
that
our
military
markets
may
be
entering
upon
a
new
phase
in
which
procurement
of
multiple
weapons
systems
will
give
way
to
concentration
of
still
undeveloped
areas
of
our
defense
capability
this
may
well
be
true
in
general
believe
it
is
also
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
some
recent
developments
suggest
that
over
the
next
year
or
so
military
electronics
may
be
one
of
the
most
strongly
growing
areas
in
an
economy
which
is
not
expanding
rapidly
in
other
directions
the
items
scheduled
for
acceleration
in
the
near
future
are
the
and
programs
strengthening
of
the
airborne
alert
system
of
the
and
improved
battlefield
surveillance
systems
and
development
expenditures
connected
with
the
reconnaissance
satellite
and
the
future
development
of
ballistic
missile
defense
systems
such
as
are
expected
to
increase
substantially
development
test
and
evaluation
funds
devoted
to
missiles
in
were
to
times
as
large
as
those
devoted
to
aircraft
and
actual
missile
procurement
is
expected
to
exceed
aircraft
procurement
by
later
the
realm
of
space
technology
will
show
substantial
gains
it
has
been
estimated
that
spending
by
the
and
will
rise
from
less
than
million
in
fiscal
to
more
than
billion
by
and
that
the
electronic
share
of
these
expenditures
will
be
closer
to
than
the
current
defense
procurement
called
for
in
the
has
already
begun
to
make
itself
felt
in
an
upturn
in
orders
for
military
electronic
equipment
and
the
components
that
go
into
it
and
it
has
been
suggested
that
an
additional
billion
increase
in
total
defense
spending
may
be
requested
for
fiscal
the
impact
of
these
increases
on
our
shipments
will
be
gradual
on
balance
look
for
another
good
increase
in
shipments
in
the
coming
year
to
at
least
billion
electronic
equipment
by
the
continuing
rapid
growth
of
electronic
data
processing
sales
of
industrial
and
commercial
electronic
equipment
totalled
billion
compared
to
billion
in
market
for
computers
and
other
continues
to
expand
at
the
rate
of
about
annually
reaching
some
million
in
estimates
look
for
this
market
to
approximately
quadruple
by
the

be
realized
that
the

is
somewhat
more
sensitive

conditions
than
is
the
military

for
this
reason
would
expect
that
any

be
somewhat
smaller

these
duties
fit
neatly
with
those
of
the
proposed
presidential
aide
one
person
with
adequate
staff
assistance
could
fill
both
jobs
faculty
see
themselves
as
professionals
rather
than
as
employees
enthusiasm
in
a
common
enterprise
is
proportionate
to
the
sense
of
ownership
they
have
in

by
virtue

decisions
that

course
faculty
believes
that
broad
autonomy
is
necessary
to
preserve

freedom

scholarship
president
expects
faculty
members
to
remember
in
exercising
their
autonomy
that
they
share
no
collective
responsibility
for
the
income
nor
are
they
personally
accountable

decisions
may
welcome
their
appropriate
participation
in
the
determination
of

he
has
a
right
to
expect
in
return
that
they
will
leave
administrative
matters
to
the
administration
well
do
faculty
members
govern
themselves
is
little
evidence
that
they
are
giving
any
systematic
thought
to
a
general
theory
of
the
optimum
scope
and
nature
of
their
part
in
government
sometimes
pay
more
attention
to
their
rights
than
to
their
own
internal
problems
of
government
too
need
to
learn
to
delegate
the
administration
take
details
off
their
hands
would
give
them
more
time
to
inform
themselves
about
education
as
a
whole
an
area
that
would
benefit
by
more
faculty
attention
faculties
insist
on
governing
themselves
they
grant
little
prestige
to
a
member
who
actively
participates
in
college
or
university
government
are
nevertheless
several
things
that
the
president
can
do
to
stimulate
participation
and
to
enhance
the
prestige
of
those
who
are
willing
to
exercise
their
privilege
can
for
example
present
significant
issues
to
the
senate
can
encourage
quality
in
faculty
committee
work
in
various
ways
by
seeing
to
it
that
the
membership
of
each
committee
represents
the
thoughtful
as
well
as
the
faculty
by
making
certain
that
no
faculty
member
has
too
many
committee
assignments
by
assuring
good
liaison
between
the
committees
and
the
administration
by
minimizing
the
number
of
committees
the
many
avenues
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
between
faculty
and
administration
complaints
of
a
lack
of
communication
persist
cause
is
as
often
neglect
as
hesitance
to
disclose
busy
president
conversant
with
a
problem
and
its
ramifications
and
beset
by
pressures
to
meet
deadlines
tends
naturally
to
assume
that
others
must
be
as
familiar
with
a
problem
as
he
is
need
for
interchange
and
understanding
makes
vital
the
full
use
of
all
methods
of
consultation
increase
faculty
influence
and
decrease
tension
many
presidents
have
established
a
standing
advisory
committee
with
which
they
can
discuss
problems
frankly
president
has
little
influence
in
curricular
changes
but
if
he
looks
ahead
two
three
or
five
years
to
anticipate
issues
and
throw
out
challenging
ideas
he
can
open
the
way
for
innovation
and
he
can
also
have
a
great
deal
to
say
as
to
what
path
it
will
take
will
require
tact
sensitivity
to
faculty
prerogatives
patience
and
persistence
critical
task
for
every
president
and
his
academic
administrative
staff
is
to
assure
that
the
college
or
university
continually
rebuilds
and
regenerates
itself
so
that
its
performance
will
match
changing
social
demands
professors
do
not
automatically
reproduce
themselves
can
form
an
important
bridge
between
the
president
and
the
faculty
serve
not
only
as
spokesmen
for
their
areas
but
they
also
contribute
to
decision
making
president
who
appoints
strong
men
who
have
an
or
university
point
of
view
and
a
talent
and
respect
for
administration
can
count
on
useful
assistance
members
depend
on
their
department
chairmen
to
promote
their
interests
with
the
administration
administration
at
the
same
time
looks
to
the
chairmen
for
strategic
aid
in
building
stronger
departments
way
that
this
can
be
done
other
than
by
hiring
new
professors
is
by
constantly
encouraging
the
department
members
to
raise
their
standards
of
performance
quality
of
a
leadership
is
measured
first
by
his
success
in
building
up
the
faculty
supporting
the
efforts
of
the
many
faculty
members
who
are
working
to
attain
ever
higher
standards
the
president
can
encourage
faculty
leadership
he
can
best
help
them
by
insuring
that
rigorous
criteria
for
appointment
and
promotion
are
clearly
set
forth

adhered

the

universities
a

committee
reviews
and
reports
to
the
administration
on
the
qualifications
of
candidates
faculty
members
and
many
administrators
oppose
faculty
review
groups
because
they
either
repeat
actions
or
act
pro

be
effective
however
if
their

set
high

and
devote
substantial

to

cites
the
faculty

committee
as
a
valued
partner
of
the
administration
in
guarding
and
promoting
the
quality
of
the
faculty
the

candidate
to
the
trustees
the
administration
collects
the
views
of
colleagues
in
the
same
field
of
knowledge
on

elsewhere
president
or
dean
reads
some
of
his
publications
to
form
the
truest
possible
evaluation
of
the
quality
of
his
mind
good
way
to
evaluate
teaching
ability
has
yet
been
discovered
although
some
institutions
use
inventory
sheets
for
a
list
of
criteria
avoid
passing
over
quiet
unaggressive
teachers
as
well
as
to
decide
whether
others
merit
promotion
review
of
the
right
of
faculty
members
to
promotion
or
salary
increases
should
be
made
periodically
whether
or
not
they
have
been
recommended
for
advancement
by
their
departments
are
certain
aspects
of
personnel
development
in
which
a
president
must
involve
himself
directly
should
personally
consider
the
potential
of
a
faculty
member
proposed
for
tenure
to
guard
against
the
mistake
of
making
this
profoundly
serious
commitment
turn
solely
upon
the
former
achievements
one
can
be
as
effective
as
the
president
in
inspiring
older
men
to
welcome
imaginative
new
teachers
whose
philosophy
or
approach
to
their
specialties
is
quite
different
particular
the
president
may
have
to
summon
all
his
oratorical
powers
to
persuade
department
members
to
accept
an
outstanding
man
above
the
normal
salary
scale
those
rare
occasions
when
a
faculty
member
on
tenure
is
not
meeting
the
standards
of
the
institution
the
president
must
also
bear
the
ultimate
burden
of
decision
and
action
true
university
like
most
successful
marriages
is
a
unity
of
diversities
forcing
all
components
into
a
single
pattern
the
preparation
of
a
master
plan
is
an
opportunity
to
consider
interrelation
of
knowledge
at
its
highest
level
which
a
university
in
contrast
to
a
multiversity
should
stand
for
colleges

universities

begun
to
translate
their
educational
philosophy

a

more
institutions
are

five
years
the

offers
several

advantages
faculty

can
consider
the
consequences
of
decisions
before
they
are
made

of
afterwards

can
be
efficiently
developed
new
programs
can
be
examined
for
appropriateness
to
goals
and
for
present

future
financial
fitness
than
one
president
has
found
that
a
plan
helps
him
to
attract
major
gifts
inspires
confidence
in
his
determination

establish

one
of
their

chances

the

of
the
elements

do
much
to
free
a
president
for
his

offer
many
potent
intangible
attractions
to
members
of
the

community
that
will

differences

president
is
frequently
besieged
to
serve
in
civic
and
governmental
capacities
to
make
speeches
to
lay
groups
and
to
make
numerous
ceremonial
appearances
on
and
off

he
can
neither
accept
nor
reject
them
all
he
must
be
governed
by
the
time
and
energy
available
for
his
prime
professional
obligations
and
substitutions
are
better
received
when
he
explains
why
his
obligations
to
his
institution
preclude
his
acceptance
sharing
the
load
of
important
speeches
with
his
colleagues
the
president
can
develop
a
cadre
of
able
spokesmen
who
will
help
to
create
a
public
perception
of
the
university
as
an
institution
something
more
than
the
lengthened
shadow
of
one
man
has
recently
become
practical
to
use
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
as
a
new
source
of
information
about
these
bodies
and
their
atmospheres
results
of
present
observations
of
the
thermal
radio
emission
of
the
moon
are
consistent
with
the
very
low
thermal
conductivity
of
the
surface
layer
which
was
derived
from
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
during
eclipses
sufficiently
accurate
and
complete
measurements
are
available
it
will
be
possible
to
set
limits
on
the
thermal
and
electrical
characteristics
of
the
surface
and
subsurface
materials
of
the
moon
of
the
radio
emission
of
a
planet
which

an
extensive
atmosphere
will
probe
the
atmosphere
to
a
greater
extent
than
those

shorter
wave
lengths

otherwise
unobtainable

planets
observed
intensity
of
the
radio
emission
of
is
much
higher
than
the
expected
thermal
intensity
although
the
spectrum
indicated
by
measurements
at
wave
lengths
near
cm
and
cm
is
like
that
of
a
black
body
at
about
result
suggests
a
very
high
temperature
at
the
solid
surface
of
the
planet
although
there
is
the
possibility
that
the
observed
radiation
may
be
a
combination
of
both
thermal
and
components
and
that
the
observed
spectrum
is
that
of
a
black
body
merely
by
coincidence
the
case
of
the
radio
emission
spectrum
is
definitely
not
like
the
spectrum
of
a
radiator
and
it
seems
very
likely
that
the
radiation
reaching
the
earth
is
a
combination
of
thermal
radiation
from
the
atmosphere
and
components
the
remaining
planets
only
and
have
been
observed
as
radio
sources
and
not
very
much
information
is
available
has
been
observed
twice
at
about
wave
length
and
the
intensity
of
the
observed
radiation
is
in
reasonable
agreement
with
the
thermal
radiation
which
might
be
predicted
on
the
basis
of
the
known
temperature
of
low
intensity
of
the
radiation
from
has
limited
observations
but
again
the
measured
radiation
seems
to
be
consistent
with
a
thermal
origin
attempts
to
measure
the
radio
emission
of
the
remaining
planets
have
been
reported
and
because
of
their
distances
small
diameters
or
low
temperatures
the
thermal
radiation
at
radio
wave
lengths
reaching
the
earth
from
these
sources
is
expected
to
be
of
very
low
intensity
spite
of
this
the
very
large
radio
reflectors
and
improved
amplifying
techniques
which
are
now
becoming
available
should
make
it
possible
to
observe
the
radio
emission
of
most
of
the
planets
in
a
few
years
study
of
the
radio
emission
of
the
moon
and
planets
began
with
the
detection
of
the
thermal
radiation
of
the
moon
at
wave
length
by
and
was
followed
by
a
comprehensive
series
of
observations
of
the
emission
of
the
moon
over
three
lunar
cycles
by
and
deduced
from
their
measurements
that
the
radio
emission
from
the
whole
disk
of
the
moon
varied
during
a
lunation
in
a
roughly
sinusoidal
fashion
that
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
was
considerably
less
than
the
amplitude
of
the
variation
in
the
infrared
emission
as
measured
by
and
and
and
that
the
maximum
of
the
radio
emission
came
about
days
after
which
is
again
in
contrast
to
the
infrared
emission
which
reaches
its
maximum
at
and
explained
their
observations
by
pointing
out
that
rocklike
materials
which
are
likely
to
make
up
the
surface
of
the
moon
would
be
partially
transparent
to
radio
waves
although
opaque
to
infrared
radiation
infrared
emission
could
then
be
assumed
to
originate
at
the
surface
of
the
moon
while
the
radio
emission
originates
at
some
depth
beneath
the
surface
where
the
temperature
variation
due
to
solar
radiation
is
reduced
in
amplitude
and
shifted
in
phase
the
absorption
of
radio
waves
in
rocklike
material
varies
with
wave
length
it
should
be
possible
to
sample
the
temperature
variation
at
different
depths
beneath
the
surface
and
possibly
detect
changes
in
the
structure
or
composition
of
the
lunar
surface
material
radio
emission
of
a
planet
was
first
detected
in

and
identified
the
origin
of

on
their

at
about

for
the
determination
of
the

this
together
with

account
for

of
the

in

contour
diagrams
have
been
made
of
the

that
the

to
be
an
exception

it

the

that
the

built
up

if
measurements

back

introduced

the

indicated

actual

because
the

beyond
the

of
the

two
fluids
which
gave
the

polybutenes

molecular

which
were
stated
to
be

are
fluids

with

is
presumed
that
this

was
associated
with
some
geometric
factor
of
the

since
different

were
obtained
with
the

the
only
apparent
difference
was
the

this
is
not

elasticity

a

of

at

it
is
a
parameter

to

at

actual

calculated
by
multiplying
the

times
the

as
it

the

is
the

then
is
obtained
on
a

which
is
the
customary
terminology
of
the
chemists
the
calculation
is
obvious
by
analogy
with
that
for
gravitational
field
and
osmotic

it
is
interesting
to
confirm
it
by
a
method
which
can
be
generalized
to
include
related
effects
a

the

development
we
have
applied
the
thermodynamics
of

referred
to
by
some
as

can
be
justified
thermodynamically
in
this
case
and
this
will
be
done
in
a

an
interesting
analogy
with
the
assumption
stated
by
that
the
deformational
mechanics
of
elastic
solids
can
be
applied
to
flowing
solutions
is
one
exception
to
the
above
statement
as
has
been
pointed
out
and
that
is
that
fluids
can
relax
by
flowing
into
fields
of
lower
rates
of
shear
so
the
statement
should
be
modified
by
stating
that
the
mechanics
are
similar
the
mechanics
are
similar
we
can
also
infer
that
the

will
also
be
similar
concept
of
the

energy
as
a

and
exerting

normal
to

face
is
compatible
with
the
information
obtained
from
optical
birefringence
studies
of
fluids
undergoing
shear
these
birefringence
studies
show
that
at
low
rates
of
shear
a
tension
is
present
at
to
the
direction
of
shear
and
as
the
rate
of
shear
increases
the
direction
of
the
maximum
tension
moves
asymptotically
toward
the
direction
of
shear
to
the
recoverable
shear
is
given
by
where
is
the
angle
of
extinction
this
and
the
force
of
deformation
it
should
be
possible
to
calculate
the
elastic
energy
of
deformation
which
should
be
equal
to
the
calculated
from
the
pressure
normal
to
the
shearing
face

another
means
which
should
show
the
direction

of
the

the
conclusions
will
be
a

given
by
the

and
both
show
that
the

of
the

is
at
at
low
rates

and
that
it
approaches
the

up
before
they
are
near
to

a

a
tremendous
influence
on
the
magnetic

properties
of
nuclei
is
important
to
consider
and
experimentally
verify
this
influence
since
quantitative
nuclear
resonance
is
becoming
increasingly
used
in
investigations
of
structure
appeared
to
be
well
suited
for
the
study
of
these
matters
since
it
is
a
normal
paramagnet
with
three
unpaired
electrons
on
the
chromium
its
crystal
structure
is
very
simple
and
the
unknown
position
of
the
hydrogen
in
the
strong
bond
provides
structural
interest
first
discuss
the

then
outline
the
theory
of
the
interaction
of
paramagnetic
dipoles
with

and
show
that
the
theory
is
in
excellent
agreement
with
experiment
it
is
possible
to
separate
electron
paramagnetic
from
nuclear
effects
information
provided
by
the
electron

is
then
discussed
and
finally
the
nuclear
effects
are
interpreted
in
terms
of
various
models
of

in
studies
of
the

generally
agree
that
the

will
be
linear
in
the
absence
of

of
packing
in
the
solid
it
will
be
asymmetric
until
a
certain
critical
distance
is
reached
below
which
it
will
become
symmetric
is
ample
evidence
from
many
sources
that
the

in
is
symmetric
distance

is
evidence
though
less
convincing
than
for
that
the

in
nickel
dimethylglyoxime
is
symmetric
the
distance
is
number
of
semiempirical
estimates
by
various
workers
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the

becomes
symmetric
when
the

is
about

aside
from
the
possible

then
the
possibility
that
this

is

to
determine
its

from
his

to
be

permit
to

the

but
a
negative
test
for
piezoelectricity
led
him
to
assume
a
center
of

this
assumption
the

must
be

the
following
are
the

found

to

best
for

lead
to
a
structure
in
which
sheets
of
atoms
lie
between
two
sheets
of
atoms
atoms
in
each
sheet
are
close
packed
and
each
atom
is
surrounded
by
a
distorted
octahedron
of
atoms
layers
are
stacked
normal
to
the
axis
with
the
lower
oxygens
of
one
layer
directly
above
the
upper
oxygens
of
the
neighboring
lower
layer
in
such
a
manner
that
the
repeat
is
every

are
joined
together
by
hydrogen

drawing
of
the
structure
is
to
be
found
in

gross
details
of
the
structure
appear
reasonable
structure
appears
to
be
unique
among
compounds
but
is
the
same
as
that
assumed
by
bond
angles
and
distances
are
all
within
the
expected
limits
and
the
volume
per
oxygen
is
about
normal
the
possible
absence
of
a
center
of
symmetry
not
only
moves
the
hydrogen
atom
off
but
also
allows
the
oxygen
atoms
to
become
nonequivalent
with
at
and
at
space
group
where
represents
the
oxygens
on
one
side
of
the
layers
and
those
on
the
other
side
any
oxygen
nonequivalence
would
shorten
either
the
already
extremely
short
interlayer
distance
of
or
the
interlayer
interactions
which
are
already
quite
short
at
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
packing
of
the
atoms
in
this
material
in
which
the
oxygen
atoms
are
far
from
geometrical
equivalence
only
effect
of
lack
of
a
center
would
then
be
to
release
the
hydrogen
atoms
to
occupy
general
rather
than
special
positions
along
the
axis
the
bond
is
linear
then
there
are
three
reasonable
positions
for
the
hydrogen
atoms
hydrogen
atoms
are
centered
and
hence
all
lie
on
a
sheet
midway
between
the
oxygen
sheets
all
hydrogen
atoms
lie
on
a
sheet
but
the
sheet
is
closer
to
one
oxygen
sheet
than
to
the
other
hydrogen
atoms
are
asymmetrically
placed
either
randomly
or
in
an
ordered
way
so
that
some
hydrogen
atoms
are
closer
to
the
upper
oxygen
atoms
while
others
are
closer
to
the
lower
oxygen
atoms
appears
to
us
to
be
unlikely
in
view
of
the
absence
of
a
piezoelectric
effect
and
on
general
chemical
structural
grounds
randomization
of
ups
and
downs
is
more
likely
than
ordered
ups
and
downs
in
position
since
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
well
separated
and
so
the
position
of
one
could
hardly
affect
the
position
of
another
and
also
since
ordered
up
and
down
implies
a
larger
unit
cell
for
which
no
evidence
exists
the
only
unknown
structural
feature
would
appear
to
be
whether
the
hydrogen
atoms
are
located
symmetrically
or
asymmetrically

best
demonstrated
by
practical

importance
of
the
inorganic

in
cleaning
has
been
emphasized
in
a
number
of
papers
chemistry
of
washing
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
process
of
washing
fabrics
involves
a
number
of
phenomena
which
are
related
together
in
an
extremely
complicated
way
and
that
these
phenomena
and
their
interrelations
are
not
well
understood
at
the
present
this
section
attempts
to
present
briefly
an
picture
of
the
physical
chemistry
of
washing
either
fabrics
or
hard
surfaces
purpose
of
washing
is
obviously
to
remove
soils
which
are
arbitrarily
classed
in
the
four
major
categories
given
below
which
is
here
defined
as
particulate
material
which
is
usually
inorganic
and
is
very
often
extremely
finely
divided
so
as
to
exhibit
colloidal
properties
soils
which
are
typified
by
hydrocarbons
and
fats
esters
of
glycerol
with
organic
acids
which
include
the
wide
variety
of
nonparticulate
materials
which
give
color
even
when
present
in
very
low
concentration
on
the
soiled
object
soils
which
primarily
include
sticky
substances
and
colorless
liquids
which
evaporate
to
leave
a
residue
dirt
on
the
soiled
objects
is
mechanically
held
by
surface
irregularities
to
some
extent
a
major
factor
in
binding
dirt
is
the
attraction
between
surfaces
that
goes
under
the
name
of
der
forces
is
a
theoretically
complicated
dipole
interaction
which
causes
any
extremely
small
uncharged
particle
to
agglomerate
with
other
small
uncharged
particles
or
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
if
colloidal
particles
bear
charges
of
opposite
sign
or
if
one
kind
is
charged
and
the
other
kind
is
not
the
attraction
will
be
intensified
and
the
tendency
to
agglomerate
will
be
greatly
reinforced
a
charged
particle
will
tend
to
stick
to
an
uncharged
surface
and
vice
versa
and
a
charged
particle
will
be
very
strongly
attracted
to
a
surface
exhibiting
an
opposite
charge
addition
dirt
particles
can
be
held
onto
a
soiled
surface
by
sticky
substances
or
by
the
surface
tension
of
liquids
including
liquid
greases
stains
and
miscellaneous
soils
are
usually
sorbed
onto
the
soiled
surface
most
cases
these
soils
are
taken
up
as
liquids
through
capillary
action
an
essentially
static
system
an
oil
cannot
be
replaced
by
water
on
a
surface

detergent

belong
to
the
chemical
class
consisting
of

and
highly
polar
molecules
which
exhibit
the
property
of
forming
micelles
in

investigations
of
anionic

have
shown
that
there

these

is
the
technologically
important
ability
of

actives
to
congregate
at

in
such
a
manner
that
the

of

is
directed
towards
the

the

become
coated
in
this
manner
with
an

the

rolls
back
at

so
that

can
disengage
themselves
from

of

and
enter

a
substance
which
is
permanently
or
temporarily
sorbed
on
the
surface
in
place
of
the
soil
will
tend
to
accelerate
this
process
and
effectively
push
off
the

other
than
detergent
actives
also
tend
to
be
strongly
sorbed
from
aqueous
media
onto

of
other
contiguous

is
particularly
true
of
highly
charged

those
ions
which
fall
into
the
class
of
polyelectrolytes
the

strongly
sorbed

the

are
most
strongly
sorbed
at

between

exhibiting
an
ionic
structure
see
on
for
aqueous

we
can
think
of
the
idealized
organic
active
as
an
oleophilic
or
hydrophobic
agent
and
of
an
idealized
builder
as
a
oleophobic
or
hydrophilic
agent
the
equilibrium
sorption
data
which
are
available
it
seems
logical
to
expect
that
polyphosphate
ions
would
be
strongly
sorbed
on
the
surface
of
the
dirt
especially
clay
soils
so
as
to
give
it
a
greatly
increased
negative
charge
charged
particles
then
repel
each
other
and
are
also
repelled
from
the
charged
surface
which
almost
invariably
bears
a
negative

under
washing
conditions
negatively
charged

particles
then
leave
the

and
go
into
the

hypothesis
is
evolved
in
analogy
to
the
demonstrated
action
of
organic

in
detergency
does
not
consider
the
kinetic
effects
of
the

on
phenomena
which
will
be
discussed
later
see
crude
picture
of
the

process
thus
far
developed
can
be
represented
as

of

be

is
evident
that
the
requirements
imposed
by
these
effects
upon
any
one
detergent
constituent
acting
alone
are
severe
consideration
of
the
variety
of
soils

normally
encountered
in
the

it
is
little
wonder
that
the
use
of
a

gained
widespread
acceptance

is
difficult
to

indeed
there
is
no
more
reason
to
separate
the

question
of
epidemic
disease
merits
some
discussion
a
limited
effort
has
been
devoted
to
this
problem
of
those
who
question
the
value
of
have
assumed
that
the
only
potential
would
be
in
the
establishment
of
epidemics
then
point
out
that
with
our
present
lack
of
knowledge
of
all
the
factors
concerned
in
the
rise
and
fall
of
epidemics
it
is
unlikely
that
a
planned
episode
could
be
initiated
argue
further
and
somewhat
contradictorily
that
our
knowledge
and
resources
in
preventive
medicine
would
make
it
possible
to
control
such
an
outbreak
of
disease
is
why
this
approach
to
defense
has
not
been
given
major
attention
major
problem
is
what
an
enemy
might
accomplish
in
an
initial
attack
on
a
target
of
course
does
not
eliminate
from
consideration
for
this
purpose
agents
that
are
associated
naturally
with
epidemic
disease
hypothetical
example
will
illustrate
this
point
us
assume
that
it
would
be
possible
for
an
enemy
to
create
an
aerosol
of
the
causative
agent
of
epidemic
typhus
prowazwki
over
and
that
a
large
number
of
cases
of
typhus
fever
resulted
therefrom
epidemic
was
initiated
nor
was
one
expected
because
the
population
in
was
not
lousy
is
a
prerequisite
for
epidemic
typhus
this
case
then
the
military
objective
was
accomplished
with
an
epidemic
agent
solely
through
the
results
secured
in
the
initial
attack
was
done
with
full
knowledge
that
there
would
be
no
epidemic
the
other
hand
a
similar
attack
might
have
been
made
on
whose
population
was
known
to
be
lousy
might
expect
some
spread
of
the
disease
in
this
case
resulting
in
increased
effectiveness
of
the
attack
major
defensive
problems
are
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
overt
military
delivery
of

from

devices
should
be
no
more
difficult
to
deliver
such
devices
than
other

delivery
vehicles
whether
they
be
airplanes
submarines
or
guided
missiles
should
be
usable
it
is
possible
for
an
enemy
to
put
an
atomic
bomb
on
a
city
it
should
be
equally
possible
to
put
a
cloud
of

over
that

agents
are
moreover

for

she
has
fixed
up
for

she
woke

from
her
winter
sleep
befits
a
queen
a
bumblebee
female
is
rather
choosy
and
may
spend
considerable
time
searching
for
a
suitable
nesting
place
species
seem
to
prefer
a
hollow
such
as
a
deserted

a
bird

or
the
hole
made
by
a
woodpecker
some
show
a
definite
liking
for
making
their
nest
in
moss
she
has
made
up
her
mind
the
queen
starts
out
by
constructing
in
her
chosen
abode
a
small
floor
of
dried
grass
or
some
woolly
material
this
she
builds
an
egg
compartment
or
egg
cell
which
is
filled
with
that
famous
mixture
called
beebread
also
builds
one
or
two
waxen
cups
which
she
fills
with
honey
a
group
of
eggs
is
deposited
in
a
cavity
in
the
beebread
loaf
and
the
egg
compartment
is
closed

afterward
keeps
incubating

guarding
her

until

in
the
season
broods
of
workers
that
appear
later
tend
to
be
bigger
than
the
first
ones
probably
because
they
are
better
fed
the
middle
of
the
summer
many
of
the
larvae
apparently
receive
such
a
good
diet
that
it
is
optimal
and
it
is
then
that
young
queens
begin
to
appear
males
or
drones
are
produced
mostly
from
the
unfertilized
eggs
of
workers
although
a
few
may
be
produced
by
the
queen
young
queens
and
drones
leave
the
nest
and
mate
and
after
a
short
period
of
freedom
the
fertilized
young
queens
will
begin
to
dig
in
for
the
winter
is
an
amazing
fact
that
in
some
species
this
will
happen
while
the
summer
is
still
in
full
swing
for
instance
in
temperature
then
is
still
very
high
the
old

the
queen
will
in
the
early
fall
cease
to
lay
the
fertilized
eggs
that
will
produce
females
a
result
the
proportion
of
males
which
leave
the
nest
increases
and
eventually
the
old
colony
will
die
out
completely
nest
itself
the
structure
that
in
some
cases
housed
about
individuals
when
the
season
was
at
its
peak
is
now
rapidly
destroyed
by
the
scavenging
larvae
of
certain
beetles
and
moths
always
though
does
the
development
of
a
bumblebee
colony
take
place
in
the
smooth
fashion
we
have
just
described
members
of
the
bee
family
have
become
idlers
social
parasites
that
live
at
the
expense
of
their
hardworking
relatives
can
thus
suffer
severely
from
the
onslaughts
of
the
as
it
is
called
in
some
countries
individuals
of
look
deceptively
like
the
workers
and
queens
of
the
bumblebees
they
victimize
one
sure
way
to
tell
victim
and
villain
apart
is
to
examine
the
hind
legs
which
in
the
case
of
the
idler
lack
the
pollen
baskets
naturally
female
parasite
spends
much
time
in
her
efforts
to
find
a
nest
of
her
host
she
succeeds
she
usually
manages
to
slip
in
unobtrusively
to
deposit
an
egg
on
a
completed
loaf
of
beebread
before
the
bumblebees
seal
the
egg
compartment
hosts
never
seem
to
recognize
that
something
is
amiss
so
that
the
compartment
afterward
is
sealed
normally
the
larvae
of
the
intruder
can
develop
at
the
expense
of
the
rightful
inhabitants
and
the
store
of
beebread
on
they
and
the
mother
are
fed
by
the
workers
still
in
a
number
of
cases
it
has
been
claimed
that
the
female
kills
the
queen
let
us
return
after
this
gruesome
interlude
to
our
willow
catkins
in
the
spring
there
are
other
wild
bees
that
command
our
attention
is
almost
certain
that
some
of
these
usually
a
trifle
smaller
than
the
honeybees
are
andrenas
or
mining
bees
are
about
different
kinds
of
in
alone
of
my
favorites
is
armata
a
species
very
common
in
where
it
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
lawn
bee
females
like
to
burrow
in
the
short
turf
of
lawns
where
their
little
mounds
of
earth
often
appear
by
the
hundreds
equal
in
size
to
a
honeybee
armata
is
much
more
beautiful
in
color
at
least
in
the
female
of
the
species
a
rich
velvety
rusty
red
males
are
much
duller
having
mated
an
female
digs
a
hole
straight
down
into
the
ground
forming
a
burrow
about
the
size
of
a
lead
pencil
bottom
part
of
a
burrow
has
a
number
of
side
tunnels
or
cells
each
of
which
is
provided
with
an
egg
plus
a
store
of
beebread
development
of
the
larvae
is
very
rapid
so
that
by
the
end
of
spring
they
have
already
pupated
and
become
adults
they
are
still
enclosed
in
their
larval
cells
and
remain
there
throughout
the
summer
fall
and
winter
appearance
next
spring
coincides
in
an
almost
uncanny
way
with
the
flowering
of
their
host
plants
the
valley
in
for
instance
it
has
been
observed
that
there
was
not
one
difference
between
the
emergence
of
the
andrenas
and
the
opening
of
the
willow
catkins
must
be
due
to
a
completely
identical
response
to
the
weather
in
the
plant
and
the
animal
the
male
and
female
andrenas
have
mated
the
cycle
is
repeated
is
gregarious
so
that
we
may
find
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
burrows
together
we
must
still
call
it
a
solitary
bee
life
history
is
much
simpler
than
that
of
the
truly
colonial
bumblebees
and
can
serve
as
an
example
of
the
life
cycle
of
many
other
species
all
social
life
in
the
group
of
the
bees
is
by
no
means
general
although
it
certainly
is
a
striking
feature
the
basis
of
its
life
history
we
like
to
think
that
is
more
primitive
than
the
bumblebees
way
in
which
it
transports
its
pollen
is
not
so
perfect
either
lacks
pollen
baskets
and
possesses
only
a
large
number
of
long
branched
hairs
on
its
legs
on
which
the
pollen
grains
will
collect
will
do
a
reasonably
good
job
so
that
an
animal
with
a
full
pollen
load
looks
like
a
gay
little
piece
of
yellow
down
floating
in
the
wind
related
to
the
andrenas
are
the
nomias
or
alkali
bees
melanderi
can
be
found
in
tremendous
numbers
in
certain
parts
of
the
west
of
the
for
example
in
and
central
the
of
which
is
devoted
entirely
to
insects
mentions
a
site
in
which
was
estimated
to
contain
nesting
females
the
burrows
are
only
an
inch
or
two
apart
and
the
bee
cities
cover
several
acres
life
history
of
the
alkali
bee
is
similar
to
that
of
but
the
first
activity
of
the
adults
does
not
take
place
until
summer
and
the
individuals
hibernate
in
the
prepupal
stage
most
places
there
are
two
generations
a
year
a
second
brood
of
adults
appearing
late
in
the
summer
must
plead
guilty
to
a
special
sympathy
for
nomias
may
just
be
pride
in
my
adopted
of
but
certainly
love
to
visit
their
mound
cities
near
and
in
or
when
the
bees
are
in
their
most
active
period
name
alkali
bee
indicates
that
one
has
to
look
for
them
in
rather
inhospitable
places
although
by
no
means
always
these
are
indeed
alkaline
thing
is
that
these
bees
love
a
soil
that
is
moist
yet
the
water
in
the
ground
should
not
be
stagnant
either
dislike
dense
vegetation
does
one
find
such
conditions
best
chance
of
course
is
offered
by
gently
sloping
terrain
where
the
water
remains
close
to
the
surface
and
where
the
air
is
dry
so
that
a
high
evaporation
leaves
salty
deposits
which
permit
only
sparse
plant
growth
other
probably
nearly
all
snakes
at
maturity
are
already
more
than
half
their
final
length
put
length
at
maturity
at
two
thirds
the
ultimate
length
for
some
rattlesnakes
and
data
on
garter
and
ribbon
snakes
show
that
the
smallest
gravid
females
are
more
than
half
as
long
as
the
biggest
adults
states
that
when
the
snake
reaches
its
maturity
it
has
already
reached
about
its
maximal
length
but
goes
on
to
cite
the
reticulate
python
as
an
exception
with
maximum
length
approximately
three
times
that
at
maturity
is
hard
to
understand
how
he
concluded
that
most
snakes
do
not
grow
appreciably
after
attaining
maturity
he
was
working
with
species
of
so
perhaps
some
tropical
snakes
are
unusual
in
this
respect
individual
giants
recorded
later
did
fail
to
show
a
reasonable
difference
after
maturity
but
it
is
impossible
to
know
whether
this
is
due
to
captive
conditions
records
of
slow
growth
have
been
omitted
is
possible
to
make
a
few
generalizations
about
the
six
giants
themselves
seems
to
be
a
rough
correlation
between
the
initial
and
ultimate
lengths
starting
with
the
smallest
boa
constrictor
and
ending
with
the
largest
anaconda
on
the
former
are
scanty
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
latter
is
sometimes
born
at
a
length
greater
than
that
of
any
of
the
others
thereby
lending
support
to
the
belief
that
the
anaconda
does
indeed
attain
the
greatest
length
four
of
the
six
the
anaconda
and
the
amethystine
python
cannot
be
included
for
lack
of
data
there
is
also
a
correlation
between
size
at
maturity
and
maximum
length
the
boa
constrictor
being
the
smallest
and
the
python
the
next
in
size
at
the
former
stage
us
speculate
a
little
on
the
maximum
size
of
the
anaconda
in
a
certain
part
of
the
range
it
starts
life
foot
longer
than
do
any
of
the
other
relatively
large
giants
and
reaches
maturity
at
let
us
guess
inches
longer
than
the
others
a
quadrupling
of
the
maturity
length
would
result
in
a
maximum
of
nearly
feet
it
comes
to
rate
of
early
growth
the
python
leads
with
a
figure
of
about
feet
inches
per
year
for
the
first
two
years
more
or
less
rock
python
a
close
second
is
followed
in
turn
by
the
reticulate
python
are
few
data
on
the
boa
constrictor
those
for
the
anaconda
are
unconvincing
and
there
is
nothing
at
all
on
the
amethystine
python
seems
likely
that
the
python
comes
out
ahead
because
records
of
its
growth
have
been
made
more
carefully
and
frequently
it
responds
exceptionally
well
to
captivity
and
does
not
reach
proportions
that
make
it
hard
to
keep
cannot
make
sense
out
of
the
figures
for
post
maturity
growth
at
best
the
annual
increase
appears
to
be
a
matter
of
inches
rather
than
feet
better
records
have
been
kept
over
longer
periods
of
time
and
much
more
is
known
about
the
maximum
dimensions
it
will
be
wise
to
refrain
from
drawing
conclusions
is
often
stated
that
the
largest
snakes
require
five
years
to
attain
maturity
but
this
apparently
is
an
overestimation
best
way
to
determine
the
correct
figure
in
captives
is
by
direct
observation
of
pairs
isolated
from
birth
a
method
that
produced
surprising
results
maturing
of
a
male
python
in
less
than
two
years
his
mate
in
less
than
three
data
on
the
boa
constrictor
about
match
this
approach
is
to
estimate
from
the
rate
of
growth
and
the
smallest
size
at
maturity
from
this
approach
amply
confirm
the
direct
observations
about
three
years
are
required
there
being
a
possible
slight
difference
between
males
and
females
in
the
time
required
the
amethystine
python
and
the
anaconda
must
be
excluded
for
lack
or
paucity
of
data
following
information
on
snakes
varying
greatly
in
size
but
all
with
less
than
a
maximum
shows
when
considered
with
the
foregoing
that
there
is
probably
no
correlation
between
the
length
of
a
snake

to
follow
a
more
direct

somewhat
from

is
derived
both
from

interlobular
bronchial

branches
a
dual
derivation
was
strikingly
demonstrated
during
the
injection
process
where
initial
filling
would
be
noted
to
occur
in
several
isolated
pleural
vessels
at
once
of
these
were
obviously
filling
from
interlobular
branches
of
the
bronchial

while
others
were
filling
from
direct
hilar
branches
following
along
the
pleural
surface
completion
of
filling
anastomoses
were
noted
to
be
present
between
these
separately
derived
branches
unusual
increase
in
the
number
of
bronchial
arteries
present
within
the
substance
of
the
lung
was
noted
was
accounted
for
primarily
by
the
presence
of
a
bronchial
artery
closely
following
the
pulmonary
artery
diameter
of
this
bronchial
artery
was
much
too
large
for
it
to
be
a

its

would
be
to
that
of
the
pulmonary

vessel
could
be
followed
to
the

where
it
directly
provided
bronchial
arterial
blood
to
the
alveolar
capillary
bed
three
other
direct
pathways
of
alveolar
bronchial
arterial
supply
were
noted
via
the
pleura
through
the
interlobular
septa
and
along
the
terminal
bronchiole
bronchial
arteriolar
anastomosis
was
noted
at
the

level
is
evident
that
many
marked
and
striking
differences
exist
between
lungs
when
an
comparison
is
made
significance
of
these
differences
has
not
been
studied
nor
has
the
existence
of
corresponding
physiologic
differences
been
determined
the
dynamics
of
airflow
from
morphologic
considerations
alone
may
conceivably
be
different
in
the
monkey
than
in
the
horse
volume
and
perhaps
even
the
characteristics
of
bronchial
arterial
blood
flow
might
be
different
in
the
dog
than
in
the
horse
interlobular
air
drifts
may
be
all
but
nonexistent
in
the
cow
probably
occur
in
the
horse
much
as
in
the
human
being
and
in
contrast
are
present
to
a
relatively
immense
degree
on
a
segmental
basis
in
the
dog
where
lobules
are
absent
and
reason
for
such
wide
variation
in
the
pulmonary
morphology
is
entirely
lacking
at
present
certain
wide
limits
anatomy
dictates
function
and
if
one
is
permitted
to
speculate
potential
pathology
should
be
included
in
this
statement
as
well
example
the
marked
susceptibility
of
the
monkey
to
respiratory
infection
might
be
related
to
its
delicate
long
alveolar
ducts
and
short
large
bronchioles
situated
within
a
parenchyma
entirely
lacking
in
protective
supportive
tissue
barriers
such
as
those
found
in
types
and
might
also
wonder
if
monkeys
are
capable
of
developing
bronchiolitis
as
we
know
it
in
man
or
the
horse
addition
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
chronic
generalized
emphysema
occurring
in
a
cow
considering
its
marked
lobular
development
but
conversely
not
difficult
to
imagine
this
occurring
in
the
horse
or
the
dog
the
horse
lung
appears
to
be
remarkably
like
that
of
man
insofar
as
this
can
be
ascertained
from
comparison
of
our
findings
in
the
horse
with
those
of
others
in
the
human
being
only
area
in
which
one
might
find
major
disagreement
in
this
matter
is
in
regard
to
the
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
early
as
claimed
an
alveolar
distribution
of
the
bronchial
arteries
in
human
beings
this
was
reaffirmed
by
opposition
to
this
point
of
view
has
its
staunchest
support
in
the
work
of
however
has
relied
heavily
on
the
anatomy
in
dogs
and
cats
and
he
has
been
criticized
for
using
pathologic
human
material
in
his
normal
study
noted
in
that
a
difference
in
the
pleural
blood
supply
existed
between
animals
nowhere
in
his
published
works
is
it
found
that
he
did
a
comparative
study
of
the
intrapulmonary
features
of
various
mammalian
lungs
other
than
in
the
dog
and
cat
meaning
of
this
variation
in
distribution
of
the
bronchial
artery
as
found
in
the
horse
is
not
clear
this
artery
is
known
to
be
a
nutrient
vessel
with
a
distribution
primarily
to
the
proximal
airways
and
supportive
tissues
of
the
lung
alveoli
and
respiratory
bronchioles
are
primarily
diffusing
tissues
they
are
capable
of
extracting
their
required
oxygen
either
from
the
surrounding
air
and
or
from
pulmonary
arterial
blood
an
explanation
of
this
alveolar
bronchial
artery
supply
might
be
the
nutritive
requirement
of
an
increased
amount
of
supportive
tissue
not
primarily
diffusing
in
nature
in
the
region
of
the
alveolus
this
be
true
the
possibility
exists
that
an
occlusive
lesion
of
the
bronchial
arteries
might
cause
widespread
degeneration
of
supportive
tissue
similar
to
that
seen
in
generalized
emphysema
would
not
expect
such
an
event
to
occur
in
animals
possessing
lungs
of
types
or
presence
of
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery
anastomoses
was
first
noted
in
by
and
thereafter
by
many
others
and
and
have
all
claimed
their
normal
but
relatively
nonfunctional
existence
in
the
human
being
is
the
principal
antagonist
of
this
viewpoint
criticism
of
the
views
his
conclusions
were
based
upon
dog
lung
injection
studies
in
which
all
of
the
vascular
channels
were
first
filled
with
a
solution
under
pressure
and
then
were
injected
with
various
sized
colored
particles
designed
to
stop
at
the
arteriolar
level
early
as
and
demonstrated
with
perfusion
studies
in
dogs
that
bronchial
artery
flow
would
remain
constant
at
a
certain
low
level
when
pressure
was
maintained
in
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
but
that
increases
in
bronchial
artery
flow
would
occur
in
response
to
a
relative
drop
in
pulmonary
artery
pressure
and
in
and
in
reaffirmed
this
own
studies
in
which
bronchial
artery
anastomoses
were
demonstrated
were
accomplished
by
injecting
the
bronchial
artery
first
with
no
pressure
on
the
pulmonary
artery
or
vein
and
then
by
injecting
the
pulmonary
artery
and
vein
afterwards
is
distinctly
possible
therefore
that
simultaneous
pressures
in
all
three
vessels
would
have
rendered
the
shunts
inoperable
and
hence
uninjectable
viewpoint
is
further
supported
by
demonstration
of
thickened
bronchial
artery
and
arteriolar
muscular
coats
which
are
capable
of
acting
as
valves
other
words
the
anastomoses
between
the
bronchial
artery
and
pulmonary
artery
should
be
considered
as
functional
or
demand
shunts
addition
little
work
has
been
done
on
a
comparative
basis
in
regard
to
the
normal
existence
of
bronchial
artery
anastomoses
found
these
shunts
in
the
human
being
but
was
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
and
also
were
unable
to
find
them
in
rats
was
unable
to
demonstrate
their
existence
either
by
anatomic
or
physiologic
methods
in
dogs
possibility
that
the
absence
or
presence
of
these
shunts
is
is
therefore
inferred
the
mere
fact
of
failing
to
demonstrate
them
in
one
or
another
species
does
not
conclusively
deny
their
existence
in
that
species
is
however
highly
suggestive
and
agrees
well
with
our
own
findings
in
which
we
also
failed
to
demonstrate
normally
occurring
bronchial
artery
shunts
in
certain
species
especially
the
dog
conclusion
these
findings
suggest
the
need
for
a
comparative
physiology
pathology
and
histology
of
mammalian
lungs
addition
a
detailed
interspecies
survey
of
the
incidence
of
generalized
pulmonary
emphysema
in
mammals
would
be
interesting
and
pertinent
for
the
present
great
caution
should
be
exercised
in
the
choice
of
an
experimental
animal
for
pulmonary
studies
if
they
are
to
be
applied
to
man
is
especially
so
if
the
dog
cat
or
monkey
are
to
be
used
in
view
of
their
marked
anatomical
differences
from
man
it
is
suggested
that
in
many
respects
the
horse

may
be
anatomically
more
comparable
to
that

of

the

of

for

equal
number
of

predominantly
since

the
full
complement
of
intermediate

and
the
two
indicators

be

should
be
somewhat
similar
since
assessments
are
dependent
upon
during
infancy
and
upon
during

is
clear
that
there
are
some
differences
in
the
ratings

there
is
substantial
agreement
a

can
be
made
at

age
during

it
seems
to

the
method
of

to
extend
the

roughly
by
referring

attempted
to
simplify
the
extensive
task
of
analyzing

of
each

more
than
values
for
the
entire
group
by
constructing
figures
for

of
the
centers
so
that
the
data
for
all

and
of
the

will
appear
together
for

are
examples
of
our
method
of
analyzing
the
results
for

other

the
original

in

have
been
included
in
the
principles
used

applied
to
the

as

in
a

distal
phalanx
of

was
chosen
as
an
example
for
discussion
here
primarily
because
fusion
the
maturity
indicator
for
in
long
and
short
bones
occurs
in
this
center
for
girls
near
the
menarche
and
for
boys
near
their
comparable
pubescent
stage
thus
becomes
one
of
the
convenient
maturity
indicators
to
include
in
studies
of
growth
dietary
patterns
and
health
during
adolescence
following
summary
based
on
and
is
an
example
of
one
way
of
interpreting
the
figures
constructed
from
onset

of
individual
children
with

to
the

values
in

have
been
arrayed
in

and
that
between

due

for
the
limits
of
precision
in

years
and
the
known
variations
in
rate
of
ossification
of
these
children
as
described
in

preceding
paper

selected
as
indicating

schedule
at

for
this
particular
epiphysis
girls
and
may
be
said
to
have
the
same
schedule
at
and
seems
clear
from
the
shape
of
the
series
of
arrows
in
that
there
was
about
an
equal
number
of
early
and
late
and
for
the
girls
if
fusion
occurs
in
this
phalanx
near
menarche
early
and
late
menarches
might
have
been
forecast
rather
precisely
at
the
time
of
of
ossification
for
the
girls
with
same
schedule
an
example
of
the
interpretation
of
an
arrow
in
the
figure
which
exceeds
four
months
in
shaft
length
in
conjunction
with
its
position
in
the
figure
girl
had
a
delayed

further
delayed
is
of
interest
that
her
menarche
was
somewhat
later
than
the
average
for
the
girls
in
this
group
similar
analysis
of
for
the
boys
would
necessitate
quite
a
different
conclusion
about
the
predictive
value
of
onset
age
in
forecasting
their
attainment
of
the
pubescent
stage
and
had
same
schedule
at
and
thus
early
forecasting
of
the
pubescent
stage
would
appear
possible
for
only
seven
boys

not
have

the

of

inhibited
by

precise

there
is
no
evidence
so
far
that

whether
this

to
the

iodinating
mechanism
and
a
system

has
not
been

it
seems
most
likely
that

first
converted

and
then
to
as
the
active
iodinating
species
the

it
appears
that

of
this

has
been
studied
in
some
detail
with

no

reason
to
think
that

the

it

clear
that
some
mechanism
must
exist
in

finding
that
the

that

study
of

been
shown
that

the

been
suggested
that
the

drugs

typified
by
thiouracil
drugs

no
effect
on
the
iodide

mechanism
but
they
inhibit
organification
mechanism
of
action
of
these
drugs
has
not
been
completely
worked
out
but
certain
of
them
appear
to
act
by
reducing
the
oxidised
form
of
iodine
before
it
can
iodinate
thyroglobulin
the
other
hand
there
are
a
few
antithyroid
drugs
of
this
same
general
type
such
as
resorcinol
possessing
no
reducing
activity
and
possibly
acting
through
formation
of
a
complex
with
molecular
iodine
of
the
antithyroid
drugs
of
either
type
if
given
in
large
enough
doses
for
a
long
period
of
time
will
cause

owing
to
inhibition
of

then
responds
by
an
increased
output
of

the

effect
of
drugs
that
act
on
the
mechanism
can
be
counteracted
by
addition
of
relatively
large
amounts
of
iodine
to
the
diet
antithyroid
drugs
of
the
thiouracil
type
however
are
not
antagonised

such
means

some
evidence
that
naturally
occurring
goitrogens
may
play
a
role
in
the
development
of
goitre
particularly
in

and
it
seems
that
the

this

discussion
of

let
us
return
once
more
to
the
problem
of

its
physiological
and
pathological
significance
processes
take
place
between
neocortex
and

via
ascending

descending
pathways

induced
by

a

area
in
the

present

cause
increased

the
other
hand
the
temporary
reduction
in
hypothalamic
excitability
through
the
injection
of
a
barbiturate
into
the
posterior
hypothalamus
causes
a
lessening
in
frequency
and
amplitude
of
cortical
strychnine
spikes
until
the
hypothalamic
excitability
is
restored
a
positive
feedback
exists
between
the
posterior
hypothalamus
and
the
cerebral
cortex
if
for
any
reason
the
hypothalamic
excitability
falls
below
the
physiological
level
the
lessened
discharges
lead
to
a
diminished
state
of
activity
in
the
cortex
with
consequent
reduction
in
the
discharges
a
vicious
cycle
develops
tendency
can
be
broken
either
by
restoring
hypothalamic
excitability
directly
or
via
pathways
is
believed
that
drug
therapy
and
electroshock
involve
the
former
and
psychotherapy
the
latter
mechanism
we
comment
further
on
these
pathological
conditions
we
should
remember
that
changes
in
the
state
of
the
hypothalamus
within
physiological
limits
distinguish
sleep
from
wakefulness
a
low
intensity
of
discharges
prevails
in
sleep
and
a
high
one
during
wakefulness
resulting
in
synchronous
potentials
in
the
former
and
asynchrony
in
the
latter
condition
the
dominance
in
parasympathetic
action
with
reciprocal
inhibition
of
the
sympathetic
at
the
hypothalamic
level
induces
by
its
peripheral
action
the
autonomic
symptoms
of
sleep
and
by
its
action
on
the
cortex
a
lessening
in
the
reactivity
of
the
sensory
and
motor
apparatus
of
the
somatic
nervous
system
the
dominance
of
the
sympathetic
division
of
the
hypothalamus
the
opposite
changes
occur
electrical
stimulation
of
the
posterior
hypothalamus
produces
the
effects
of
wakefulness
while
stimulation
of
the
anterior
hypothalamus
induces
sleep
it
may
be
said
that
the
reactivity
of
the
whole
organism
is
altered
by
a
change
in
the
autonomic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
effects
can
be
induced
reflexly
via
the
baroreceptor
reflexes
in
man
and
animals
particular
importance
is
the
study
of
the
actions
of
drugs
in
this
respect
no
drugs
act
exclusively
on
the
hypothalamus
or
a
part
of
it
there
is
sufficient
specificity
to
distinguish
drugs
which
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
from
those
which
produce
a
parasympathetic
dominance

analeptic
and
psychoactive

the
latter
the
tranquilizers
differences
exist
in
the
action
of
different
drugs
belonging
to
the
same
group
as
for
instance
between
reserpine
and
chlorpromazine
as
these
differences
are
they
should
not
obscure
the
basic
fact
that
by
shifting
the
hypothalamic
balance
sufficiently
to
the
parasympathetic
side
we
produce
depressions
whereas
a
shift
in
the
opposite
direction
causes
excitatory
effects
and
eventually
maniclike
changes
emotional
states
produced
by
drugs
influence
the
cortical
potentials
in
a
characteristic
manner
synchrony
prevails
in
the
of
the
experimental
animal
after
administration
of
tranquilizers
but
asynchrony
after
application
of
analeptic
and
psychoactive
drugs
shock
therapies
act
likewise
on
the
hypothalamic
balance

and
clinical
observations
have
shown
that
these
procedures
influence
the
hypothalamically
controlled
hypophyseal
secretions
and
increase
sympathetic
discharges
shift
the
hypothalamic
balance
to
the
sympathetic
side
explains
the
beneficial
effect
of
electroshock
therapy
in
certain
depressions
and
a
shift
in
the
reaction
from
to
normal
reactivity
of
the
sympathetic
system
as
shown
by
the
test
investigators
have
found
a
parallelism
between
remissions
and
return
of
the
sympathetic
reactivity
of
the
hypothalamus
to
the
normal
level
as
indicated
by
the
test
and
conversely
between
clinical
impairment
and
increasing
deviation
of
this
test
from
the
norm
the
theory
that
the
determining
influence
of
the
hypothalamic
balance
has
a
profound
influence
on
the
clinical
behavior
of
neuropsychiatric
patients
has
not
yet
been
tested
on
an
adequate
number
of
patients
and
noradrenalin
tests
applied
with
certain
precautions
are
reliable
indicators
of
this
central
autonomic
balance
but
for
the
sake
of
correlating
autonomic
and
clinical
states
and
of
studying
the
effect
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
on
central
autonomic
reactions
additional
tests
seem
to
be
desirable
was
assumed
that
the
shift
in
autonomic
hypothalamic
balance
occurring
spontaneously
in
neuropsychiatric
patients
from
the
application
of
certain
therapeutic
procedures
follows
the
pattern
known
from
the
cycle
change
in
the
balance
to
the
parasympathetic
side
leads
in
the
normal
individual
to
sleep
or
in
special
circumstances
to
cardiovascular
collapse
or
nausea
and
vomiting
both
conditions
the
emotional
and
perceptual
sensitivity
is
diminished
but
no
depression
occurs
such
as
is
seen
clinically
or
may
be
produced
in
normal
persons
by
drugs
fundamental
differences
between
physiological
and
pathological
states
of
parasympathetic
and
also
of
sympathetic
dominance
remain
to
be
elucidated
a
clue
to
these
and
related
problems
lies
in
the
fact
that
changes
in
the
intensity
of
hypothalamic
discharges
which
are
associated
with
changes
in
its
balance
lead
also
to
qualitative
alterations
in
reactivity
state
of
parasympathetic
tuning
of
the
hypothalamus
induced
experimentally
causes
not
only
an
increase
in
the
parsympathetic
reactivity
of
this
structure
to
direct
and
reflexly
induced
stimuli
but
leads
also
to
an
autonomic
reversal
a
stimulus
acting
sympathetically
under
control
conditions
elicits
in
this
state
of
tuning
a
parasympathetic
response
conditioned
reactions
are
fundamentally
altered
when
the
hypothalamic
sympathetic
reactivity
is
augmented
beyond
a
critical
level
and
several
types
of
behavioral
changes
probably
related

foregoing
remarks
imply
that
the

plays
a
crucial
role
at
the
crossroads
between

and

forms
of
emotion
this
is
the
case
one
would
expect
that
not
only
the
various
procedures
just
mentioned
which
alter
the
hypothalamic
balance
would
influence
emotional
state
and
behavior
but
that
emotion
itself
would
act
likewise
pointed
out
that
emotional
excitement
may
lead
to
psychosomatic
disorders
and
neurotic
symptoms
particularly
in
certain
types
of
personality
but
it
is
also
known
that
the

may
cure

neurosis
phenomenon
raises
the
question
whether
the
guidance
of
the
emotions
for
therapeutic
ends
may
not
have
an
even
wider
application
in
the
area
of
the
neuroses
a
strictly
physiological
procedure
one
may
expect
from
such
a
study
additional
information
on
the
nature
of
the
emotional

experiments
and
therapeutic
work
lie
in
this
area
showed
convincingly
that
anxiety
is
a
learned
conditioned
reaction
and
is
the
basis
of
experimental
and
clinical
neuroses
and
assumed
therefore
that
the
neuronal
changes
which
underlie
the
neuroses
are
functional
and
reversible
important
observation
of
served
as
a
guide
post
to
achieve
such
a
reversibility
by

a

he
demonstrated
the
antagonism
between
feeding
and
pain
mild
electrical
shock
served
as
a
conditioned
stimulus
and
was
followed
by
feeding
pain
became
thus
the
symbol
for
food
and
elicited
salivary
secretion
conditioned
reflex
when
the
intensity
of
the

was
increased
gradually
it
failed
to

strong

an
experimental
neurosis
during
which
the
animals
fail
to
eat
in
the
experimental
situation
thought
that
he
could
utilize
the
antagonism
to
inhibit
the
neurotic
symptoms
through
feeding
experiments
showed
that
this
is
indeed
possible
then
applied
this
principle
of
reciprocal
inhibition
to
human
neuroses
took
advantage
of
the
antagonism
between
aggressive
assertiveness
and
anxiety
and
found
a
relatively
rapid
disappearance
of
anxiety
when
the
former
attitude
was
established
the
interpretation
of
these
significant
investigations
it
should
be
remembered
that
reciprocal
relations
exist
in
the
hypothalamus
with
respect
to
autonomic
and
somatic
functions
which
are
closely
associated
with
the
emotions
antagonism
seems
to
be
based
on
this
reciprocal
relation
between
the
and
ergotropic
systems
a
functional
antagonism
exists
between
an
aggressive
attitude
and
a
state
of
anxiety
in
both
emotions
sympathetic
symptoms
are
present
different
patterns
underlie
aggression
and
anxiety
respectively
as
indicated
by
the
rate
of
the
excretion
of
the
catecholamines
the
state
of
the
muscle
tone
and
the
test
psychological
incompatibility
of
these
emotional
states
seems
to
be
reflected
in
or
based
on
this
marked
difference
remarks
our
attempt
to
interpret
the
emotions
in
their
physiological
and
pathological
range
we
emphasized
the
importance
of
the
degree
of
activity
of
the
parasympathetic
and
sympathetic
divisions
of
the
hypothalamic
system
and
their
influence
on
the
inhibitory
and
excitatory
systems
respectively
stressed
the
reciprocal
relation
of
these
systems
with
respect
to
the
downward
discharge
as
well
as
regarding
the
discharge
we
are
still
far
from
a
complete
understanding
of
these
problems
as
a
first
approximation
it
is
suggested
that
alterations
in
the
hypothalamic
balance
with
consequent
changes
in
the
discharges
account
for
major
changes
in
behavior
seen
in
various
moods
and
states
of
emotions
in
man
and
beast
under
physiological
circumstances
in
experimental
and
clinical
neurosis
and
as
the
result
of
psychopharmacological
agents
view
of
the
important
role
which
emotional
disturbances
play
in
the
genesis
of
neurotic
and
psychotic
disorders
and
the
parallelism
observed
between
autonomic
states
and
psychological
behavior
in
several
instances
it
is
further
suggested
that
a
hypothalamic
imbalance
may
play
an
important
role
in
initiating
mental
changes
primary
decomposition
theorem
are
trying
to
study
a
linear
operator
on
the
space
by
decomposing
into
a
direct
sum
of
operators
which
are
in
some
sense
elementary
can
do
this
through
the
characteristic
values
and
vectors
of
in
certain
special
cases
when
the
minimal
polynomial
for
factors
over
the
scalar
field
into
a
product
of
distinct
monic
polynomials
of
degree
can
we
do
with
the
general
we
try
to
study
using
characteristic
values
we
are
confronted
with
two
problems
may
not
have
a
single
characteristic
value
this
is
really
a
deficiency
in
the
scalar
field
namely
that
it
is
not
algebraically
closed
even
if
the
characteristic
polynomial
factors
completely
over
into
a
product
of
polynomials
of
degree
there
may
not
be
enough
characteristic
vectors
for
to
span
the
space
is
clearly
a
deficiency
in
second
situation
is
illustrated
by
the
operator
on
any
field
represented
in
the
standard
basis
by
characteristic
polynomial
for
is
and
this
is
plainly
also
the
minimal
polynomial
for
or
for
is
not
diagonalizable
sees
that
this
happens
because
the
null
space
of
has
dimension
only
the
other
hand
the
null
space
of
and
the
null
space
of
together
span
the
former
being
the
subspace
spanned
by
and
the
latter
the
subspace
spanned
by
and
will
be
more
or
less
our
general
method
for
the
second
problem
remember
this
is
an
assumption
the
minimal
polynomial
for
decomposes
where
are
distinct
elements
of
then
we
shall
show
that
the
space
is
the
direct
sum
of
the
null
spaces
of
diagonalizable
operator
is
the
special
case
of
this
in
which
for
each
i
theorem
which
we
prove
is
more
general
than
what
we
have
described
since
it
works
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
the
minimal
polynomial
whether
or
not
the
primes
which
enter
are
all
of
first
degree
reader
will
find
it
helpful
to
think
of
the
special
case
when
the
primes
are
of
degree
and
even
more
particularly
to
think
of
the
proof
of
a
special
case
of
this
theorem
primary
decomposition
theorem
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
vector
space
over
the

p
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
where
the
are
distinct
irreducible
monic
polynomials
over
and
the
are
positive
integers
be
the
null
space
of
each
is
invariant
under
if
is
the
operator
induced
on
by
then
the
minimal
polynomial
for
is
idea
of
the
proof
is
this
the
decomposition
is
valid
how
can
we
get
hold
of
the
projections
associated
with
the
decomposition
projection
will
be
the
identity
on
and
zero
on
the
other
shall
find
a
polynomial
such
that
is
the
identity
on
and
is
zero
on
the
other
and
so
that
each
i
let
are
distinct
prime
polynomials
the
polynomials
are
relatively
prime
there
are
polynomials
such
that
also
that
if
then
is
divisible
by
the
polynomial
p
because
contains
each
as
a
factor
shall
show
that
the
polynomials
behave
in
the
manner
described
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
proof
and
divides
for
we
have
the
are
projections
which
correspond
to
some
decomposition
of
the
space
wish
to
show
that
the
range
of
is
exactly
the
subspace
is
clear
that
each
vector
in
the
range
of
is
in
for
if
is
in
the
range
of
then
and
so
because
is
divisible
by
the
minimal
polynomial
suppose
that
is
in
the
null
space
of
then
is
divisible
by
and
so
then
it
is
immediate
that
that
is
in
the
range
of
completes
the
proof
of
statement
is
certainly
clear
that
the
subspaces
are
invariant
under
is
the
operator
induced
on
by
then
evidently
because
by
definition
is
on
the
subspace
shows
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
divides
let
be
any
polynomial
such
that
is
divisible
by
the
minimal
polynomial
of
divides
is
easily
seen
that
divides
the
minimal
polynomial
for
is
are
the
projections
associated
with
the
primary
decomposition
of
then
each
is
a
polynomial
in
and
accordingly
if
a
linear
operator
commutes
with
then
commutes
with
each
of
the
each
subspace
is
invariant
under
the
notation
of
the
proof
of
let
us
take
a
look
at
the
special
case
in
which
the
minimal
polynomial
for
is
a
product
of
polynomials
the
case
in
which
each
is
of
the
form
the
range
of
is
the
null
space
of
us
put
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
we
shall
call
the
diagonalizable
part
of
us
look
at
the
operator
so
reader
should
be
familiar
enough
with
projections
by
now
so
that
he
sees
that
and
in
general
that
for
each
i
we
shall
have
because
the
operator
will
then
be
on
the
range
of
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
vector
space
say
that
is
nilpotent
if
there
is
some
positive
integer
such
that
be
a
linear
operator
on
the
vector
space
over
the
field
that
the
minimal
polynomial
for
decomposes
over
into
a
product
of
linear
polynomials
there
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
on
and
a
nilpotent
operator
in
such
that
b
diagonalizable
operator
and
the
nilpotent
operator
are
uniquely
determined
by
and
and
each
of
them
is
a
polynomial
in
have
just
observed
that
we
can
write
where
is
diagonalizable
and
is
nilpotent
and
where
and
not
only
commute
but
are
polynomials
in
suppose
that
we
also
have
where
is
diagonalizable
is
nilpotent
and
shall
prove
that
and
commute
with
one
another
and
we
see
that
and
commute
with
and
commute
with
any
polynomial
in
hence
they
commute
with
and
with
we
have
or
and
all
four
of
these
operators
commute
with
one
another
and
are
both
diagonalizable
and
they
commute
they
are
simultaneously
diagonalizable
and
is
diagonalizable
and
are
both
nilpotent
and
they
commute
the
operator
is
nilpotent
for
using
the
fact
that
and
commute
and
so
when
is
sufficiently
large
every
term
in
this
expression
for
will
be
a
nilpotent
operator
on
an
space
must
have
its
power
if
we
take
above
that
will
be
large
enough
then
follows
that
is
large
enough
but
this
is
not
obvious
from
the
above
expression
is
a
diagonalizable
operator
which
is
also
nilpotent
an
operator
is
obviously
the
zero
operator
for
since
it
is
nilpotent
the
minimal
polynomial
for
this
operator
is
of
the
form
for
some
but
then
since
the
operator
is
diagonalizable
the
minimal
polynomial
cannot
have
a
repeated
root
hence
and
the
minimal
polynomial
is
simply
x
which
says
the
operator
is
we
see
that
and
be
a
vector
space
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
the
field
of
complex
numbers
every
linear
operator
in
can
be
written
as
the
sum
of
a
diagonalizable
operator
and
a
nilpotent
operator
which
commute
operators
and
are
unique
and
each
is
a
polynomial
in
these
results
one
sees
that
the
study
of
linear
operators
on
vector
spaces
over
an
algebraically
closed
field
is
essentially
reduced
to
the
study
of
nilpotent
operators
vector
spaces
over
closed
fields
we
still
need
to
find
some
substitute
for
characteristic
values
and
vectors
is
a
very
interesting
fact
that
these
two
problems
can
be
handled
simultaneously
and
this
is
what
we
shall
do
in
the
next
chapter
concluding
this
section
we
should
like
to
give
an
example
which
illustrates
some
of
the
ideas
of
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
have
chosen
to
give
it
at
the
end
of
the
section
since
it
deals
with
differential
equations
and
thus
is
not
purely
linear
algebra
the
primary
decomposition
theorem
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
vector
space
be
finite
dimensional
nor
is
it
necessary
for
parts
and
that
be
the
minimal
polynomial
for
is
a
linear
operator
on
an
arbitrary
vector
space
and
if
there
is
a
monic
polynomial
such
that
then
parts
and
of
are
valid
for
with
the
proof
which
we
gave
be
a
positive
integer
and
let
be
the
space
of
all
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
on
the
real
line
which
satisfy
the
differential
equation
where
are
some
fixed
constants
denotes
the
space
of
times
continuously
differentiable
functions
then
the
space
of
solutions
of
this
differential
equation
is
a
subspace
of
denotes
the
differentiation
operator
and
is
the
polynomial
then
is
the
null
space
of
the
operator
p
because
simply
says
us
now
regard
as
a
linear
operator
on
the
subspace
we
are
discussing
differentiable
functions
then
and
are
complex
vector
spaces
and
may
be
any
complex
numbers
now
write
where
are
distinct
complex
numbers
is
the
null
space
of
then
says
that
other
words
if
satisfies
the
differential
equation
then
is
uniquely
expressible
in
the
form
where
satisfies
the
differential
equation
the
study
of
the
solutions
to
the
equation
is
reduced
to
the
study
of
the
space
of
solutions
of
a
differential
equation
of
the
form
reduction
has
been
accomplished
by
the
general
methods
of
linear
algebra
by
the
primary

theorem
describe
the

of

to

must
know
something
about
differential
equations
that
is
one
must
know
something
about
other
than
the
fact
that
it
is
a
linear
operator
one
does
not
need
to
know
very
much
is
very
easy
to
establish
by
induction
on
that
if

that

only

such
that

the

of

and
the

these

form
a
basis
for
the

of

of
binomial
experiments
experiments
are
composed
of
repetitions
of

binomial

may
describe
the

that
occurs
from
one
set
of
trials
of
such
a
binomial
experiment
to
another
devote
a
chapter
to
the
binomial
distribution
not
only
because
it
is
a
mathematical
model
for
an
enormous
variety
of
real
life
phenomena
but
also
because
it
has
important
properties
that
recur
in
many
other
probability
models
begin
with
a
few
examples
of
binomial
experiments
example
trained
marksman
shooting
five
rounds
at
a
target
all
under
practically
the
same
conditions
may
hit
the
from
to
times
repeated
sets
of
five
shots
his
numbers
of
vary
can
we
say
of
the
probabilities
of
the
different
possible
numbers
of
in
mice
litters
of
eight
mice
from
similar
parents
the
number
of
mice
with
straight

of
wavy
hair
is
an
integer
from
to
probabilities
should
be
attached
to
these
possible
outcomes
ones
with
three
dice
three
dice
are
tossed
repeatedly
what
is
the
probability
that
the
number
of
aces
is
or
or
or
binomial
problem
generally
suppose
that
an
experiment
consists
of
a
number
of
independent
trials
that
each
trial
results
in
either
a
success
or
a
failure
and
that
the
probability
of
success
remains
constant
from
trial
to
trial
the
examples
above
the
occurrence
of
a
a
mouse
or
an
ace
could
be
called
a
success
general
any
outcome
we
choose
may
be
labeled
success
major
question
in
this
chapter
is
is
the
probability
of
exactly
successes
in
trials
and
we
answered
questions
like
those
in
the
examples
usually
by
counting
points
in
a
sample
space
a
general
formula
of
wide
applicability
solves
all
problems
of
this
kind
deriving
this
formula
we
explain
what
we
mean
by
problems
of
this
kind
are
often
composed
of
several
identical
trials
and
sometimes
experiments
themselves
are
repeated
the
marksmanship
example
a
trial
consists
of
one
round
shot
at
a
target
with
outcome
either
one
success
or
none
failure
an
experiment
might
consist
of
five
rounds
and
several
sets
of
five
rounds
might
be
regarded
as
a
composed
of
several
repetitions
of
the
experiment
three
dice
are
tossed
a
trial
is
one
toss

of

what
amounts
to
the

thing
if
one

three

each

the

form
the

we
shall
not
distinguish

are
illustrative
of
the
use
of
the
words
trial
and
experiment
as
they
are
used
in
this
chapter
but
they
are
quite
flexible
words
and
it
is
well
not
to
restrict
them
too
narrowly
football

that

now
generalize
these
ideas
for
general
binomial
experiments
an
experiment
to
qualify
as
a
binomial
experiment
it
must
have
four
properties
there
must
be
a
fixed
number
of
trials
each
trial
must
result
in
a
success
or
a
failure
a
binomial
trial
all
trials
must
have
identical
probabilities
of
success
the
trials
must
be
independent
of
each
other
we
use
our
earlier
examples
to
describe
and
illustrate
these
four
properties
also
give
for
each
property
an
example
where
the
property
is
absent
language
and
notation
introduced
are
standard
throughout
the
chapter
must
be

of
repeated

we
study
sets
of
five
shots
for
the

we
restrict
attention
to
litters
of
eight
and
for
the
aces
we
toss
three
dice
without
a
fixed
number
of
trials
a
die
until
an
ace
appears
the
number
of
trials
is
a
random
variable
not
a
fixed
number
trials
of
the
trials
is
either
a
success
or
a
failure
and
failure
are
just
convenient
labels
for
the
two
categories
of
outcomes
when
we
talk
about
binomial
trials
in
general
words
are
more
expressive
than
labels
like
and
is
natural
from
the
viewpoint
to
call
a
a
success
but
in
the
mice
example
it
is
arbitrary
which
category
corresponds
to
straight
hair
in
a
mouse
word
binomial
means
of
two
names
or
of
two
terms
and
both
usages
apply
in
our
work
the
first
to
the
names
of
the
two
outcomes
of
a
binomial
trial
and
the
second
to
the
terms
and
that
represent
the
probabilities
of
success
and
failure
when
there
are
many
outcomes
for
a
single
trial
we
group
these
outcomes
into
two
classes
as
in
the
example
of
the
die
where
we
have
arbitrarily
constructed
the
classes
ace
and
without
the
property
classify
mice
as
or
but
a
hairless
mouse
appears
can
escape
from
such
a
difficulty
by
ruling
out
the
animal
as
not
constituting
a
trial
but
such
a
solution
is
not
always
satisfactory
trials
have
identical
probabilities
of
success
die
has
probability
of
producing
an
ace
the
marksman
has
some
probability
p
perhaps
of
making
a
that
we
need
not
know
the
value
of
p

the

speaking
this
means
that
the
probability
for
each
possible
outcome
of
the
experiment
can
be
computed
by
multiplying
together
the
probabilities
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
single
binomial
trials
in
the
example
and
the
independence
assumption
imply
that
the
probability
that
the

dice
fall

in
that
order
is
we
expect

when
the
trials
have
nothing
to

this

is
viewed
as
composed
of
five
binomial
trials
one
for
each

of
the

the
outcomes
of
the

are
obviously
not

the

is
better
viewed
as
consisting
of

a

extreme

of
dependence
couples

experiment
consists
of
the

from

the
votes
of
the
two
persons
in
a

probably
agree
more
often
than
independence
would
imply
because
couples
who
visit
the

together
are
more

to
have
similar

than
are

we
are
interested
in

can
produce
random
variables
other
than
the

example
the

gets

but
we
take
his
score
to
be
the
number
of

before
his

that
is
or
if
he
gets
no
we
do
not
score

the

constancy
of
and
the
independence
are
the
conditions
most
likely
to
give
trouble
in
practice
very
slight
changes
in
do
not
change
the
probabilities
much
and
a
slight
lack
of
independence
may
not
make
an
appreciable
difference

even
when
the
binomial
model
does
not
describe

the

the

may
still
be
used
as

baseline
for
comparative
purposes
that

we
may
discuss
the

in

of
its

from
the

model
summarize
binomial
experiment
consists
of
independent
binomial
trials
all
with
the

probability
of
yielding
a

outcome
of
the

is

random

with
probabilities
or
more
briefly
shall
find
a
formula
for
the
probability
of
exactly
successes
for
given
values
of

each
number
of
successes
is
paired
with
its

the

of

a
probability
function
called
a
binomial
distribution
choice
of

determines
the

uniquely

different
choices
always
produce
different

except
when
then
the
number
of

is
always
set
of
all
binomial
distributions
is
called
the
family
of
binomial
distributions
but
in
general
discussions
this
expression
is
often
shortened
to
the
binomial
distribution
or
even
the
binomial
when
the
context
is
clear
distributions
were
treated
by
about
and
for
this
reason
binomial
trials
are
sometimes
called
trials
variables
binomial
trial
of
a
binomial
experiment
produces
either
or
success
each
binomial
trial
can
be
thought
of
as
producing
a
value
of
a
random
variable
associated
with
that
trial
and
taking
the
values
and
with
probabilities
and
respectively
several
trials
of
a
binomial
experiment
produce
a
new
random
variable
the
total
number
of
successes
which
is
just
the
sum
of
the
random
variables
associated
with

can
be
inscribed
in
every
such

theorem
is
similar
to
the
theorem
of
that
there
exists
a

cube
around

convex
set
in

has
been
generalized
by

and
to
show
that
in
there
are
families
of
such
cubes
for
the
case
of
squares
inscribed
in

curves
we
remove
the
restriction
to
convexity
and
give
certain
other
results
square
inscribed
in
a
curve
means
a
square
with
its
four
corner
points
on
the
curve
though
it
may
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
of
the
spiral
with
the
two
endpoints
connected
by
a
straight
line
possesses
only
one
inscribed

square
has
one
corner
point
on
the
straight
line
segment
and
does
not
lie
entirely
in
the
interior
from
the
point
at
to
the
point
at
we
construct
the
chord
and
upon
the
chord
as
a
side
erect
a
square
in
such
a
way
that
as
approaches
zero
the
square
is
inside
increases
we
consider
the
two
free
corner
points
of
the
square
and
adjacent
to
and
respectively
approaches
the
square
will
be
outside
and
therefore
both
and
must
cross
an
odd
number
of
times
as

from

also
touch
without
crossing
crosses
when
now
have
certain
squares
with
three
corners
on
any
such
square
the
middle
corner
of
these
will
be
called
the
vertex
of
the
square
and
the
corner
not
on
the

will
be
called
the
diagonal
point
of
the
square
point
on
as
a
vertex
may
possess
a
finite
number
of

by
the

construction
each

by
proceeding
along

then
every

can
be
found
from
the

obtained
by
rotating
clockwise
through

just
the

itself
note
that
two
such
curves
and
cannot
coincide
at
more
than
a
finite
number
of
points
otherwise
being
analytic
they
would
coincide
at
all
points
which
is
impossible
since
they
do
not
coincide
near
each
vertex
we
associate
certain
numerical
values
namely
the
set
of
positive
differences
in
the
parameter
between
the
vertex

its
corresponding
forward
corner

the
vertex
at
these

will
be
denoted
by

in

consider

be
applied
to

prove
several
lemmas

the

also
seen
that

by

also
continuous

in
a

turn
now
to
the
set
of

closed
intervals
fact
that
there

follows
from
the
argument
used
in

that
near

therefore
the
difference

remarks

we
can
make
the
following
remarks
about
the

of

any
value
of

which
all

ordinary
points
the
number
of

be
odd
it
is
clear
that
the
total
number
of
ordinary
intersections
of
and
must
be
even
otherwise
starting
in
the
interior
of

not
finally
return
to
the

and
the
center
of

at
is
the
argument
of
the

not
a
value
for
any
value
of
the
number
of

of

equal
to
the
finite
number
of
tangent
points
corresponding
to
the
argument
plus
an
odd
number
number
of
ordinary
values
of
the

at
will
be
called
its
multiplicity
at
graph
of
f
has
at
least
one

suppose
not
every

over
a

in
the

must
both
be
tangent
points
on
the
component
in
the
otherwise
by
the
component

extend
beyond
these
points
we
see
by
that
the
multiplicity
of

only
change
at
a
tangent
point
and
at
such
a
point
can
only
change
by
an
even
integer
the
multiplicity

given
must
be
an
even
number
is
true
of
all
components
which
have
such
a
bounded
support
this
is
a
contradiction
for
we
know
that
the
multiplicity
of

odd
for
every
have
shown
that
the

that

from
the

that

the

most

of

is
interesting
that
a

can
be
established
between
the

so
that
in

final

from
the
following
considerations
no

it
follows
that
their

can
have
no

other

these

the
only
way
in

all

is
to
have
a
generator
of

not
a

a

then
any

on
such
a
generator
will
be
transformed
into

of

two

in

it
follows
that
there
are
lines
of
which
are
tangent
to
any
line
l
of
any
bundle
having
one
of
these
points
of

as

will
be
transformed
into
the

and
the
generator

and
will
be

that
is
the

field
of

and
class
the

is
a
congruence
whose

is
the

namely
and
whose

is
the

of
the

congruence
of
a

field
of

namely
preceding
observations
make
it
clear
that
there
exist
line
involutions
of
all
orders
greater
than
with
no
complex
of
invariant
lines
and
with
a
complex
of
singular
lines
consisting
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
a
twisted
curve
now
shall
show
that
any
involution
with
these
characteristics
is
necessarily
of
the
type
we
have
just
described
do
this
we
must
first
show
that
every
line
which
meets
in
a
point
meets
its
image
at
see
this
consider
a
general
pencil
of
lines
containing
a
general
secant
of
the
image
of
this
pencil
is
a
ruled
surface
of
order
which
is
met
by
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
a
curve
of
order
there
is
a
correspondence
in
which
the
points
cut
from
by
a
general
line
l
of
the
pencil
correspond
to
the
point
of
intersection
of
the
image
of
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
is
rational
this
correspondence
has
coincidences
each
of
which
implies
a
line
of
the
pencil
which
meets
its
image
since
the
pencil
contains
a
secant
of
it
actually
contains
only
singular
lines
avoid
this
contradiction
it
is
necessary
that
be
composite
with
the
secant
of
and
a
curve
of
order
as
components
it
follows
that
the
secants
of
are
all
invariant
if
this
is
the
case
then
an
arbitrary
pencil
of
lines
having
a
point
of
as
vertex
is
transformed
into
a
ruled
surface
of
order
having
generators
concurrent
at
a
ruled
surface
of
order
with
concurrent
generators
is
necessarily
a
cone
it
follows
finally
that
every
line
through
a
point
of
meets
its
image
at
as
asserted
consider
the
transformation
of
the
lines
of
a
bundle
with
vertex
on
which
is
effected
by
the
involution
as
a
whole
the
preceding
remarks
it
is
clear
that
such
a
bundle
is
transformed
into
itself
in
an
involutorial
fashion
in
this
involution
there
is
a
cone
of
invariant
lines
of
order
namely
the
cone
of
secants
of
which
pass
through
it
follows
that
the
involution
within
the
bundle
must
be
a
perspective
involution
of
order
and
the
invariant
locus
must
have
a
multiple
line
of
multiplicity
either
or
first
possibility
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
which
meets
in
points
the
second
requires
that
there
be
a
line
through
which
meets
in
points
each
case
lines
of
the
bundles
are
transformed
by
involutions
within
the
pencils
they
determine
with
the
multiple
secant
the
first
case
the
fixed
elements
within
each
pencil
are
the
multiple
secant
and
the
line
joining
the
vertex
to
the
intersection
of
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
does
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
the
second
the
fixed
elements
are
the
lines
which
join
the
vertex
to
the
two
intersections
of
and
the
plane
of
the
pencil
which
do
not
lie
on
the
multiple
secant
multiple
secants
of
course
are
exceptional
and
in
each
case
are
transformed
into
cones
of
order
similar
to
these
can
be
made
at
each
point
of
must
have
either
a
regulus
of
secants
or
a
regulus
of
secants
if
no
two
of
the
multiple
secants
can
intersect
if
such
were
the
case
either
the
plane
of
the
two
lines
would
meet
in
more
than
points
or
alternatively
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
the
pencil
determined
by
the
two
lines
would
be
too
high
if
no
two
lines
of
the
regulus
of
multiple
secants
of
can
intersect
then
the
regulus
must
be
quadratic
or
in
other
words
must
be
either
a
or
a
curve
on
a
nonsingular
quadric
surface
now
observe
that
the
case
in
which
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
is
impossible
if
the
complex
of
singular
lines
consists
exclusively
of
the
lines
which
meet
any
pencil
in
a
plane
containing
a
secant
of
has
an
image
regulus
which
meets
the
plane
of
the
pencil
in
lines
namely
the
images
of
the
lines
of
the
pencil
which
pass
through
the
intersection
of
and
the
multiple
secant
plus
an
additional
component
to
account
for
the
intersections
of
the
images
of
the
general
lines
of
the
pencil
if
there
is
no
additional
complex
of
singular
lines
the
order
of
the
image
regulus
of
a
pencil
is
precisely
contradicts
the
preceding
observations
and
so
under
the
assumption
of
this
paper
we
must
reject
the
possibility
that
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
surface
with
the
case
in
which
is
a
curve
on
a
quadric
we
first
observe
that
the
second
regulus
of
consists
precisely
of
the
lines
which
join
the
two
free
intersections
of
and
the
planes
through
any
one
of
the
multiple
secants
each
of
these
lines
meets
in
three
points
namely
two
points
on
and
one
point
on
one
of
the
multiple
secants
consider
an
arbitrary
line
l
meeting
in
two
points
and
is
the
multiple
secant
of
which
passes
through
and
is
the
simple
secant
of
which
passes
through
and
if
are
the
points
in
which
meets
and
if
is
the
image
of

the
generator
it
follows
that
the
image
of

help
by
communicating
a
genuine
concern
with
the
problems
these

face
and
a
readiness
to
provide
technical
and
other
appropriate
forms

where

goal
should
be
to
provide
the
greatest
positive

for
these

to
tackle
boldly
the
tasks
which
they
face
the

time
we
should
recognize
that
the
obstacles
to

and
the
lack

which
characterize
these

may
make

prone

some
of

by

we
should

it
clear
that

choose
to
derive
marginal
advantages
from
the
cold
war
or
to
exploit
their
potential
for
disrupting
the

not

also
risk
their

for

a

we
feel
an
obligation
to
assist
other

in
their

this

pertains
only
to

where

find

between

disruptive

should
also
be

that
the

the
basic

and
more

becoming
instead
more
rigid

inflexible
in

policy
toward

should
stress
our
sympathy

an

the

also
at

in

there

a

brought
out

that
prevails
even
in

diverse
audiences
at

it
is
evidenced
in
the
prayers
offered
in
the
frequent
religious
allusions
and
in
the
confirmation
of
points
on
religious
grounds
unifying
effect
of
religion
is
also
brought
out
in
the
fact
that
historically
peoples
have
clung
together
as
more
or
less
cohesive
cultural
units
with
religion
as
the
dominant
bond
even
though
spatially
dispersed

for

to
resist

not

in
their
own
doctrines
and
policies
and
practices
but
also
in

affairs
having
religious
relevance
has
thus
been
a
significant
factor

conservation
of

also
in

some

a
relatively
short
period
of

usually
about

shift
the
focus
back

forth
between
immediate
external
stressful
exigencies
precipitating
stress

the
key
emotionally
relevant

are
often
in

dramatic
preconscious

obviously
nothing

to
articulate
them
precisely
on
the
spot
and
on
the
basis
of
quick
and
accurate

is
necessary
in

combining
carefully
timed

it
may
be
important
to
accompany
family
members
in
their
use
of
these
resources
if
their
behavior
is
to
be
constructive
rather
than
defeating
expensive
in
time
and
involving
a
great
deal
of
adaptation
on
the
part
of
the
worker
in
terms
of
his
willingness
to
leave
the
sanctity
of
his
office
and
enter
actively
into
the
life
techniques
of

were
found
to
be
of
tremendous
value
when
in

of
specific
preventive
objectives
whatever
the
techniques
used
a
twin
goal
is
common
to
all
preventive

to
cushion
or
reduce
the
force
of

at
the

time
to
encourage

support

to
mobilize
and
use
their
ego
capacities
outlined
an
approach
to
the
theory
and
practice
of
preventive
casework
we
now
address
ourselves
to
our
final
question
place
should
brief
preventive
casework
occupy
in
our
total
spectrum
of
services
should
first
recognize
our
tendency
to
develop
a
hierarchy
of
values
locating
brief
treatment
at
the
bottom
and
intensive
service
at
the
top
instead
of
seeing
the
services
as
part
of
a
continuum
each
important
in
its
own
right
problem
is
perhaps
as
old
as
social
casework
itself
three
decades
ago
undertook
a
study
of
interviewing
because
of
her
conviction
that
casework
had
an
important
but
neglected
place
in
our
network
of
social
services
conclusion
has
been
borne
out
in
the
experience
of
many
practitioners
interviewing
is
neither
a
truncated
nor
a
telescoped
experience
but
is
of
the
same
essential
quality
as
the
intensive
case
work
casework
involving
a
limited
number
of
interviews
is
still
to
be
regarded
in
terms
of
the
quality
of
service
rendered
rather
than
of
the
quantity
of
time
expended
we
are
experiencing
an
upsurge
of
interest
in
the
many
formulations
and
preventive
adaptations
of
brief
treatment
in
social
casework
is
evident
from
even
a
small
sampling
of
current
literature
noteworthy
is
finding
that
the
length
of
treatment
per
se
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
of
successful
outcome
to
a
number
of
studies
the
important
predictors
are
the
nature
and
management
of
the
anxiety
as
well
as
the
accessibility
of
the
helping
person
example
the
level
of
improvement
noted
in
a
recent
experiment
with
a
short
course
of
immediate
treatment
for
relationship
problems
compared
favorably
with
the
results
reported
by
typical
child
guidance
clinics
where
the
hours
spent
in
purely
diagnostic
study
may
equal
or
exceed
the
number
of
hours
devoted
to
actual
treatment
interviews
in
the
experimental
project
startling
significance
too
is
the
assertion
that
it
was
possible
to
carry
out
this
program
with
only
a
percent
attrition
rate
as
compared
with
a
rate
of
percent
reported
for
a
comparable
group
of
families
who
were
receiving
help
in
traditionally
operated
child
guidance
services
reports
refer
to
a
level
of
secondary
prevention
in
a
child
guidance
clinic
approached
by
the
customary
route
of
voluntary
referral
by
the
family
or
by
other
professional
people
to
the
approach
which
have
described
are
evident
in
the
prompt
establishment
of
a
helping
relationship
quick
appraisal
of
key
issues
and
the
immediate
mobilization
of
treatment
plans
as
the
essential
dynamics
in
helping
to
further
the
coping
efforts
in
dealing
with
the
interplay
of
inner
and
outer
stresses
there
are
many
different
possibilities
for
the
timing
of
casework
intervention
the
experiments
recently
reported
from
a
variety
of
traditional
settings
all
point
up
the
importance
of
an
immediate
response
to
the
initial
need
for
help
some
programs
treatment
is
concentrated
over
a
short
period
of
time
while
in
others
after
the
initial
contact
is
established
flexible
spacing
of
interviews
has
been
experimentally
used
with
apparent
success
to
take
the
risk
of
early
and
direct
interpretation
with
the
proviso
that
if
the
interpretation
is
too
threatening
the
worker
can
withdraw
is
another
prominent
feature
in
these
efforts
aim
in
mentioning
this
factor
obviously
is
not
to
give
license
to
wild
therapy
but
rather
to
encourage
us
to
use
the
clinical
casework
skills
we
already
possess
and
to
use
them
with
greater
confidence
precision
and
professional
pride
there
is
obviously
great
need
for
continued
experimentation
with
various
types
of
intervention
to
further
efforts
in
developing
an
operational
definition
of
prevention
at
the
secondary
or
perhaps
in
some
instances
primary
level
the
place
of
intervention
has
already
been
documented
by
a
number
of
investigators
in
a
wide
variety
of
settings
for
example
has
emphasized
the
need
for
a
broad
spectrum
of
services
including
very
brief
services
in
connection
with
critical
situations
brief
treatment
should
be
arrived
at
as
a
treatment
of
choice
rather
than
as
a
treatment
of
chance
the
shortage
of
treatment
resources
and
the
chronically
persistent
shortage
of
mental
health
manpower
force
us
to
innovate
additional
refinements
of
preventive
intervention
techniques
to
make
services
more
widely
available
and
on
a
more
effective
basis

negative

act

present
study
relates
to
the
theory
of

is
hypothesized
that
fertility
is
a
function
of
the
social
system
when
the

as
a
whole
is
considered
and
a
function
of
the

when
the
division
of
core
families

marginal
families
is
considered
four
functional
problems
of
a
social
system
are
to
some
extent
solved
by
the
subsystems
within
this

means
of
geographical

high
fertility

inbreeding
can
be
fostered
and
the
pattern
of
isolation
from
the
greater
society
maintained
order
to
attain
the
goal
of
group
solidarity
and
to
relieve
tension
the
high
fertility
rate
provides
more
group
members
for
mate
selection
and
the
clustering
of
members
in
groups
fosters
acceptance
of
group
controls
maintain
their
intermediate
position
in
the
larger
society
it
is
not
only
necessary
that
members
of
this
population
be
visible
but
that
their
numbers
be
great
enough
to
be
recognized
as
a
separate
distinct
grouping
or
system
in
society
mentioned
above
where

are

supporting
a
type
of
control

has
to
do
with
the
of
parts
problem
of
solidarity
and
morale
again
involves
the
concept
of
values
values
placed
by
the
population
upon
maintaining
a
certain
homogeneity
a
certain
separate
racial
identity
and
therefore
a
certain
separate
social
status
are
important
for
the
morale
of
the
system
morale
is
closely
related
to
pattern
maintenance
and
integration
the
higher
the
morale
and
solidarity
the
better
the
system
can
solve
the
problems
of
the

this
respect
it
would
seem
that
the
greater
the
social
distance
between
the
population
and
the
white
and
populations
within
the
same
general
locality
the
greater
the
possibility
for
higher
morale
and
solidarity
within
the
population
is
conceived
that
one
of
the
means
to
attain
this
social
distance
is
that
of
physical
and
social
isolation
turn
higher
fertility
rates
for
this
population
provide
a
means
of
increasing
the
numerical
quantity
of
the

for
the

of
greater

undoubtedly
all
six
processes
are
operative
within

and
its

two
processes
that
are
of
crucial
importance
to
this
study
will
be
singled
out
for
particular
emphasis
discussing
the
process
of
communication
defines
it
as
the
process
by
which
information
decisions
and
directives
are
transmitted
among
actors
and
the
ways
in
which
knowledge
opinions
and

are
formed
or
modified
by
interaction
may
be
facilitated
by
means
of
the
high
visibility
within
the
larger
community
interaction
is
easier
where
segregated
living
and
occupational
segregation
mark
off
a
group
from
the
rest
of
the
community
as
in
the
case
of
this
population
the
factor
of
physical
isolation
is
not
a
static
situation
the
population
is
still
predominantly
rural
there
are
indications
of
a
consistent
and
a
statistically
significant
trend
away
from
the
older
and
relatively
isolated
rural
communities
appears
to
be
an
important
factor
in
the
disintegration
of
this
group
conclusion
is
however
an
more
realistic
analysis
must
take
into
account
the
fact
that
people
in
the
area
are
in
general
less
segregated
locally
than
group
members
in
rural
areas
the
urban
area
in
other
words
they
unlike
some
urban
ethnic
groups
do
not
concentrate
in
ghetto
colonies
pressures
toward
conformity
are
slight
or
and
deviant
behavior
in
mate
selection
incurs
few
if
any
social
sanctions
such
a
setting
social
contacts
and
associations
are
likely
to
be
heterogamous
resulting
in
a
change
of
values
and
almost
necessarily
in
mate
selection
behavior
the
extent
that
urban
life
contributes
to
the
breakdown
of
the
group
patterns
of
residential
isolation
to
that
extent
it
contributes
directly
to
increased
exogamy
control
process
of
social
control
is
operative
insofar
as
sanctions
play
a
part
in
the
behavior
as
well
as
the

of

is
either
eliminated
or
somehow
made

that

to
be

by

an
oral
tradition
among
the
members
of
the
population
in

to
the
origin
and
subsequent
separate
status
of
the
group
in
the
larger
society
and
divided
though
this
tradition
may
be
it
is
an
important
part
of
the
social
and
cultural
heritage
of
the
group
and
acts
as
a
means
of
socialization
particularly
for
members
of
the
rural
community

the
days
of

achieved
for

the

this
evidence
in
mind
the
writer
began
to
plan
how
he
might
more
effectively
educate
the
married
students
in
his
functional
classes
the
end
of
the
work
he
interviewed
every
married
class
member
at
great
length
found
as
he
had
suspected
a
general
consensus
that
perhaps
over
half
of
the
present
functionally
designed
course
was
not
really
functional
for
these
students
all
admitted
that
the
hindsight
was
not
altogether
lost
their
own
words
it
had
aided
them
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
how
they
had
gotten
into
their
marriages
and
perhaps
they
had
obtained
some
insights
on
why
certain
troubles
appeared
from
time
to
time
fact
they
went
so
far
as
to
caution
the
writer
that
if
he
attempted
to
design
a
section
exclusively
for
married
students
there
should
be
at
the
beginning
some
hindsight
study
but
they
all
hastened
to
add
that
certainly
less
time
was
needed
on
it
than
presently
spent
of
them
felt
a
compelling
need
for
more
coverage
on
areas
that
could
be
only
lightly
touched
upon
in
a
general
survey
functional
course
few
were
doubtful
about
the
merits
of
an
exclusive
section
for
married
students
one
of
them
expressed
it
has
done
me
a
world
of
good
to
listen
to
the
naive
questions
and
comments
of
these
people
can
now
better
see
just
what
processes
provoked
certain
actions
from
me
in
the
past
been
in
an
section
would
have
missed
this
and
believe
that
this
single
aspect
has
been
of
great
personal
value
to
me
comment
and
others
similar
to
it
would
seem
to
indicate
a
possible
justification
for
continuing
the
status
quo
the
weight
of
feeling
was
heavily
in
the
opposite
direction
the
writer
decided
to
hold
one
experimental
section
of
the
functional
preparation
for
marriage
course
in
the
spring
semester
of
exclusively
for
persons
already
married
that
is
prerequisite
marriage
did
not
mean
that
married
students
could
not
enroll
in
other
mixed
sections
and
some
of
them
largely
because
of
scheduling
difficulties
did
only
those
already
married
could
enroll
in
this
one
section
addition
two
other
differences
in
the
two
types
of
sections
must
be
noted
regular
sections
do
not
allow
freshmen
this
one
did
action
was
rationalized
on
the
basis
of
a
small
survey
which
indicated
that
a
high
percentage
of
married
freshmen
women
on
our
campus
never
become
sophomores
of
them
appear
to
drop
out
for
one
reason
or
another
permitting
freshman
students
we
might
extend
the
opportunity
for
such
a
course
to
some
individuals
who
otherwise
might
never
get
to
take
it
has
subsequently
been
verified
by
the
experience
were
encouraged
the
regular
sections
they
have
always
been
more
or
less
discouraged
philosophy
has
been
that
if
they
could
find
the
time
to
attend
class
why
not
encourage
them
to
get
the
credit
and
perhaps
provide
an
incentive
to
do
the
work
more
effectively
auditors
do
not
count
on
faculty
load
with
the
same
weight
as
regularly
enrolled
students
in
this
one
section
we
welcomed
auditors
no
particular
reason
other
than
that
the
writer
felt
it
might
just
might
encourage
both
mates
to
be
in
attendance
of
the
men
on
our
campus
have
a
pretty
set
curriculum
especially
in
the
various
engineering
fields
with
few
electives
till
the
senior
year
it
needs
to
be
noted
that
because
auditors
were
permitted
the
section
began
increasing
in
numbers
each
week
until
at
last
it
swelled
to
such
proportions
that
this
free
auditing
policy
had
to
be
retracted
that
we
began
to
get
visitors
to
class
experimental
class
represented
quite
a
variety
of
students
ranged
from
a
freshman
woman
just
married
through
the
various
academic
growth
stages
including
one
student
to
a
young
faculty
member
recently
married
to
a
senior
man
who
also
attended
ranged
from
those
with
no
children
through
students
in
various
stages
of
pregnancy
to
one
male
with
four
children
three
of
whom
were
teenagers
ranged
from
two
women
members
who
had
experienced
premarital
pregnancy
to
one
couple
twelve
years
married
and
seemingly
unable
to
conceive
might
digress
at
this
point
and
speculate
that
if
it
is
wise
to
create
special
sections
for
special
status
then
why
not
a
special
section
for
women
pregnant
before
marriage
and
one
for
men
with
teenage
children
and
so
on
of
these
speculations
may
have
some
merit
others
are
somewhat
ambiguous
few
who
have
experienced
marriage
can
dispute
the
fact
that
the
focus
of
interpersonal
relationships
is
different
in
marriage
than
in
a
situation
writer
began
this
special
class
by
explaining
his
background
thinking
for
creating
such
a
section
in
the
first
place
made
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
this
was
the
opportunity
and
that
the
future
destiny
of
such
groups
depended
on
favorable
results
from
this
one
did
build
a
framework
of
academic
respectability
and
one
which
did
not
encroach
upon
the
sacred
sovereignty
of
any
other
existing
campus
course
is
to
say
that
this
was
not
a
course
in
wise
buying
or
money
spending
methods
nor
a
course
in
how
to
raise
children
already
have
courses
covering
those
problems
and
so
on
within
that
framework
he
allowed
for
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
steering
committee
of
students
was
organized
on
the
first
day
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
alert
and
constantly
evaluate
and
the
direction
and
pace
the
class
was
taking
writer
being
cognizant
through
his
interviews
of
the
reactions
of
previous
married
students
did
insist
on
there
being
included
some
hindsight
material
the
greater
part
of
semester
time
was
actually
centered
around
the
attitudes
we
are
married
now
how
do
we
make
the
best
of
it
do
we
enrich
our
already
fine
marriage
were
used
as
with
all
sections
but
with
one
big
difference
campus
unfortunately
owns
no
films
they
are
all
either
rented
or
borrowed
the
requested
dates
for
their
use
have
to
be
far
in
advance
writer
never
knew
from
week
to
week
just
where
the
section
might
be
example
the
steering
committee
might
announce
that
the
group
felt
a
topic
under
study
should
not
be
dropped
for
an
additional
week
as
there
was
still
too
much
of
it
untouched
the
writer
had
established
this
democratic
procedure
in
the
beginning
he
had
to
go
along
with
their
decision
after
of
course
pointing
out
whether
he
thought
their
decision
was
a
wise
or
an
unwise
one
the
films
seen
as
they
came
in
coordinated
for
the
regular
sections
were
often
out
of
context
the
writer
has
never
experienced
such
spontaneity
of
discussion
after
film
showings
it
did
not
become
known
to
the
writer
for
some
time
a
nucleus
group
had
sprung
up
within
the
class
began
to
meet
in
the
evenings
and
carry
forward
various
discussions
they
felt
not
fully
enough
covered
in
class
a
few
students
this
group
gradually
increased
to
include
over
of
those
officially
enrolled
in
the
class
and
many
outsiders
as
well
although
only
a
few
of
the
students
were
intimately
acquainted
with
each
other
in
the
beginning
most
reported
that
when
the
semester
ended
their
dearest
and
closest
campus
friendships
were
with
members
of
that
class
fact
they
often
revamped
their
social
activities
to
include
class
members
previously
unknown
outside
reading
reports
were
handled
just
as
in
the
other
sections
the
major
difference
being
that
there
was
a
noticeably
deeper
level
in
the
reported
outside
reading
by
the
married
group
students
although
they
might
read
various
articles
in
popular
magazines
more
often
chose
to
report
on
articles
found
in
the
journals
addition
to
the
noticeable
difference
in
outside
articles
there
was
a
considerable
difference
in
the
outside
books
they
read
a
high
percentage
of
the
regular
students
can
be
expected
to
read
other
texts
which
more
or
less
plow
the
same
ground
in
a
little
different
direction
the
married
students
chose
whole
books
on
specific
areas
and
went
into
much
greater
detail
in
their
areas
of
interest
the
writer
had
not
noticed
this
characteristic
in
married
students
scattered
throughout
the
various
sections
previous
to
this
experiment
nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
those
who
were
continuing
in
single
sections
he
can
only
conclude
that
there
must
have
been
something
contagious
within
the
specific
group
which
caused
this
to
occur
the
main
this
course
took
the
following
directional
high
roads
great
deal
of
time
was
spent
on
processes
for
solving
marital
differences
was
not
a
search
for
a
magic
formula
but
rather
an
examination
of
basic
principles
pertaining
especially
to
all
types
of
communication
in
marriage
short
it
was
centered
around
learning
how
to
develop
a
more
sensitive
empathy
until
the
group
was
satisfied
in
this
area
were
they
willing
to
venture
further
to
adjustment
areas
such
as
sex
religion
finance
and
so
on
here
they
proceeded
to
same
areas
in
relation
to
their
own
future
family
life
stages
developing
these
to
the
extent
of
examining
various
crises
which
could
be
expected
to
confront
them
at
some
time
or
other
an
example
of
this
last
facet
there
were
some
lengthy
discussions
centered
around
bereavement
these
were
concerned
with
the
possibility
of
the
death
of
one
parent
and
the
complication
of
living
with
the
survivor
afterward
but
the
possible
death
of
own
spouse
was
not
overlooked
the
course
one
member
has
lost
her
husband
was
not
a
particularly
shocking
or
unexpected
thing
it
was
previously
known
to
her
that
it
might
happen
just
when
was
an
unknown
and
of
course
the
longer
it
did
not
happen
the
stronger
her
wish
and
belief
that
it
might
not
her
bereavement
this
individual
has
reported
to
the
writer
on
numerous
occasions
about
how
helpful
the
class
discussions
were
to
her
in
this
adjustment
crisis
frequently
class
members
brought
questions
from
their
mates
at
home
were
often
carefully
written
out
with
a
great
deal
of
thought
behind
them
added
a
personal
zest
to
class
discussions
and
participation
sexes
reported
that
the
discussions
on
sex
adjustment
within
marriage
were
extremely
enlightening
writer
sensed
a
much
freer
and
more
frank
discussion
especially
of
this
one
area
than
ever
before
felt
certain
for
the
first
time
in
his
teaching
experience
that
the
men
in
the
class
understood
that
orgasm
as
a
criterion
is
not
nearly
so
essential
for
a
satisfying
female
sexual
experience
as
most
males
might
think
was
probably
much
more
meaningful
because
all
the
women
in
the
class
emphasized
it
time
and
again
the
other
hand
the
women
class
members
appeared
to
reach
a
far
greater
understanding
than
have
women
members
in
other
sections
that
it
is
more
natural
for
males
as
a
group
to
view
sex
as
sex
rather
than
always
associating
it
with
love
as
most
women
seem
to
do
the
reproductive
area
it
could
be
readily
observed
that
all
felt
freer
to
discuss
things
than
students
had
previously
in
mixed
marital
status
sections
this
was
related
to
the
fact
that
all
were
in
on
it
to
some
extent
in
other
sections
has
there
been
the
opportunity
for
the
genuine
discussions
about
the
feelings
of
both
spouses
during
various
stages
of
pregnancy
was
a
particularly
marvelous
opportunity
for
study
in
this
area
since
almost
every
stage
of
pregnancy
was
represented
from
a
childless
couple
to
and
including
every
trimester
fact
we
had
one
birth
before
the
end
of
the
course
and
another
student
had
to
take
the
final
examiantion
a
week
early
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
was
also
one
spontaneous
abortion
during
the
semester
it
is
reasonable
to
believe
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
two
groups
in
their
performance
on
this
task
after
a
brief
structuring
experience
was
predicted
that
subjects
would
adhere
to
more
liberal
concretistic
reports
of
what
the
ambiguous
figure
looked
like
as
reflecting
their
hesitancy
about
taking
chances
was
true
mostly
of
those
subjects
who
did
not
perceive
the
ambiguous
figure
as
people
in
action
such
as
rope
with
a
loop
in
it
and
two
pieces
of
rope
were
quite
characteristic
personality
inventories
three
personality
inventories
were
filled
out
by
of
the
subjects
and
of
the
subjects
were
the
same
subjects
who
were
given
the
test
predictions
had
been
made
concerning
factors
and
on
these
inventories
which
appeared
to
be
directly
related
to
control
and
security
aspects
of
personality
functioning
which
were
hypothesized
as
being
of
importance
in
differential
reactivity
differentiated
between
the
two
groups
at
less
than
the
level
prediction
had
been
made
about
the
difference
in
security
or
between
those
subjects
who
shifted
their
reactivity
when
informed
and
those
who
did
not
nonreactors
had
been
separated
into
two
groups
on
this
assumption
with
the
presumably
secure
nonreactors
and
secure
reactors
being
used
as
the
groups
for
comparative
personality
studies
was
predicted
that
those
who
shifted
in
their
reactivity
would
differ
significantly
from
those
who
did
not
on
the
factor
which
the
investigators
refer
to
as
the
factor
of
the
subjects
in
the
and
groups
as
defined
for
purposes
of
the
personality
studies
were
compared
with
those
subjects
who
shifted
in
or
t
test
on
these
two
groups
shifters
nonshifters
gave
a
t
value
of
which
is
significant
on
the
test
at
the
level
individual
differences
differences
in
reactivity
to
controlled
situations
were
found
among
the
subjects
used
in
the
study
subjects
gave
a
positive
reaction
when
completely
naive
concerning
the
phenomenon
were
subjects
who
did
not
give
a
positive
reaction
even
after
they
were
informed
of
the
normalcy
of
such
a
reaction
and
had
been
given
a
demonstration
were
subjects
who
shifted
from
a
negative
to
a
positive
reaction
after
they
were
reassured
as
to
the
normalcy
of
the
reaction
this
latter
group
there
were
also
differences
in
the
amount
and
kind
of
information
necessary
before
a
shift
in
reaction
occurred
subject
changed
when
given
only
the
information
that
some
people

not
adequately
explained
by
such
a
concept
as
suggestibility
if
suggestibility
is
defined
as
the

on
behavior
by

no
way
either
verbally

did

suggestibility
would
have
to
be
invoked
to
explain
the
failure
of
this
additional
information
to
influence
the
reactors
and
yet
attribute
their
naive
reactivity
to
suggestion
the
reaction
of
the

in
such
a
way
as
to
conform
to
his
own
expectations
of
the
outcome
that
the
is
a
reaction
to
the
pressure
exerted
in
the
voluntary
contraction
because
of
his
knowledge
that
to
every
reaction
there
is
an
equal
and
opposite
reaction
also
seems
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
the
following
reasons
the
apparently
genuine
experience
of
surprise
when
their
arms
rose
and
manifestations
of
the
phenomenon
despite
anticipations
of
something
else
happening
of
becoming
dizzy
and
maybe
falling
an
expectation
spontaneously
volunteered
by
one
of
the
subjects
suggestion
also
seems
inadequate
as
an
explanation
for
those
who
shifted
their
reactions
after
they
were
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
different
from
those
which
they
gave
they
were
told
that
there
were
some
normal
people
who
reacted
differently
than
they
had
they
were
also
informed
that
there
were
other
normals
who
reacted
as
they
had
was
no
implication
made
that
their
initial
reaction
absence
of
an
was
less
preferred
than
the
presence
of
levitation
more
tenable
explanation
for
the
change
in
reactions
is
that
the
added
knowledge
and
increased
familiarity
with
the
total
situation
made
it
possible
for
these
subjects
to
be
less
guarded
and
to
relax
since
any
reaction
seemed
acceptable
to
the
examiner
as
normal
naive
state
could
therefore
be
viewed
as
an
inhibiting
one
for
of
the
subjects
in

were
not
free
to
be
themselves
in
this
situation
an
interpersonal
one
where
there
was
an
observer
of
their
reactions
and
they
had
no
guide
for
acceptable
behavior
to
relax
to
be
spontaneous
and
react
immediately
to
whatever
impulse
they
might
have
was
not
sufficiently
reassuring
until
some
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
had
been
given
other
conditions
might
be
even
more
effective
in
bringing
about
a
change
from
immobility
to
mobility
in
reactivity
it
is
our
hypothesis
that
all
such
conditions
would
have
as
a
common
factor
the
capacity
to
induce
an
attitude
in
the
subject
which
enabled
him
to
divorce
himself
temporarily
from
feelings
of
responsibility
for
his

the

kind
of
irresponsible
feeling
as
she

ascribed
her

with

to
the
effect
they

to
have
of

she

compulsively
necessary

above
discussion
does
not
mean
to
imply
that
control

were
completely
in
abeyance
in
the
subjects

rather
that
they
could
be
diminished

not
to
interfere
with
subject
who
had
both

being
tested
in
the

condition
described
her
subjective
experience
as
follows
feel
going
up
and
on
a
stage
and
not
right
for
them
to
do
so
and
then
you
think
maybe
supposed
to
happen
then
described
her
experience
as
one
in
which
she
first
had
difficulty
accepting
for
herself
a
state
of
being
in
which
she
relinquished
control
she
was
able
to
relax
and
yield
to
the
moment
is
our
hypothesis
that
subjects
are
less
hesitant
about
relinquishing
control
than
are
subjects
that
they
can
give
up
their
control
and
allow
themselves
to
be
reactors
rather
than
actors
is
our
belief
that
this
readiness
to
relinquish
some
control
was
evidenced
by
the
subjects
in
some
of
the
other
experimental
situations
to
be
discussed
below
this
readiness
to
relax
controls
evidenced
in
the
situation
appears
to
be
a
more
general
personality
factor
illusion
subjects
seemed
to
be
freer
to
experience
the
unusual
and
seemingly
impossible
in
the
external
world
was
a
significantly
greater
number
in
this
group

reported
a

as
being
in
a
tilted
position
while
a
tennis
ball
resting
on
it
remained
stationary
on
the
incline
occurred
in
spite
of
the
rational
awareness
that
the
ball
should
be
going
downhill
knew
that
their
perceptual
experience
differed
from
objective
reality
since
they
had
seen
the
desk
and
ball
prior
to
putting
on
the
aniseikonic
lenses
they
were
not
so
bound
by
past
experience
and
constriction
as
to
deny
their
immediate
perceptions
and
to
be
dominated
by
their
knowledge
of
what
the
experience
should
be
change
in
perceptions
by
some
of
the
subjects
after
they
had
been
informed
of
the
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
suggests
that
their
constriction
and
guardedness
is
associated
with
their
general
mode
of
responding
to
strange
or
unknown
situations
were
able
to
experience
at
first
in
terms
of
past
conventionality
informed
as
to
the
various
possibilities
of
normal
reactions
they
were
then
able
to
experience
the
uniqueness
of
the
present
might
be
postulated
that
these
subjects
are
unduly
afraid
of
being
wrong
that
they
perceive
new
internal
and
environmental
situations
as
threatening

question
may
be
raised
whether

not
we
are

yield
a
correlation
of
which

not
significantly
different
from
zero
therefore
we
have
measured
two
different
characteristics
theory
compulsive
behavior
is
a
way
of
diminishing
anxiety
and
one
might
expect
a
negative
association
except
for
the
possibility
that
for
many
children
the
defenses
are
not
sufficient
to
quell
the
amount
of
anxiety
they
suffer

of
interaction
between
anxiety
and
compulsivity

be
taken
up
later
measurement
the
primary
grades
reading
permeates
almost
every
aspect
of
school
progress
and
the
early
experiences
of
success

pattern

find
that
the

compulsives
within
the

where
the

used
in
beginning
reading
compares
favorably
with
that
of
the
low
compulsives
their
achievement
scores
were
somewhat
better
on
an
absolute
basis
although
the
difference
was
not
significant
speculate
that
compulsives
in
the
unstructured
schools
are
under
greater
strain
because
of
the
lack
of
systemization
in
their
school
setting
but
that
their
need
to
organize
for
comfort
is
so
intense
that
they
struggle
to
induce
the
phonic
rules
and
achieve
in
spite
of
the
lack
of
direction
from
the
environment
is
interesting
to
note
that
medium
compulsives
in
the
unstructured
schools
made
the
lowest
achievement
scores
although
not
significantly
lower
their
compulsivity
was
not
strong
enough
to
cause
them
to
build
their
own
structure
conjecture
is
then
that
regardless
of
the
manner
in
which
school
lessons
are
taught
the
compulsive
child
accentuates
those
elements
of
each
lesson
that
aid
him
in
systematizing
his
work
helped
by
a
high
degree
of
structure
in
lesson
presentation
then
and
only
then
does
such
a
child
attain
unusual
success
of
interaction
of
anxiety
and
teaching
methods
statistical
analyses
of
achievement
in
relation
to
anxiety
and
teaching
methods
and
the
interactions
of
the
two
are
presented
in
and
is
a
graph
of
the
mean
achievement
scores
of
each
group
predicted
the
highly
anxious
children
in
the
unstructured
schools
score
more
poorly
than
those
in
the
structured
schools
interaction
effect
which
is
significant
at
the
level
can
be
seen
best
in
the
contrast
of
mean
scores
high
anxiety
children
achieve
significantly
less
well
in
the
unstructured
school
than
do
low
anxiety
children
they
appear
to
do
at
least
as
well
as
the
average
in
the
structured
classroom
most
striking
aspect
of
the
interaction
demonstrated
is
the
marked
decrement
in
performance
suffered
by
the
highly
anxious
children
in
unstructured
schools
to
the
theory
proposed
this
is
a
consequence
of
the
severe
condition
of
perceived
threat
that
persists
unabated
for
the
anxious
child
in
an
ambiguous
sort
of
school
environment
fact
that
such
threat
is
potent
in
the
beginning
reading
lessons
is
thought
to
be
a
vital
factor
in
the
continued
pattern
of
failure
or
these
children
exhibit
child
with
high
anxiety
may
first
direct
his
energy
toward
achievement
but
because
his
distress
severely
reduces
the
abilities
of
discrimination
and
memorization
of
complex
symbols
the
child
may
fail
in
his
initial
attempts
to
master
the
problem
confirms
the
threat
and
the
intensity
of
anxiety
is
increased
as
the
required
learning
becomes
more
difficult
so
that
by
the
time
the
child
reaches
the
third
grade
the
decrement
in
performance
is
pronounced
individual
with
high
anxiety
in
the
structured
classroom
may
approach
the
learning
task
with
the
same
increased
energy
and
lowered
powers
of
discrimination
the
symbols
he
is
asked
to
learn
are
simple
shown
earlier
the
highly
anxious
individual
may
be
superior
in
his
memorizing
of
simple
elements
reduces
the
prospect
of
threat
and
his
powers
of
discrimination
are
improved
the
time
the
child
first
attacks
the
actual
problem
of
reading
he
is
completely
familiar
and
at
ease
with
all
of
the
elements
of
words
academic
challenge
in
the
structured
setting
creates
an
optimum
of
stress
so
that
the
child
with
high
anxiety
is
able
to
achieve
because
he
is
aroused
to
an
energetic
state
without
becoming
confused
or
panicked
et
al
present
evidence
that
the
anxious
child
will
suffer
in
the
situation
and
that
his
performance
will
be
impaired
unless
he
receives
supporting
and
accepting
treatment
from
the
teacher
the
present
study
was
not
a
direct
replication
of
their
investigations
the
results
do
not
confirm
their
conclusion
in
the
two
school
systems
studied
here
judged
the
teachers
in
the
structured
schools
to
be
more
impersonal
and
demanding
while
the
atmosphere
in
the
unstructured
schools
was
judged
to
be
more
supporting
and
accepting
the
highly
anxious
child
suffered
a
tremendous
disadvantage
only
in
the
unstructured
school
and
performed
as
well
or
better
than
average
in
the
structured
setting
means
the
evaluation
of
subparts
the
comparative
ratings
of
parts
the
comprehension
of
the
meaning
of
isolated
elements
in
roleplaying
is
usually
done
for
the
purpose
of
understanding
strong
and
weak
points
of
an
individual
or
as
a
process
to
eliminate
weak
parts
and
strengthen
good
parts
purposes
to
this
point
stress
has
been
placed
on
roleplaying
in
terms
of
individuals
can
be
done
for
quite
a
different
purpose
to
evaluate
procedures
regardless
of
individuals
example
a
sales
presentation
can
be
analyzed
and
evaluated
through
roleplaying
us
now
put
some
flesh
on
the
theoretical
bones
we
have
assembled
by
giving
illustrations
of
roleplaying
used
for
evaluation
and
analysis
should
keep
in
mind
that
many
of
the
exciting
possiblities
of
roleplaying
are
largely
unexplored
and
have
not
been
used
in
industry
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
in
military
and
other
areas
president
of
a
small
firm
selling
restaurant
products
had
considerable
difficulty
in
finding
suitable
salesmen
for
his
business
checking
references
training
the
salesmen
having
them
go
with
more
experienced
salesmen
was
expensive
and
the
rate
of
attrition
due
to
resignations
or
unsatisfactory
performance
was
too
high
was
his
experience
that
only
one
good
salesman
was
found
out
of
every
seven
hired
and
only
one
was
hired
out
of
every
seven
interviewed
was
offered
as
a
solution
and
the
procedure
worked
as
follows
all
candidates
were
invited
to
a
hotel
conference
room
where
the
president
explained
the
difficulty
he
had
and
how
unnecessary
it
seemed
to
him
to
hire
people
who
just
did
not
work
out
place
of
asking
salesmen
to
fill
questionnaires
checking
their
references
interviewing
them
asking
them
to
be
tried
out
he
told
them
he
would
prefer
to
test
them
person
was
to
enter
the
testing
room
carrying
a
suitcase
of
samples
salesman
was
to
read
a
sheet
containing
a
description
of
the
product
the
testing
room
he
was
to
make
successively
three
presentations
to
three
different
people
the
testing
room
three
of
the
veteran
salesmen
served
as
antagonists
handled
the
salesman
in
a
friendly
manner
another
in
a
rough
manner
and
the
third
in
a
hesitating
manner
was
told
to
purchase
material
if
he
felt
like
it
antagonists
came
in
one
at
a
time
and
did
not
see
or
hear
the
other
presentations
each
presentation
the
antagonist
wrote
his
judgment
of
the
salesmen
and
so
did
the
observers
consisting
of
the
president
three
of
his
salesmen
and
a
psychologist
salesmen
were
tested
in
the
morning
and
ten
more
in
the
afternoon
procedure
was
repeated
one
day
a
month
for
four
months
batting
average
of
one
success
out
of
seven
increased
to
one
out
of
three
president
of
the
firm
calculating
expenses
alone
felt
his
costs
had
dropped
while
success
in
selection
had
improved
over
one
hundred
per
cent
reason
for
the
value
of
this
procedure
was
simply
that
the
applicants
were
tested
at
work
in
different
situations
by
the
judgment
of
a
number
of
experts
who
could
see
how
the
salesmen
conducted
themselves
with
different
but
typical
restaurant
owners
and
managers
were
in
a
sense
tried
out
in
realistic
situations
the
point
of
view
of
the
applicants
less
time
was
wasted
in
being
evaluated
and
they
got
a
meal
out
of
it
as
well
as
some
insights
into
their
performances
use
of
roleplaying
for
evaluation
illustrates
how
this
procedure
can
be
used
in
real
life
situations
without
special
equipment
or
special
assistants
during
the
daily
course
of
work
position
of
receptionist
was
opened
in
a
large
office
and
an
announcement
was
made
to
the
other
girls
already
working
that
they
could
apply
for
this
job
which
had
higher
prestige
and
slightly
higher
salary
than
typing
and
clerking
positions
applicants
were
generally
familiar
with
the
work
of
the
receptionist
the
end
of
work
one
day
the
personnel
man
took
the
applicants
one
at
a
time
asked
them
to
sit
behind
the
desk
and
he
then
played
the
role
of
a
number
of
people
who
might
come
to
the
receptionist
with
a
number
of
queries
and
for
a
number
of
purposes
girl
was
independently
tested
by
the
personnel
man
and
he
served
not
only
as
the
director
but
as
the
antagonist
and
the
observer
to
his
surprise
he
found
that
one
girl
whom
he
would
never
have
considered
for
the
job
since
she
had
appeared
somewhat
mousy
and
also
had
been
in
the
office
a
relatively
short
time
did
the
most
outstanding
job
of
playing
the
role
of
receptionist
showing
wit
sparkle
and
aplomb
was
hired
and
was
found
to
be
entirely
satisfactory
when
she
played
the
role
eight
hours
a
day
considering
roleplaying
for
analysis
we
enter
a
more
complex
area
since
we
are
now
no
longer
dealing
with
a
simple
decision
but
rather
with
the
examination
and
evaluation
of
many
elements
seen
in
dynamic
functioning
cases
in
evidence
of
the
use
of
roleplaying
for
analysis
may
help
explain
the
procedure
engineer
had
been
made
the

manager
of
a
firm
supplanting
a
retired
employee
who
had
been
considered

more
than
seven
years

by
his

for
his
technical
competence
and
was
regarded
as
a
comer
he
turned
out
to
be
a
complete
failure
in
his
new
position
seemed
to
antagonize
everyone
rates
of
personnel
went
up
production
dropped
and
morale
was
visibly
reduced
the
fact
that
he
was
regarded
as
an
outstanding
engineer
he
seemed
to
be
a
very
poor
administrator
although
no
one
quite
knew
what
was
wrong
with
him
the
insistence
of
his
own
supervisor
the
president
of
the

he
enrolled
in
a

designed
to
develop

played
a
number
of

then
explained
to
him
in

what
he

he
was
merciless
in
criticizing

who

condemning
them
to
too
great
an
extent
did
not
really
listen
to

that

engineer

manager
had
a
particular
view
of
life
and
refused
to

it
may
say
that
his
attitude
was
foolish
since
he
may
have
been
a
success
had
he
learned
some
human
relations
skills
or
we
may
say
that
his
attitude
was
commendable

his
independence

in

of
a
successful
use
of

and
also
of
the
employment
of
a
procedure
for
intensive
analysis
a
course
for
supermarket
operators
a
district
manager
who
had
been
recently
appointed
to
his
position
after
being
outstandingly
successful
as
a
store
manager
found
that
in
supervising
other
managers
he
was
having
a
difficult
time
playing
some
typical
situations
before
a
jury
of
his
peers
he
showed
some
characteristics
rated
as
unsatisfactory
was
told
he
displayed
for
example
a
sense
of
superiority
and
he
answered
am
supposed
to
know
all
the
answers
was
criticized
for
his
curtness
and
abruptness
and
he
answered
am
not
working
to
become
popular
being
criticized
for
his
arbitrary
behavior
he
answered
have
to
make
decisions
my
job
short
as
frequently
happens
in
analyses
the
individual
feels
threatened
and
defends
himself
in
this
case
the
district
manager
was
led
to
see
the
errors
of
his
ways
necessary
step
between
diagnosis
and
training
is
acceptance
of
the
validity
of
the
criticisms
this
was
accomplished
may
be
described
since
this
sometimes
is
a
crucial
problem
director
helped
a
check
list
of
the
district
errors
by
asking
various
observers
to
write
out
sentences
commenting
on
the
mistakes
they
felt
he
made
errors
were
then
collected
and
written
on
a
blackboard
condensing
similar
ideas
errors
were
located
and
then
the
director
asked
each
individual
to
vote
whether
or
not
they
felt
that
this
manager
had
made
the
particular
errors
were
asked
to
vote
true
if
they
thought
they
had
seen
him
make
the
error
false
if
they
thought
he
had
not
and
cannot
say
if
they
were
not
certain
manager
sat
behind
the
group
so
he
could
see
and
count
the
hands
that
went
up
and
the
director
wrote
the
numbers
on

were
made
during
the
voting
results
looked

eight
of
these
eighteen
statements
which
received
at

of
the
votes
were
duplicated
to
form
an
analysis
checklist
for
the
particular
manager
and
when
this
particular
manager
roleplayed
in
other
situations
the
members
checked
any
items
that
appeared
prevent
the
manager
from
deliberately
controlling
himself
only
during
the
sessions
they
were
rather
lengthy
about
twenty
minutes
the
situations
were
imperfectly
described
to
the
manager
so
that
he
would
not
know
what
to
expect
new
antagonists
were
brought
on
the
scene
unexpectedly
and
the
antagonists
were
instructed
to
deliberately
behave
in
such
ways
as
to
upset
the
manager
and
get
him
to
operate
in
a
manner
for
which
he
had
been
previously
criticized
every
session
the
check
marks
were
totaled
up
and
graphed
and
in
this
way
the
progress
was
charted
life
we
learn
to
play
our
roles
and
we
freeze
into
patterns
which
become
so
habitual
that
we
are
not
really
aware
of
what
we
do
can
see
others
more
clearly
than
we
can
see
ourselves
and
others
can
see
us
better
than
we
see

learn
what
we
do
is
the
first
step
for
improvement
accept
the
validity
of
the
judgments
of
others
is
the
second
step
want
to
change
is
the
third
step
practice
new
procedures
under
guided
supervision
and
with
constant
feedback
is
the
fourth
step
use
these
new
ways
in
daily
life
is
the
last
step
used
for
analysis
follows
these
general
steps
leading
to
training
an
evaluative
situation
is
set
up
and
no
concern
is
with
the
details
that
lead
to
an
estimate
we
say
that
roleplaying
is
used
for
evaluation
can
see
a
person
engaged
in
spontaneous
behavior
and
watch
him
operating
in
a
totalistic
fashion
behavior
is
more
veridical
or
true
than
other
testing
behavior
for
some
types
of
evaluation
and
so
can
give
quick
and
accurate
estimates
of
complex
functioning
roleplaying
for
testing
is
not
too
well
understood
at
the
present
time
it
represents
one
of
the
major
uses
of
this
procedure
spontaneity
training
the
objective
of
this
chapter
is
to
clarify
the
distinctions
between
spontaneity
theory
and
other
training
concepts
addition
the
basic
approach
utilized
in
applying
roleplaying
will
be
reviewed
goal
will
be
to
provide
the
reader
with
an
integrated
rationale
to
aid
him
in
applying
roleplaying
techniques
in
this
unique
training
area
reasons
for
extracting
this
particular
roleplaying
application
from
the
previous
discussion
of
training
are
twofold
training
theory
is
unique
and
relatively
new
is
not
easy
for
the

to
discern
when
in
the
communicating
an
introject

appeared
and
is
holding
sway
learns
to
become
alert
to
changes
in
his
vocal
tone
to
his
suddenly
shifting
to
a
quality
not
like
his
usual
one
a
quality
which
sounds
somehow
artificial
or
in
some
instances
content
of
his
words
may
lapse
back
into
monotonous
repetition
as
if
a
phonograph
needle
were
stuck
in
one
groove
only
seldom
is
it
so
simple
as
to
be
a
matter
of
his
obviously
parroting
some
timeworn
axiom
common
to
our
culture
which
he
has
evidently
heard
over
and
over
from
a
parent
until
he
experiences
it
as
part
of
him
hebephrenic
woman
often
became
submerged
in
what
felt
to
me
like
a
somehow
phony
experience
of
during
which
despite
her
wracking
sobs
and
streaming
cheeks
felt
only
a
cold
annoyance
with
her
such
incidents
became
more
sporadic
and
more
sharply
demarcated
from
her
behavior
and
in
one
particular
session
after
several
minutes
of
such
behavior
which
as
usual
went
on
without
any
accompanying
words
from
her
she
asked
eagerly
you
see
first
did
not
know
what
she
meant

she
must
be
seeing
me
as
some
one
who
had
just
come
from
seeing
her
grandmother
in
their
distant
realized
that
she
had
been
deliberately
showing
me
this
time
what
was
like
and
when
replied
in
this
spirit
she
corroborated
my
hunch
another
phase
in
the
therapy
when
a
pathogenic
began
to
emerge
more
and
more
upon
the
investigative
scene
she
muttered
in
a
low
but
intense
voice
to
herself
hate
that
woman
inside
me
could
evoke
no
further
elaboration
from
her
about
this
but
a
few
seconds
later
she
was
standing
directly
across
the
room
from
me
looking
me
in
the
eyes
and
saying
in
a
scathingly
condemnatory
tone
father
despises
you
at
first
misconstrued
this
disconcertingly
intense
communication
and
quickly
cast
through
my
mind
to
account
for
her
being
able
to
speak
with
such
utter
conviction
of
an
opinion
held
by
my
father
now
several
years
deceased
replied
coldly
you
despise
me
why
you
say
so
directly
looked
confused
at
this
and
felt
sure
it
had
been
a
wrong
response
for
me
to
make
then
occurred
to
me
to
ask
that
what
that
woman
told
you
clearly
agreed
that
this
had
been
the
case
realized
now
that
she
had
been
showing
me
in
what
impressed
me
as
being
a
very
accurate
way
something
her
mother
had
once
said
to
her
it
was
as
if
she
was
showing
me
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
hated
that
woman
inside
her
had
been
an
unmanageably
powerful
introject
was
now
despite
its
continuing
charge
of
energy
disconcerting
to
me
sufficiently
within
control
of
her
ego
that
she
could
use
it
to
show
me
what
this
introjected
mother
was
like
this
woman
had
been
so
filled
with
a
chaotic
variety
of
introjects
that
at
times
when
she
was
in
her
room
alone
it
would
sound
to
a
passerby
as
though
there
were
several
different
persons
in
the
room
as
she
would
vocalize
in
various
kinds
of
voice
somewhat
less
fragmented
hebephrenic
patient
of
mine
who
used
to
often
seclude
herself
in
her
room
often
sounded
through
the
closed
door
as
would
find
on
passing
by
between
our
sessions
for
all
the
world
like
two
persons
a
scolding
mother
and
a
defensive
child
hard
for
the
therapist
to
grasp
are
those
instances
in
which
the
patient
is
manifesting
an
introject
traceable
to
something
in
the
therapist
some
aspect
of
the
therapist
of
which
the
latter
is
himself
only
poorly
aware
and
the
recognition
of
which
as
a
part
of
himself
he
finds
distinctly
unwelcome
have
found
time
and
again
that
some
bit
of
particularly
annoying
and
intractable
behavior
on
the
part
of
a
patient
rests
in
the
final
analysis
on
this
basis
and
only
when
can
acknowledge
this
to
myself
as
being
indeed
an
aspect
of
my
personality
does
it
cease
to
be
a
prominently
troublesome
aspect
of
the
behavior
example
one
hebephrenic
man
used
to
annoy
me
month
after
month
by
saying
whenever
got
up
to
leave
and
made
my
fairly
steoreotyped
comment
that
would
be
seeing
him
on
the
following
day
or
whenever
welcome
in
a
notably
condescending
fashion
as
though
it
were
his
due
for
me
to
thank
him
for
the
privilege
of
spending
the
hour
with
him
and
he
were
thus
pointing
up
my
failure
to
utter
a
humbly
grateful
thank
you
to
him
at
the
end
of
each
session
it
became
clear
to
me
partly
with
the
aid
of
another
schizophrenic
patient
who
could
point
out
my
condescension
to
me
somewhat
more
directly
that
this
man
with
his
condescending
welcome
was
very
accurately
personifying
an
element
of
obnoxious
condescension
which
had
been
present
in
my
own
demeanor
over
these
months
on
each
of
these
occasions
when
had
bid
him
with
the
consoling
note
each
time
that
the
healing
would
be
stooping
to
dispense
this
succor
to
the
poor
sufferer
again
on
the
morrow
patient
a
paranoid
woman
for
many
months
infuriated
not
only
me
but
the
and
her
fellow
patients
by
arrogantly
behaving
as
though
she
owned
the
whole
building
as
though
she
were
the
only
person
in
it
whose
needs
were
to
be
met
behavior
on
her
part
subsided
only
after
had
come
to
see
the
uncomfortably
close
similarity
between
on
the
one
hand
her
arranging
the
ventilation
of
the
common
living
room
to
her
own
liking
or
turning
the
television
off
or
on
without
regard
to
the
wishes
of
the
others
and
on
the
other
hand
my
own
coming
stolidly
into
her
room
despite
her
persistent
and
vociferous
objections
bringing
my
big
easy
chair
with
me
usually
shutting
the
windows
of
her
room
which
she
preferred
to
keep
in
a
very
cold
state
and
plunking
myself
down
in
my
chair
in
short
behaving
as
if
owned
her
room
a
variety
of
meanings
and
emotions
are
concentrated
or
reduced
in
their
communicative
expression
to
some
comparatively
verbal
or
nonverbal
statement
finds
for
example
that
a
terse
and
stereotyped
verbal
expression
seeming
at
first
to
be
a
mere
hollow
convention
reveals
itself
over
the
months
of
therapy
as
the
vehicle
for
expressing
the
most
varied
and
intense
feelings
and
the
most
unconventional
of
meanings
than
anything
it
is
the
intuitive
sensing
of
these
latent
meanings
in
the
stereotype
which
helps
these
meanings
to
become
revealed
something
like
a
deck
of
cards
on
sporadic
occasions
over
the
passage
of
the
and
his
months
of
work
together
cannot
assume
of
course
that
all
these
accumulated
meanings
were
inherent
in
the
stereotype
at
the
beginning
of
the
therapy
or
at
any
one
time
later
on
when
the
stereotype
was
uttered
probably
it
is
correct
to
think
of
it
as
a
matter
of
a
stereotyped
mode
of
expression
and
no
or
but
a
few
other
communicational
grooves
as
yet
being
there
available
for
the
use
as
emotions
and
ideas
well
up
in
him
over
the
course
of
months
it
is
true
that
the
therapist
can
sense
when
he
hears
this
stereotype
that
there
are
at
this
moment
many
emotional
determinants
at
work
in
it
a
blurred
babel
of
indistinct
voices
which
have
yet
to
become
clearly
delineated
from
one
another
it
is
not
a
verbal
stereotype
a
are
you
now
an
want
to
go
home
or
whatever
but
a
nonverbal
one
which
reveals
itself
gradually
as
the
condensed
expression
of
more
than
one
latent
meaning
hebephrenic
man
used
to
give
a
repetitious
wave
of
his
hand
a
number
of
times
during
his
hours
with
his
therapist
the
therapist
came
to
feel
on
sufficiently
sure
ground
with
him
to
ask
him
is
that
hello
or
farewell
the
patient
replied
two
in
one
all
the
possible
forms
of
nonverbal
expression
that
which
seems
best
to
give
release
and
communicational
expression
to
complex
and
undifferentiated
feelings
is
laughter
is
no
coincidence
that
the
hebephrenic
patient
the
most
severely
dedifferentiated
of
all
schizophrenic
patients
shows
as
one
of
his
characteristic
symptoms
laughter
laughter
which
now
makes
one
feel
scorned
or
hated
which
now
makes
one
feel
like
weeping
or
which
now
gives
one
a
glimpse
of
the
bleak
and
empty
expanse
of
despair
and
which
more
often
than
all
these
conveys
a
welter
of
feelings
which
could
in
no
way
be
conveyed
by
any
number
of
words
words
which
are
so
unlike
this
welter
in
being
formed
and
discrete
from
one
another
a
much
less
full
extent
the
hebephrenic
belching
or
flatus
has
a
comparable
communicative
function
in
working
with
these
patients
the
therapist
eventually
gets
to
do
some
at
least
private
mulling
over
of
the
possible
meaning
of
a
belch
or
the
passage
of
flatus
not
only
because
he
is
reduced
to
this
for
lack
of
anything
else
to
analyze
but
also
because
he
learns
that
even
these
sounds
constitute
forms
of
communication
in
which
from
time
to
time
quite
different
things
are
being
said
long
before
the
patient
can
become
sufficiently
aware
of
these
as
distinct
feelings
and
concepts
to
say
them
in
words
have
been
intimating
in
the
schizophrenic
and
perhaps
also
in
the
dreams
of
the
neurotic
this
is
a
question
which
have
no
wish
to
take
up
condensation
is
a
phenomenon
in
which
one
finds
not
a
condensed
expression
of
various
feelings
and
ideas
which
are
at
an
unconscious
level
well
sorted
out
but
rather
a
condensed
expression
of
feelings
and
ideas
which
even
in
the
unconscious
have
yet
to
become
well
differentiated
from
one
another
and
in
their
description
of
the
disturbances
of
thinking
found
in
chronic
schizophrenic
patients
say
in
regard
to
condensation
that
the
lack
of
adequate
discrimination
between
the
self
and
the
environment
and
the
objects
contained
therein
in
itself
is
the
prototypical
condensation
my
experience
a
great
many
of
the
more
puzzling
verbal
communications
are
so
for
the
reason
that
concrete
meanings
have
not
become
differentiated
from
figurative
meanings
in
his
subjective
experience
he
may
be
referring
to
some
concrete
thing
or
incident
in
his
immediate
environment
by
some
hyperbolic
reference
to
transcendental
events
on
the
global
scene
for
example
a
paranoid
philosophizing
in
the
session
about
the
intrusive
curiosity
which
has
become
in
her
opinion
a
deplorable
characteristic
of
human
culture
developed
itself
before
the
end
of
the
session
into
a
suspicion
that
was
surreptitiously
peeking
at
her
partially
exposed
breast
as
indeed
was
equally
often
a
statement
may
consist
with
its
mundane
exterior
in
a
form
of
poetry
may
be
full
of
meaning
and
emotion
when
interpreted
as
a
figurative
expression
a
metaphor
a
smile
an
allegory
or
some
other
symbolic
mode
of
speaking
such
hidden
meanings
the
patient
himself
is
more
often
than
not
entirely
unaware

this

the
techniques
developed
at

we

either
at

one
can
think
of
a
dictionary
entry
as
a
word
rather
than
a
form
all
forms
of
a
paradigm
are
grouped
together
within
the

a
considerable
reduction
in
the
amount
of
information
required
is
possible
example
the
inflected
forms
of
a
word
can
be
represented
insofar
as
regular
inflection
allows
by
a
stem
and
a
set
of
endings
to
be
attached
the
set
of
endings
can
be
replaced
by
the
name
of
a

full
forms
can
be
derived
from
such
information
just
prior
to
the
lookup
of
the
form
in
the
list
if
the
equivalents
for
the
forms
of
a

do
not
vary
the
equivalents
need
be
entered
only

that
they

tendency
is
toward
putting

is
a
parallel
to
this
tendency
in
the

the

are
as
follows

this

the

any
other

stress
is
of
course
more
than
extended
duration
and
normally
centers
on
syllables
that
would
have
primary
stress
or
phrase
stress
if
the

longer
units
they
are
parts
of
were
spoken
alone
a
dominant
stress
given
to

would
normally
center

its
first
syllable
rather

its

the
parallel
is
significant
the

the

from
the

in

it
is
possible
to

the

get

right

or

but
much
of
the
time
there
is
simply
reliance
on
his
understanding
in
the
light
of
context
a
word
represents
a
larger
construction
of
which
it
is
the
only
expressed
part
it
normally
has
more
stress
than
it
would
have
in
fully
expressed
construction
when

to

the

the

the

main
declarative

the

and
therefore
has

the
leader

but
here
with
this
is
deprived
of
stress
makes
here
the
complement
in
the

of
all
the
suggestions
that
were
made
his
was
the
silliest
the
possessive
his
represents
his
suggestion
and
is
stressed
go
represents
itself
and
a
complement
being
equivalent
say
to
go
to
in
which
boat
did
go
on
has
strong
stress
when
it
represents
only
itself
and
on
which
is
its
complement
so
that
go
on
is
semantically
equivalent
to
board
on
has
stronger
stress
than
go
does

a
subordinator
pronoun
however
does
not
result
in

light
stress
both
in

in
that

the

that

and
similarly
in

there
is
much
stronger
stress
on
to

because
it

normally
unstressed
have
instructions
to

is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
have
instructions
that
am
to

this
place
dominant
stress
is
ordinarily
on
leave
the
same
sequence
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
have
instructions
which
am
to
leave
dominant
stress
is
ordinarily
on
instructions
is
clear
that
patterns
of
stress
sometimes
show
construction
unambiguously
in
the
spoken
language
where
without
the
help
of
context
it
would
be
ambiguous
in
the
written
examples
follow
come
by
be

the
first
of
these
sentences
if
by
is
the
complement
of
come
and
is
an
adjunct
of
time
equivalent
to
on
there
will
be
strong
stress
on
by
in
the
spoken
language
but
if
a
complement
for
come
is
implied
and
by
is
a
prepositional
unit
used
as
an
adjunct
by
will
be
unstressed
or
lightly
stressed
at
most
the
second
sentence
if
drinking
water
is
a
gerundial
clause
and
without
drinking
water
is
roughly
equivalent
in
meaning
to
unless
drink
water
there
will
be
stronger
stress
on
water
than
on
drinking
but
if
drinking
is
a
gerundial
noun
modifying
water
and
without
drinking
water
is
equivalent
to
without
water
for
drinking
there
will
be
stronger
stress
on
drinking
than
on
water
the
use
of
stress
in
comparison
and
contrast
for
example
can
undermine
distinctions
such
as
these
patterns
of
stress
are
not
always
unambiguous
by
any
means
the
have
busy
lives
without
visiting
relatives
only
context
can
indicate
whether
visiting
relatives
is
equivalent
in
meaning
to
paying
visits
to
relatives
or
to
relatives
who
are
visiting
them
and
in
looked
up
the
number
and
looked
up
the
chimney
only
the
meanings
of
number
and
chimney
make
it
clear
that

is
syntactically
a
second
complement
in
the
first
sentence
and
a
preposition
followed
by
its
object
in
the
second
are
linguistic
units
centering
in
peaks
which
are
usually
vocalic
but
as
has
been
noted
are
consonantal
under
certain
circumstances
and
which
may
or
may
not
be
combined
with
preceding
following
consonants
or
combinations
of
consonants
are
genuine
units
but
division
of
words
and
sentences
into
them
presents
great
difficulties
even
the
number
of
syllables
is
not
clear
on
this
point
is
strongest
before
and
or
the
point
of
view
of
word
formation
real

be
expected

that
is
employed
also
in

ity

added
real
clearly
has
two

there
is
every
reason
to
regard
deal
as
a
monosyllable
and
because
of
the
fact
that
commonly
has
the
quality
of
when
it
follows
vowel
sounds
deal
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
satisfactory
rhyme
with

is
obvious
enough
that
linguists
in
general
have
been
less
successful
in
coping
with
tone
systems
than
with
consonants
or
vowels
single
explanation
is
adequate
to
account
for
this
however
is
urgent
and
at

three
things
will
be

first
is
a

of

in

specific
details
advanced
student
has
read
a
considerable
number
of

some
of

no
more
of
the
range
of
possibilities
in
tone
systems
than
the
distinction
between
register
and
contour
languages
limited
familiarity
with
the
possible
phenomena
has
severely
hampered
work
with
tone
analysis
will
continue
to
be
difficult
and
unsatisfactory
until
a
more
representative
selection
of
systems
is
familar
to
every
practicing
field
linguist
like
these
four
if
widely
read
will
contribute
importantly
to
improvement
of
our
analytic
work
second
need
is
better
field
techniques
great
majority
of
linguists
fall
into
one
or
more
of
a
number
of
overlapping
types
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
cannot
be
analysed
those
who
are
personally
scared
of
tone
and
tone
languages
generally
those
who
are
convinced
that
tone
is
merely
an
unnecessary
marginal
feature
in
those
languages
where
it
occurs
those
who
have
no
idea
how
to
proceed
with
tone
analysis
those
who
take
a
simplistic
view
of
the
whole
matter
result
has
been
neglect
fumbling
efforts
or
superficial
treatment
these
maladies
overlap
so
must
the
cure
such
as
these
four
will
simultaneously
combat
the
assumptions
that
tone
is
impossible
and
that
it
is
simple
will
give
suggestions
that
can
be
worked
up
into
field
procedures
field
techniques
will
not
only
equip
linguists
for
better
work
but
also
help
them
overcome
negative
attitudes
none
of
these
papers
says
much
directly
about
field
techniques
it
is
worth
pondering
that
very
little
has
been
published
on
any
phase
of
field
techniques
in
linguistics
things
have
been
disseminated
by
other
means
but
always
in
the
wake
of
extensive
publication
of
analytic
results
third
need
is
for
better
theory
should
expect
that
general
phonologic
theory
should
be
as
adequate
for
tone
as
for
consonants
and
vowels
but
it
has
not
been
can
only
be
for
one
of
two
reasons
either
the
two
are
quite
different
and
will
require
totally
different
theory
and
hence
techniques
or
our
existing
theories
are
insufficiently
general
as
suspect
the
problem
is
largely
of
the
second
sort
then
development
of
a
theory
better
able
to
handle
tone
will
result
automatically
in
better
theory
for
all
phonologic
subsystems
issue
that
must
be
faced
is
the
relative
difficulty
of
analysis
of
different
phonologic
subsystems
tone
systems
typically
comprise
fewer
units
than
either
consonant
or
vowel
systems
we
might
expect
that
they
would
be
the
easiest
part
of
a
phonologic
analysis
practice
does
not
often
work
out
this
way
systems
are
certainly
more
complex
than
the
number
of
units
would
suggest
and
often
analytically
more
difficult
than
much
larger
consonantal
systems
has
suggested
one
explanation
languages
use
for
linguistic
contrasts
speech
parameters
which
also
function
heavily
in
nonlinguistic
use
may
both
divert
the
attention
of
the
uninitiate
and
cause
confusion
for
the
more
knowledgeable
problem
is
to
disentangle
the
linguistic
features
of
pitch
from
the
nonlinguistic
features
course
something
of
the
same
sort
occurs
with
other
sectors
of
the
phonology
consonantal
articulations
have
both
a
linguistic
and
an
individual
component
in
general
the
individual
variation
is
a
small
thing
added
onto
basic
linguistic
features
of
greater
magnitude
tone
individual
differences
may
be
greater
than
the
linguistic
contrasts
which
are
superimposed
on
them
differences
from
one
speaker
to
another
or
from
one
emotional
state
to
another
may
far
exceed
the
small
differences
between
tones
any
such
suggestion
accounts
for
only
some
of
the
difficulties
in
hearing
tone
or
in
developing
a
realistic
attitude
about
tone
but
not
for
the
analytic
difficulties
that
occur
even
when
tone
is
meticulously
recorded
second
explanation
is
suggested
by
the
material
described
in
paper
and
intonation
often
become
seriously
intermeshed
can
be
adequately
systematized
until
we
are
able
to
separate
the
two
and
assign
the
observed
phenomena
individually
to
one
or
the
other
pairs
of
phonologic
subsystems
also
interact
or
overlap
in
this
way
for
example
duration
sometimes
figures
in
both
the
vowel
system
and
the
intonation
phonetic
features
for
example
glottal
catch
or
murmur
are
sometimes
to
be
assigned
to
segmental
phonemics
and
sometimes
to
accentual
systems
no
other
two
phonologic
systems
are
as
difficult
to
disentangle
as
are
tone
and
intonation
in
some
languages
explanation
of
tone
difficulties
however
does
not
apply
in
all
languages
some
the
type
mentioned
above
interaction
of
tone
and
intonation
is
restricted
to
the
ends
of
intonation
spans
many
of
the
syllables
intonation
can
be
safely
ignored
and
much
of
the
tonal
analysis
can
be
done
without
any
study
of
intonation
even
in
such
languages
tone
analysis
has
not
been
as
simple
as
one
might
expect
third
explanation
is
suggested
by
analysis
of
tone
we
see
a
basically
simple
phonemic
system
enmeshed
in
a
very
complex
and
puzzling
morphophonemic
system
the
phonemes
can
be
very
easily
stated
no
one
is
likely
to
be
satisfied
with
the
statement
until
phonemic
occurrences
can
be
related
in
some
way
to
morphemic
units
until
the
morphophonemics
is
worked
out
or
at
least
far
enough
that
it
seems
reasonable
to
expect
success
the
typical
tone
language
tonal
morphophonemics
is
of
the
same
order
of
complexity
as
consonantal
morphophonemics
phonemic
systems
which
must
support
these
morphophonemic
systems
however
are
very
different
inventory
of
tones
is
much
smaller
and
commonly
the
contrasts
range
along
one
single
dimension
pitch
level
systems
are
not
merely
larger
they
are
multidimensional
rules
may
be
thought
of
as
joining
certain
points
in
the
system
possibilities
in
the
consonantal
system
are
very
numerous
and
only
a
small
portion
of
them
are
actually
used
connected
by
a
morphophonemic
rule
commonly
show
a
good
bit
of
phonetic
similarity
possible
because
of
the
several
dimensions
of
contrast
in
the
system
morphophonemics
in
a
common
case
can
do
nothing
but
either
raise
or
lower
the
tone
possibilities
are
few
and
the
total
number
of
rules
may
be
considerably
greater
therefore
there
are
a
number
of
rules
having
the
same
effect
and
commonly
other
sets
of
rules
as
well
having
the
opposite
effect
morphophonemics
is
much
more
confusing
to
the
beginning
analyst
than
consonantal
morphophonemics
even
when
the
total
number
of
rules
is
no
greater
difficulty
of
analysis
of
any
subsystem
in
the
phonology
is
an
inverse
function
of
the
size
smaller
systems
are
more
troublesome
for
any
given
degree
of
morphophonemic
complexity
hypothesis
will
account
for
a
large
part
of
the
difficulties
of
tonal
analysis
as
well
as
the
fact
that
vowel
systems
are
often
more
puzzling
than
consonantal
systems
statement
of
the
system
is
a
different
matter
systems
can
of
course
be
stated
much
more
succinctly
phonemic
system
can
be
stated
without
reference
to
morphophonemics
but
it
cannot
always
be
found
without
morphophonemics
the
more
complex
the
morphophonemic
system
is
in
relation
to
the
phonemic
base
the
less
easily
a
phonemic
system
will
be
analysed
without
close
attention
to
the
morphophonemics
at
least
the
less
satisfying
will
a
phonemic
statement
be
if
it
cannot
be
related
through
morphophonemic
rules
to
grammatically
meaningful
structures
design
of
orthographies
has
received
much
less
attention
from
linguists
than
the
problem
deserves
has
been
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
many
linguists
to
assume
that
a
phonemic
transcription
will
automatically
be
the
best
possible
orthography
and
that
the
only
real
problem
will
then
be
the
social
one
of
securing
acceptance
seems
naive
others
have
been
content
to
give
only
the
most
general
attention
to
the
broadest
and
most
obvious
features
of
the
phonology
when
designing
orthographies
the
feeling
is
that
anything
more
would
be
involvement
in
technical
abstrusenesses
of
possible
pedantic
interest
but
of
no
visible
significance
in
practical
affairs
result
of
this
attitude
has
been
the
domination
of
many
orthography
conferences
by
such
considerations
as
typographic
esthetics
which
usually
turns
out
to
be
nothing
more
than
certain
prejudices
carried
over
from
languages
of
the
suggested
systems
seem
to
have
only
the
most
tenuous
relationship
to
the
language
structures
that
they
purport
to
represent
have
not
always
been
more
enlightened
than
practical
people
and
sometimes
have
insisted
on
incredibly
trivial
points
while
neglecting
things
of
much
greater
significance
a
result
many
people
have
been
confirmed
in
their
conviction
that
orthography
design
is
not
an
activity
to
which
experts
can
contribute
anything
but
confusion
in
examines
one
set
of
related
orthographic
questions
and
its
phonologic
background
in
detail
objective
is
merely
to
determine
what
distinctions
of
length
and
syllabicity
it
may
be
desirable
to
make
explicit
in
a
orthography
do
so
he
finds
it
necessary
to
examine
the
relevant
parts
of
the
phonology
thoroughly
and
in
detail
the
process
he
develops
some
very
significant
observations
about
problems
of
a
sort
that
are
often
difficult
few
of
his
examples
are
of
very
great
interest
and
the
whole
discussion
of
some
importance
for
theory
orthographic
recommendations
are
no
simplistic
acceptance
of
phonemics
on
the
one
hand
or
of
superficiality
on
the
other
he
weighs
each
phonologic
fact
in
the
light
of
its
orthographic
usefulness
concludes
that
some
changes
can
be
made
in
the
current
orthography
which
will
appreciably
improve
its
usefulness
but
hesitates
to
suggest
precise
graphic
devices
to
effect
these
changes
hope
his
suggestions
are
given
the
consideration
they
deserve
in
circles
however
will
not
exhaust
their
practical
usefulness
as
they
rather
clearly
indicate
what
thorough
phonologic
investigation
can
contribute
to
orthography
design
need
many
more
studies
of
this
sort
if
the
design
of
written
languages
is
to
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
other
paper
deals
with
a
phonologic
problem
by
restates
the
already
widely
known
facts
in
terms
of
prosodies
a
restatement
it
makes
only
a
small
contribution
to
knowledge
of
it
would
seem
more
intended
as
a
tract
advocating
the
prosodic
theory
than
a
paper
directed
to
the
specific
problems
of
phonology
paper
has
a
certain
value
as
a
comparatively
easy
introduction
to
this
approach
particularly
since
it
treats
a
fairly
simple
and
straightforward
phenomenon
where
it
is
possible
to
compare
it
with
a
more
traditional
though
not
structural
statement
does
show
one
feature
of
the
system
that
has
not
been
previously
described
it
does
not
as
it
claims
demonstrate
that
this
could
not
be
treated
by
traditional
methods
seems
to
me
that
it
rather
easily
can
of
the
papers
deal
with
grammatical
problems
the
whole
they
maintain
much
the
same
high
standard
but
they
are
much
more
difficult
to
discuss
in
detail
because
of
their
wider
variety
of
subject
matter
comments
must
be
briefer
than
the
papers
deserve
writes
on
must
be
considered
primarily
an
amendment
and
supplement
to
his
early
exhibits
much
the
same
descriptive
technique
and
is
open
to
much
the
same
criticisms
treatment
seems
unnecessarily
and
complex
largely
because
the
method
is
lax
and
the
analysis
seems
never
to
be
pushed
to
a
satisfactory
or
even
a
consistent
are
more
stems
per
item
in
which
expresses
the
fact
that
the
languages
have
undergone
somewhat
more
change
in
diverging
from
than
the
languages
from
may
be
because
the
divergence
began
earlier
or
again
because
the
languages
spread
over
a
very
much
larger
territory
including
three
wholly
separated
areas
or
both
differentiation
however
is
not
very
much
greater
as
shown
by
the
fact
that
shows
stems
per
meaning
slot
as
against
for
with
a
slightly
greater
number
of
languages
represented
in
our
sample
as
against
deduction
of
from
the
stem
item
rate
becomes
against
in
equivalent
number
of
languages
general
facts
are
mentioned
to
make
clear
that
the
total
situation
in
the
two
families
is
similar
enough
to
warrant
comparison
greatest
difference
in
the
two
sets
of
figures
is
due
to
differences
in
the
two
sets
of
lists
used
differences
in
turn
result
from
the
fact
that
my
vocabularies
were
built
up
of
terms
selected
mainly
to
insure
unambiguity
of
meaning
between
illiterate
informants
and
myself
within
a
compact
and
uniform
territorial
area
but
that
vocabulary
is
based
on
second
glottochronological
list
which
aims
at
eliminating
all
items
which
might
be
culturally
or
geographically
determined
in
short
was
trying
to
develop
a
basic
list
that
was
universal
one
that
was
specifically
adapted
to
the
result
is
that
included
animal
names
but
only
and
somewhat
similarly
for
plants
as
against
and
therefore
felt
compelled
to
omit
all
terms
denoting
species
or
even
genera
ox
vulture
salmon
yellow
pine
manzanita
their
classes
of
animal
and
plant
terms
are
restricted
to
generalizations
or
recurrent
parts
fish
bird
tree
grass
horn
tail
bark
root
groups
are
therefore
really
in
content
as
well
as
in
size
classes
are
included
only
by
myself
interrogatives
adverbs
or
only
by
and
pronouns
demonstratives
we
have
left
as
reasonably
comparable
are
four
classes
body
parts
and
products
which
with
a
proportionally
nearly
even
representation
terms
out
of
out
of
come
out
with
nearly
even
ratios
and
terms
against
ratios
versus
adjectives
terms
ratios
versus
verbs
terms
ratios
versus
will
be
seen
that
where
the
scope
is
similar
the
ratios
come
out
somewhat
higher
as
indeed
they
ought
to
with
a
total
ratio
of
as
against
or
except
for
verbs
where
alone
the
ratio
is
lower
exception
may
be
connected
with
use
of
a
much
higher
percentage
of
verbs
of
his
total
list
as
against
in
mine
the
exception
may
be
due
to
a
particular
durability
peculiar
to
the
verb
word
class
ratios
determined
in
more
languages
will
no
doubt
ultimately
answer
the
question
word
classes
differ
in
their
resistance
or
liability
to
stem
replacement
within
meaning
slot
it
is
conceivable
that
individual
meanings
also
differ
with
fair
consistence
and
my
share
identical
meanings
with
allowance
for
several
like
tabulated
these
items
in
five
columns
according
as
they
were
expressed
by
and
more
than
stems
totals
for
these
five
categories
are
not
too
uneven
namely
respectively
with
a
greater
range
of
stems
the
first
two
of
five
corresponding
columns
were
identical
and
stems
the
three
others
had
to
be
spread
somewhat
and
are
headed
respectively
and
stems
the
particular
limits
of
these
groupings
may
seem
artificially
arbitrary
they
do
fairly
express
a
corresponding
grouping
of
more
variable
material
and
they
eventuate
also
in
five
classes
along
a
similar
scale
containing
approximately
equal
numbers
of
cases
namely
in
now
we
count
the
frequency
of
the
items
in
the
two
language
families
appearing
in
the
same
column
or
grade
or
one
column
or
grade
apart
or
two
or
three
or
four
we
find
these
differences
distribution
can
be
summarized
by
averaging
the
distance
in
grades
apart
which
divided
by
gives
a
mean
of
grades
apart
the
distribution
of
the
items
were
wholly
concordant
in
the
two
families
the
distance
would
of
course
be
it
were
wholly
random
and
unrelated
it
would
be
assuming
the
five
classes
were
equal
in
n
which
approximately
they
are
actual
mean
of
being
about
halfway
between
of
complete
correlation
and
of
no
correlation
it
is
evident
that
there
is
a
pretty
fair
degree
of
similarity
in
the
behavior
even
of
particular
individual
items
of
meaning

regards
stem
displacement

basic
glottochronological
list
in
findings
are
first
that
the
individual
items
vary
greatly
and
unpredictably
in
their
persistence
but
second
that
the
semantic
groups
are
surprisingly
unvarying
in
their
average
persistence
as
between
and

conclusion
on
behavior
of
individual
items
is
negative
whereas
mine
on
and
was
partially
positive
second
conclusion
on
semantic

classes
agrees
with
mine
second
conclusion
independently
arrived
at
by
independent
study
of
material
from
two
pairs
of
language
families
as
different
and
remote
from
one
another
as
these
four
are
cannot
be
ignored
also
presents
a
simple
equation
for
deriving
an
index
of
persistence
which
weights
not
only
the
number
of
stems
roots
per
meaning
but
their
relative
frequency
his
persistence
values
for
some
stem
frequencies
per
meaning
are
stem
identical
in
languages
stem
frequencies
and
stem
frequencies
and
stem
frequencies
and
formula
will
have
to
be
weighed
may
be
altered
or
improved
and
it
should
be
tested
on
additional
bodies
of
material
consideration
of
the
frequency
of
stems
per
constant
meaning
seems
to
be
established
as
having
significance
in
comparative
situations
with
diachronic
and
classificatory
relevance
and
presumably
is
on
the
way
with
a
further
contribution
in
this
area
to
relative
frequencies
of
competing
roots
with
his
weighting
seems
to
be
the
first
to
have
considered
the
significance
this
might
have
problem
needs
further
exploration
was
at
least
conscious
of
the
distinction
in
my
full
presentation
that
awaits
publication
in
which
in
listing
set
off
by
asterisks
those
forms
in
which
of

was

the
unasterisked

cases
where
the
combined
of

was
findings
and
others
which
will
in
time
be
developed
will
affect
the
method
of
glottochronological
inquiry
adjectival
meanings
show
relatively
low
retentiveness
of
stems
as
am
confident
will
prove
to
be
the
case
in
most
languages
of
the
world
why
should
our
basic
lists
include
per
cent
of
these
unstable
forms
but
only
per
cent
of
animals
and
plants
which
replace
much
more
slowly
substituted
for
his
adjectival
slots
good
animal
and
plant
items
his
rate
of
stem
replacement
would
have
been
lower
and
the
age
of
language
separation
smaller
irrespective
of
the
outcome
in
centuries
elapsed
since
splitting
calculations
obviously
carry
more
concordant
and
comparable
meaning
if
they
deal
with
the
most
stable
units
than
with
variously
unstable
ones
is
evident
that
has
not
only
had
much
experience
with
basic
vocabulary
in
many
languages
but
has
acquired
great
tact
and
feeling
for
the
expectable
behavior
of
lexical
items
then
this
urge
to
include
unstable
items
in
his
basic
list
is
the
urge
to
obtain
a
list
as
free
of
geographical
and
cultural
conditioning
as
possible
why
that
insistence
is
the
hope
of
attaining
a
list
of
items
of
universal
occurrence
it
is
becoming
increasingly
evident
that
such
a
hope
is
a
snare
that
such
a
list
cannot
be
constructed
but
the
nearer
it
comes
to
attaining
universality
the
less
significant
will
it
be
linguistically
terms
will
tend
to
be
labile
or
vague
and
they
will
fit
actual
languages
more
and
more
badly
practical
operational
problem
of
lexicostatistics
is
the
establishment
of
a
basic
list
of
items
of
meaning
against
which
the
particular
forms
or
terms
of
languages
can
be
matched
as
the
medium
of
comparison
most
important
quality
of
the
meanings
is
that
they
should
be
as
definable
as
possible
proportion
as
meanings
are
concrete
we
can
better
rely
on
their
being
insulated
and
distinctive
elephant
or
a
fox
or
a
swan
or
a
cocopalm
or
a
banana
possess
in
unusually
high
degree
this
quality
of
obvious
indubitable
identity
as
do
an
eye
or
tooth
or
nail
isolate
out
easily
naturally
and
unambiguously
from
the
continuum
of
nature
and
existence
and
they
should
be
given
priority
in
the
basic
list
as
long
as
they
continue
to
show
these
qualities
the
universal
list
as
his
weapon
has
extended
his
march
of
conquest
farther
and
farther
into
the
past
eight
ten
twelve
millennia
back
he
has
proclaimed
greater
or
less
affiliation
between
all
hemisphere
languages
of
this
may
prove
to
be
true
or
even
considerable
of
it
whether
by
genetic
ramification
or
by
diffusion
and
coalescence
the
farther
out
he
moves
the
thinner
will
be
his
hold
on
conclusive
evidence
and
the
larger
the
speculative
component
in
his
inferences
has
traversed
provinces
and
kingdoms
but
he
has
not
consolidated
them
behind
him
nor
does
he
control
them
has
announced
results
on
and
almost
all
other
families
and
phyla
and
has
diagrammed
their
degree
of
interrelation
but
he
has
not
worked
out
by
lexicostatistics
one
comprehensively
complete
classification
of
even
a
single
family
other
than
is
his
privilege
remote
cloudy
possible

values
of
its
own
values
of
scope

potential
and
imagination
there
is
also
a
firm
aspect
to
lexicostatistics
the
aspect
of
learning
the
internal
organization
of
obvious
natural
genetic
groups
of
languages
as
well
as
their
more
remote
and
elusive
external
links
of
classification
first
with
elapsed
age
merely
a
of
acquiring
evidential
knowledge
of
what
happened
in
in
in
in
the
last
few
thousand
years
as
well
as
forecasting
what
more
anciently
may
have
happened
between
them
involves
progress
and
such
will
have
to
be
the
work
of
lexicostatistics
as
a
growing
body
of
scientific
inquiry
of
the
founders
of
glottochronology
has
escaped
our
steady
plodding
and
has
repudiated
his
own
share
in
the
founding
that
is
no
reason
why
we
should
swerve
is
no
apparent
reason
why
we
should
feel
bound
by
rules
and
procedure
since
his
predilections
and
aims
have
grown
so
vast
seems
time
to
consider
a
revision
of
operational
procedures
for
lexicostatistic
studies
on
a
more
humble
solid
and
limited
basis
would
propose
first
an
abandonment
of
attempts
at
a
universal
lexical
list
as
intrinsically
unachievable
and
operationally
inadequate
in
proportion
as
it
is
achieved
would
propose
next
as
the
prime
requirement
for
constitution
of
new
basic
lists
items
whose
forms
show
as
high
an
empirical
retention
rate
as
possible
would
be
no
conceivable
sense
in
going
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
selecting
items
whose
forms
are
the
most
unstable
attempted
middle
course
might
lead
to
devices
like
a
alphabetized
dictionary
from
which
every
fiftieth
word
was
selected
it
was
inevitable
that
differences
of
opinion
should
arise
about
the
methods
for
applying
these
policies
was
nevertheless
almost
incredible
that
four
years
after
there
should
be
a
complete
split
over
with
hot
heads
on
both
sides

to
use

much
of
it
was
still
ruled
by
feudalistic

it
was
taken
for

that
at

the
forms
of
democracy
would
be
established
in

an
agreement

reorganized
on
a
broader
democratic
basis
with
the
inclusion
of
democratic
leaders

to
hold
free
and
unfettered

as
soon
as

a

of

this
completely
clear
with

in

this
corridor
by
her

also
as
inevitable
as
anything

rule

to
the
remainder

generally
collaborated
with

of

in

that
most
of

that

they

short
of
our
dreams

war
conferences
is
the
best
short
explanation
of
the
origins
of
the
that
has
been
written
to
heed
the
lesson
so
clearly
contained
in
the
satellite
treaties
the
on
in
the
exactly
one
week
after
the

a
year
after

the
interminable

chief
results

fanfare

analysis
of
the
election
falls
naturally
in
four
parts
is
the
long
and
still
somewhat
obscure
process
of
preparation
planning
and
discussion
began
slightly
more
than
a
year
after
independence
with
the
first
steps
to
organize
rural
communes
political
interests
supported
electoral
planning
although
there
are
some
signs
that
the
inherent
uncertainties
of
a
popular
judgment
led
to
some
procrastination
second
major
aspect
of
the
election
is
the
actual
procedure
of
registration
nomination
and
voting
technical
skill
was
used
and
the
administration
of
the
elections
was
generally
above
reproach
the
regionally
differentiated
results
which
appear
below
in
tables
are
interesting
evidence
of
the
problems
of
developing
under
even
the
most
favorable
circumstances
third
aspect
and
probably
the
one
open
to
most
controversy
is
the
results
of
the
election
electoral
procedure
prevented
the
ready
identification
of
party
affiliation
but
all
vitally
interested
parties
including
the
government
itself
were
busily
engaged
in
determining
the
party
identifications
of
all
successful
candidates
the
month
following
the
elections
fourth
and
concluding
point
will
be
to
estimate
the
significance
of
the
elections
and
how
they
figure
in
the
current
pattern
of
internal
politics
have
figured
prominently
in
nearly
every
government
program
and
official
address
since
independence
were
stressed
in
the
speeches
of
when
the
first
of
was
formed
and
again
when
the
took
a

the

fundamental

in

the
of

an

the
the
rumors
of

once

for

later
for
the
summer

no

made
more
difficult

revealed
when
the
third

formed
without
support
from
progressive
elements

party
parties
were
on
the
whole
unprepared

while
the
people
were
still
experiencing
and
suffering

of
poor
harvests

internal
and
international
crises
that
harassed
the

a
central
issue

prominently
in
the
government
of
which
the

reportedly
determined
to
keep

until

the
eagerly
sought
homogeneity
of

never
achieved
as
the
quarreled
over
foreign
policy
labor
politics
and
economic
development

even
greater
importance
were

a
means

and
to
conduct
the

this
time
there
is
little
doubt
but
what
election
plans
were
complete
remained
only
the
delicate
task
of
maneuvering
the
laws
through
the
labyrinth
of
politics
and
making
a
small
number
of
policy
decisions
the
rather
tortuous
history
of
electoral
planning
in
an
important
point
emerges
concerning
the
first
elections
in
a
developing
country
and
evaluating
their
results
the
new
country
the
electoral
process
is
considered
as
a
means
of
resolving
fundamental
and
sometimes
bitter
differences
among
leaders
and
also
as
a
source
of
policy
guidance
the
absence
of
a
reservoir
of
political
consensus
each
organized
political
group
hopes
that
the
elections
will
give
them
new
prominence
but
in
a
system
where
there
is
as
yet
no
place
for
the
less
prominent
the
respected
and
effective
institutions
that
consensus
helps
provide
minority
parties
such
as
the
in
and
the
progressive
faction
in
clamor
for
elections
when
out
of
power
but
are
not
at
all
certain
they
wish
to
be
controlled
by
popular
choice
when
in
power
in
power
tend
to
procrastinate
and
even
to
repudiate
the
electoral
process
tendency
to
treat
elections
as
an
instrument
of
rather
than
an
instrument
of
national
interest
had
two
important
effects
on
electoral
planning
in
the
central
level
the
scrutin
uninominal
voting
system
was
selected
over
some
form
of
the
scrutin
de
liste
system
even
though
the
latter
had
been
recommended
by
and
favored
by
all
political
parties
choice
of
the
single
member
district
was
dictated
to
a
certain
extent
by
problems
of
communication
and
understanding
in
the
more
remote
areas
of
the
country
but
it
also
served
to
minimize
the
national
political
value
of
the
elections
the
elections
were
for
local
officials
it
was
not
necessary
to
conduct
the
elections
so
as
to
prevent
parties
from
publicly
identifying
their
candidates
multiple
member
districts
the
still
fragmentary
local
party
organizations
could
have
operated
more
effectively
and
parties
might
have
been
encouraged
to
state
their
positions
more
clearly
parties
and
the
of
the
were
busily
at
work
after
the
elections
trying
to
unearth
the
political
affiliations
of
the
successful
candidates
and
thereby
give
the
elections
a
confidential
but
known
degree
of
national
political
significance
a
national
interpretation
cannot
be
avoided
it
is
unfortunate
that
the
elections
were
not
held
in
a
way
to
maximize
party
responsibility
and
the
educational
effect
of
mass
political
participation
general
setting
of
the
election
may
also
encourage
the
deterioration
of
local
party
organization
concentration
of
effective
power
in
leads
not
only
to
party
bickering
but
to
distraction
from
local
activity
that
might
have
had
many
auxiliary
benefits
in
addition
to
contributing
to
more
meaningful
elections
evidence
can
be
found
in
the
results
of
the
of
elections
which
took
place
three
weeks
before
national
elections
et
was
opposed
by
candidates
of
the
new
in
nearly
all
urban
centers
the
more
conservative
group
with
strong
backing
from
wealthy
businessmen
the
was
generally
favored
against
the
more
progressive
newer
party
campaigned
heavily
while
the
older
more
confident
party
expected
the
merchants
and
small
businessmen
to
support
them
as
they
had
done
for
many
years
local
and
offices
did
not
campaign
and
lost
heavily
value
of
the
elections
was
lost
both
as
an
experiment
in
increased
political
participation
and
as
a
reliable
indicator
of
commercial
interest
as
shown
in
of
elections
were
of
course
an
important
event
in
the
preparation
for
rural
commune
elections
learned
that
its
urban
organization
which
depends
heavily
on
support
was
most
effective
found
that
the
spontaneous
solidarity
of
the
independence
struggle
was
not
easily
transposed
to
the
more
concrete
precise
problems
of
internal
politics
overall
effect
was
probably
to
stimulate
more
party
activity
in
the
communal
elections
than
might
have
otherwise
taken
place
second
major
point
of
this
essay
is
to
examine
the
formal
arrangements
for
the
elections
a
somewhat
technical
subject
it
has
important
political
implications
as
the
above
discussion
of
the
voting
system
indicated
the
problems
and
solutions
devised
in
the
electoral
experiences
of
the
rapidly
changing
countries
are
often
of
comparative
value
and
essential
to
evaluating
election
results
sine
qua
non
of
the
elections
was
naturally
an
impartial
and
standardized
procedure
the
background
discussion
indicated
there
were
frequently
expressed
doubts
that
a
government
dominated
by
either
party
could
fairly
administer
elections
and
later
the
protected
the
privileged
position
until
the
fall
of
and
then
the
used
the
same
argument
which
it
had
previously
ignored
against
the
tendencies
of
the
government
bulk
of
the
preparation
had
of
course
proceeded
under
the
supervision
of
the
of
the
whose
officials
are
barred
from
party
activity
and
probably
generally
disinterested
in
party
politics
from
some
areas
of
recurring
trouble
like
where
inexperienced
officials
had
been
appointed
there
is
little
evidence
that
local
officials
intervened
in
the
electoral
process
however
the
administrative
problem
was
more
complex
and
the
sheer
prestige
of
office
was
very
likely
an
unfair
advantage
decided
to
remove
a
week
before
elections
and
to
institute
a
of
under
his
personal
direction
the
monarch
had
frequently
asserted
that
the
elections
were
to
be
without
party
significance
his
action
was
an
implicit
admission
that
party
identifications
were
a
factor
new
was
itself
inescapably
of
political
meaning
which
was
most
clearly
revealed
in
the
absence
of
any
members
and
the
presence
of
several
leaders
the
details
of
the
elections
were
settled
the
change
of
government
had
no
direct
effect
on
the
technical
aspects
of
the
elections
and
may
have
been
more
important
as
an
indication
of
royal
displeasure
with
the
preparations
began
in
the
fall
of
although
the
actual
demarcation
and
planning
for
the
rural
communes
was
completed
in
were
three
major
administrative
tasks
the
fixing
of
electoral
districts
the
registration
of
voters
and
the
registration
of
candidates
registration
began
in
late
and
continued
until
early
government
was
most
anxious
that
there
be
a
respectable
response
bulletins
of
the
accomplishment
in
each
province
made
the
registration
process
into
a
kind
of
competition
among
provincial
officials
goal
was
fixed
as
given
in
and
attention
focused
on
its
fulfillment
qualifications
to
vote
were
kept
very
simple
men
and
women
of
years
of
age
could
register
and
vote
upon
presenting
proof
of
residence
and
identification
were
liberal
provisions
for
dispensation
where
documents
or
records
were
lacking
police
were
disqualified
along
with
certain
categories
of
naturalized
citizens
criminals
and
those
punished
for
activities
registration
figures
given
in
must
be
interpreted
with
caution
since
the
estimate
for
eligible
electors
were
made
without
the
benefit
of
a
reliable
census
older
workers
who
have
no
expectation
of
securing
employment
in
the
occupation
in
which
they
are
skilled
should
be
able
to
secure
counseling
and
retraining
in
an
occupation

a
future

such
training

the
current
need

greatest

the

little
doubt
that

or
to
consider
whether
regional
or
national
demands
for
other
skills
might
provide
much
better
opportunities
for
the
youth
to
be
trained
the
current
information
on
what
types
of
training
are
needed
and
possible
is
too
limited
and
fragmentary
simply
is
not
enough
material
available
on
the
types
of
job
skills
that
are
in
demand
and
the
types
of
training
programs
that
are
required
or
most
suitable
of
the
available
information
comes
not
from
the
government
but
from
an
exchange
of
experiences
among
states
and
local
agencies
in
the
vocational
education
field
must
be
encouraged
to
adopt
a
wider
outlook
on
future
job
opportunities
is
a
need
for
an
expanded
effort
to
provide
research
and
information
to
help
guide
state
education
departments
and
local
school
boards
in
existing
programs
related
question
is
whether
unemployed
workers
can
be
motivated
to
take
the
training
provided
is
little
evidence
that
existing
public
or
private
training
programs
have
any
great
difficulty
getting
students
to
enroll
in
their
programs
even
though
they
must
pay
tuition
receive
no
subsistence
payments
and
are
not
guaranteed
a
job
there
always
is
some
limit
to
the
numbers
who
will
spend
the
time
and
effort
to
acquire
training
one
major
difficulty
is
the
local
focus
training
program
in
a
depressed
area
may
have
few
enrollees
unless
there
is
some
apparent
prospect
for
better
employment
opportunities
afterwards
and
the
prospect
may
be
poor
if
the
training
is
aimed
solely
at
jobs
in
the
local
community
there
is
adequate
information
on
job
opportunities
for
skilled
jobs
elsewhere
many
more
workers
can
be
expected
to
respond
problem
is
who
will
pay
for
the
training
school
districts
are
hard
pressed
financially
and
unenthusiastic
about
vocational
training
usually
are
expanded
only
when
outside
funds
are
available
or
local
business
leaders
demand
it
industrial
development
leaders
find
it
hard
to
win
local
support
for
training
unless
a
new
industry
is
in
sight
and
requests
it
governments
have
been
taking
the
lead
in
establishing
area
vocational
schools
but
their
focus
is
still
on
area
job
opportunities
the
government
is
likely
to
be
able
to
take
a
and
view
and
to
pay
for
training
to
meet
national
skilled
manpower
needs
only
state
funds
were
used
to
pay
for
the
vocational
education
it
could
be
argued
that
the
state
should
not
have
to
bear
the
cost
of
vocational
training
which
would
benefit
employers
in
other
states
if
funds
are
used
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
to
train
workers
for
jobs
which
could
be
obtained
elsewhere
as
well
as
for
jobs
in
the
area
of
chronic
unemployment
training
would
increase
the
tendency
of
workers
to
leave
the
area
and
find
jobs
in
other
localities
further
possibility
is
suggested
by
the
example
of
the
bills
and
also
by
some
recent
trends
in
attitudes
toward
improving
college
education
that
is
to
provide
financial
assistance
to
individuals
for
vocational
training
when
local
facilities
are
inadequate
probably
would
require
some
support
for
subsistence
as
well
as
for
tuition
but
the
total
would
be
no
greater
than
for
the
proposals
of
unemployment
compensation
or
a
maximum
of
per
year
per
student
would
enable
many
to
take
training
away
from
home
program
of
financial
assistance
would
permit
placing
emphasis
on
the
national
interest
in
training
highly
skilled
labor
of
being
limited
to
the
poor
training
facilities
in
remote
areas
the
student
would
be
able
to
move
to
large
institutions
of
concentrated
specialized
training
specialized
training
institutions
could
be
located
near
the
most
rapidly
growing
industries
where
the
equipment
and
job
experience
exist
and
where
the
future
employment
opportunities
are
located
would
heighten
possibilities
for
cooperative
and
extension
training
financial
assistance
would
enable
more
emphasis
to
be
placed
on
the
interests
of
the
individual
aptitudes
and
preferences
could
be
given
more
weight
in
selecting
the
proper
training
briefly
the
topping
configuration
must
be
examined
for
its
inferences
the
fact
that
the
lower
channel
line
was
pierced
had
further
forecasting
significance
then
the
application
of
the
count
rules
to
the
width
horizontally
of
the
configuration
gives
us
an
intial
estimate
of
the
probable
depth
of
the
decline
very
idea
of
there
being
count
rules
implies
that
there
is
some
sort
of
proportion
to
be
expected
between
the
amount
of
congestive
activity
and
the
extent
of
the
breakaway
run
up
or
run
down
movement
expectation
is
what
really
sold
point
and
figure
there
is
no
positive
and
consistently
demonstrable
relationship
in
the
strictest
sense
will
show
that
only
the
vaguest
generalities
apply
and
in
fine
these
merely
dwell
upon
a
relationship
between
the
durations
and
intensities
of
events
all
too
much
does
not
happen
too
suddenly
nor
does
very
little
take
long
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
these
two
types
of
charting
bar
charting
and
point
and
figure
charting
remain
the
subject
of
fairly
litigation
among
their
respective
professional
advocates
with
both
methods
enjoying
in
common
one
irrevocable
merit
are
both
methods
if
we
strip
their
respective
claims
to
the
barest
minimum
the
odds
still
favor
them
both
for
the
trend
in

always
more
likely
to
continue
than
to
reverse
course
many
more
things
are
charted
besides
prices
foregoing
have
been
methods
of
charting
prices
but
now
let
us
look
at
some
of
the
other
indices
that
are
customarily
charted
and
which
are
looked
to
for
their
forecasting

up
between
the

of

and
the

behind
this
is
of
course
fundamentalist
in
character
the
number
of
reported
freight
car
loadings
increased
this
was
taken
to
indicate
increased
industrial
activity
and
consequently
increased
stock

implying
fatter
dividends
and
implying
therefore
increased
stock
market
prices
now
know
that
things
rarely
ever
work
out
in
such
fashion
and
that
car
loadings
while
perhaps
interesting
enough
are
nevertheless
not
the
magic
formula
that
will
always
turn

the
quest
for
such
an
index
goes
on
ceaselessly
with
all

of
investors
and
speculators
participating
ranging
from
the
sedate

virtually
to
the
proverbial

all
seeking
doggedly
studiously
daily

often
nightly
for
the
enchanting
index
that
will
foretell
the
eternal

way
will
the
market
move
up
or

recalls
to
mind
the
quest
of
olden
times
for
the
fountain
of
youth
a
quest
heavily
invested

the
days
of

it

that

notwithstanding

it

in

that

the

of

now
puts
the
adage
on
a

basis
might
well
wonder
why
the

the
question
raised
is
about

awkward
as
the
one
concerned

first
it
really
that

criminal
about

after

anyone
imagine

put
to

during

only
upon

to
one
of

if
they

set
forth
at
the

of
this

first
to
introduce
the
reader
to
a
general
background
knowledge
of
the
various
types
and
capabilities
of
the
forecasting
methods
already
in
use
so
that
he
might
then
be
in
a
position
to
evaluate
for
himself
the
validity
of
the
rather
astonishing
empirical
correlation
that
is
to
follow
and
to
appraise
the
forecast
that
its
interpretation
suggests
for

for
analysts
of

much
of
the

the
general
level
of
business
activity
has
moved
along
on
a
plateau
but
there
have
been
persistent
signs
of
slack
in
the
economy

for
general

activity
to
soften
somewhat

becoming
more
evident
the
pause
in
the
advance
of
general
business
activity

year
has
thus
far
been
quite
modest
it
is
hard
to
escape
the
conclusion
that
the
softening
process
will
continue
into
the
first
quarter
of
and
possibly
somewhat
longer
is
difficult
to
see
any
powerful
sources
of
strength
on
the

the
country
usually
experienced
a
sharp
upturn
in
residential
construction
as
mortgage
financing
became
easier
to
obtain
this
time
however
there
are
signs
that
increased
availability
of
mortgage
credit
will
not
act
with
the
usual
speed
to
stimulate
a
sharp
rise
in
residential
construction
signs
are
the
inventories
of
unsold
houses
in
some
areas
of
the
country
and
the
moderate
rise
in
vacancy
rates
for
apartments
in
the
other
hand
in
a
more
favorable
vein
general
business
activity
should
receive
some
stimulus
from
rising
spending
and
the
reduction
in
business
inventories
has
probably
run
a
good
part
of
its
course
increase
in
retail
sales
in
to
a
high
is
encouraging
in
this
connection
as
well
as
the
most
recent
consumer
survey
by
the
which
shows
a
decided
pickup
in
consumer
spending
plans
pattern
of
general
business
activity
which
probably
lies
ahead
of
us
is
a
further
moderate
softening
through
the
spring
of
before
a
new
rise
in
economic
activity
gets
under
way
recovery
will
probably
be
sparked
by
a
rising
rate
of
housing
starts
next
spring
in
response
to
more
readily
available
mortgage
credit
as
well
as
by
an
expansion
of
spending
well
sustained
consumer
spending
and
some
rebuilding
of
business
inventories
downward
pressure
does
the
general
business
outlook
suggest
about
the
trend
of
rates
in
suggests
that
during
the
next
several
months
through
the
spring
of
the
demand
for
capital
funds
may
be
moderately
lower
and
that
interest
rates
may
tend
to
move
a
little
lower
especially
the
rates
on
state
and
local
bonds
as
well
as
those
on
publicly
offered
corporate
bonds
as
witnessed
by
the
large
corporate
bond
calendar
at
present
as
well
as
the
record
amount
of
municipal
bond
issues
approved
by
voters
the
demands
for
capital
funds
seem
likely
to
remain
high
so
that
any
downward
pressure
on
rates
from
reduced
demand
should
not
be
great
seems
likely
moreover
that
with
an
increase
in
the
rate
of
saving
in
mortgage
lending
institutions
interest
rates
on
residential
mortgages
may
move
somewhat
lower
through
the
spring
of
next
year
although
the
increased
ease
in
residential
mortgage
lending
may
occur
primarily
in
other
terms
than
interest
rate
easier
downpayment
and
amortization
terms
the
trend
of
general
business
activity
follows
the
pattern
suggested
here
we
are
likely
to
see
additional
steps
by
the
authorities
to
ease
the
availability
of
credit
a
further
reduction
in
the
discount
rate
would
be
a
strong
possibility
as
well
as
an
easier
reserve
position
for
the
banking
system
the
monetary
authorities
will
continue
to
be
required
to
pay
attention
to
the
consequences
of
their
actions
with
respect
to
our
international
balance
of
payments
position
and
the
outflow
of
gold
as
well
as
with
regard
to
avoiding
the
creation
of
excessive
liquidity
in
the

which
would
delay
the
effectiveness
of
monetary
policy
measures
in
the
next
expansion
phase
of
the
business
cycle
market
policy
of
the
most
intriguing
questions
is
whether
the
recent
departures
of
the
authorities
from
confining
their
open
market
operations
to
bills
will
spread
into
securities
in
the
next
few

that

its

conduct
its

operations
throughout
the
entire
maturity
range
of
securities
and
aggressively

to
force
down
interest
rates
principle
of
bills
only
or
bills
preferably
seems
so
strongly
accepted
by
the
that
it
is
difficult
to
envision
conditions
which
would
persuade
the
authorities
to
depart
radically
from
it
by
extending
their
open
market
purchases
regularly
into
securities
to
the
extent
that
the
monetary
authorities
in
their
effort
to
ease
credit
in
the
next
several
months
conduct
their
open
market
operations
in
bonds
they
will
certainly
act
to
accentuate
any
tendency
for
interest
rates
to
ease
as
a
result
of
market
forces
the
end
of
the
spring
of
assuming
that
a
general
business
recovery
gets
under
way
interest
rates
should
begin
to
edge
upward
again
depending
upon
the
vigor
of
the
recovery
and
the
determination
with
which
the
monetary
authorities
move
to
restrain
credit
availability
guess
would
be
that
interest
rates
will
decline
moderately
into
the
spring
of
and
during
the
second
half
of
the
year
will
turn
up
gradually
to
recover
the
ground
lost
during
the
downturn
is
pertinent
to
ask
the
question
the
long
upswing
of
interest
rates
during
the
past
years
just
about
run
its
course
and
are
we
now
entering
a
period
in
which
both
capital
market
forces
and
policies
will
produce
a
prolonged
decline
of
interest
rates
answer
is
in
the
negative
because
believe
that
total
capital
demands
during
the
will
continue
to
press
against
available
supplies
and
interest
rates
will
generally
tend
to
be
firm
at
high
levels
basic
forces
view
is
based
upon
several
basic
economic
forces
which
believe
will
be
operating
in
the
as
follows
events
in
the
of
the
confirm
that
the
cold
war
will
remain
with
us
and
probably
intensify
for
the
foreseeable
future
makes
it
certain
that
expenditures
for
military
preparedness
and
foreign
economic
aid
are
likely
to
rise
further
in
the
next
several
years
are
just
beginning
the
task
of
trying
to
win
or
maintain
the
friendship
of
the
new
nations
against
the
ruthless
competition
of
the
bloc
efforts
to
overcome
the
lead
of
the
in
space
are
bound
to
mean
accelerated
spending
it
is
likely
that
policies
aimed
at
stimulating
a
faster
rate
of
economic
growth
of
the
country
to
keep
ahead
of
the
countries
and
to
demonstrate
that
our
free
economic
system
is
better
than
theirs
will
lead
to
rising
spending
in
certain
areas
such
as
education
housing
medical
aid
and
the
like
are
serious
dangers
involved
in
this
trend
toward
rising
expenditures
of
which
take
a
dim
view
but
it
seems
very
likely
to
occur
the
we
have
the
prospect
of
a
significant
stepping
up
in
the
rate
of
household
formations
which
should
contribute
to
a
rising
volume
of
consumer
expenditures
and
home
building
to
the
latest
projections
of
the
of
the
the
annual
rate
of
household
formations
will
increase
for
the
next
years
the
most
favorable
assumptions
for
increase
the
of
the
projects
that
the
annual
rate
of
household
formations
will
rise
from
about
in
the
last
two
years
of
the
to
an
annual
rate
of
about
in
the
first
five
years
of
the
and
to
a
slightly
higher
annual
rate
of
in
the
second
half
of
the
decade
the
the
projections
show
a
more
pronounced
rise
to
an
annual
rate
of
in
the
second
half
of
that
decade
the
expanding
markets
for
consumer
goods
and
housing
occasioned
by
the
higher
rate
of
household
formation
should
enhance
the
general
economic
prospects
of
the
the
impact
of
a
rising
rate
of
household
formation
this
decade
should
not
be
exaggerated
average
annual
rate
of
in
the
second
half
of
the
is
still
considerably
below
the
annual
rate
of
in
the
period
from
to
the
expansion
of
family
formation
in
the
a
continued
substantial
rise
in
expenditures
by
state
and
local
government
units
seems
to
be
indicated
is
an
area
in
which
there
is
still
a
large
backlog
of
demand
and
local
expenditures
in
real
terms
increased
persistently
from
in
to
in
and
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
they
showed
a
comparable
increase
in
this
decade
which
would
carry
them
to
the
neighborhood
of
by
would
be
a
powerful
force
for
raising
business
activity
seems
likely
that
with
the
three
preceding
forces
at
play
the
rate
of
business
and
industrial
plant
and
equipment
expenditures
should
continue
to
move
upward
from
the
levels
of
the
by
keen
competition
in
our
industrial
system
and
still
further
increases
in
the
funds
devoted
to
industrial
research
plant
and
equipment
expenditures
by
business
and
industry
should
rise
during
the
decade
a
more
pessimistic
vein
about
the
economic
outlook
suspect
that
the
reservoir
of
demand
for
consumer
goods
and
housing
which
was
during
the
and
is
finally
in
the
process
of
running
dry
is
some
evidence
of
this
example
the
huge
postwar
demand
on
the
part
of
veterans
for
housing
under
the
home
loan
guaranty
program
seems
to
have
largely
exhausted
itself
the
failure
of
as
a
whole
to
respond
this
year
to
somewhat
greater
availability
of
mortgage
financing
and
the
increasing
reports
of
pockets
of
unsold
homes
and
rising
vacancy
rates
in
apartment
buildings
may
also
signal
in
part
that
the
lush
days
of
big
backlog
demand
for
housing
are
reaching
an
end
a
way
we
may
be
witnessing
the
same
thing
in
the
sales
of
automobiles
today
as
the
public
no
longer
is
willing
to
purchase
any
car
coming
on
the
market
but
is
more
insistent
on
compact
cars
free
of
the
frills
which
were
accepted
in
the
huge
backlog
of
demand
which
was
evident
in
the
first
decade
and
a
half
after
the
was
fed
by
liquid
assets
accumulated
by
the
public
during
the
and
even
more
so
by
the
easier
and
easier
credit
in
the
consumer
loan
and
home
loan
fields
consuming
public
has
used
up
a
good
part
of
these
liquid
assets
or
they
have
been
drained
by
the
rising
price
level
and
we
have
apparently
gotten
to
the
end
of
the
line
in
making
consumer
or
home
mortgage
terms
easier
is
not
to
say
that
the
level
of
consumer
expenditures
will
not
continue
to
rise
in
the
am
confident
that
it
will
but
consumer
spending
in
the
will
not
be
fortified
by
the
great
backlog
of
wants
and
desires
which
characterized
most
of
the
should
become
more
competitive
as
consumers
become
more
selective
capital
requirements
during
the
our
national
economy
is
likely
to
grow
at
as
fast
a
rate
as
in
the
and
in
the
process
to
require
enormous
amounts
of
capital
funds
policies
of
industry
are
the
result
of
a
complex
of
forces
no
single
explanation
has
been
found
which
applies
to
all
cases
purpose
of
this
paper
is
to
analyze
one
possible
force
which
has
not
been
treated
in
the
literature
but
which
we
believe
makes
a
significant
contribution
to
explaining
the
behavior
of
a
few
very
important
industries
there
may
be
several
such
industries
to
which
the
model
of
this
paper
is
applicable
the
authors
make
particular
claim
of
relevance
to
the
explanation
of
the
course
of
wages
and
prices
in
the
steel
industry
of
the
since
the
apparent
stiffening
of
the
attitude
in
the
recent
steel
strike
has
a
direct
explanation
in
terms
of
the
model
here
presented
model
of
this
paper
considers
an
industry
which
is
not
characterized
by
vigorous
price
competition
but
which
is
so
basic
that
its
policies
are
held
in
check
by
continuous
critical
public
scrutiny
the
product
price
has
been
kept
below
the
and
prices
due
to
fears
of
public
reaction
the
profit
seeking
producers
have
an
interest
in
offering
little
real
resistance
to
wage
demands
contribution
of
this
paper
is
a
demonstration
of
this
proposition
and
an
exploration
of
some
of
its
implications
order
to
focus
clearly
upon
the
operation
of
this
one
force
which
we
may
call
the
effect
of
pricing
on
key
wage
bargains
we
deliberately
simplify
the
model
by
abstracting
from
other
forces
such
as
union
power
which
may
be
relevant
in
an
actual
situation
expository
purposes
this
is
best
treated
as
a
model
which
spells
out
the
conditions
under
which
an
important
industry
affected
with
the
public
interest
would
find
it
profitable
to
raise
wages
even
in
the
absence
of
union
pressures
for
higher
wages
below
describes
this
abstract
model
by

its
assumptions
discusses
the
operation
of
the
model
and
derives
some
significant
conclusions

the
empirical
relevance
and

of

a
brief
summary
presents
the
rigorous
argument
but
is
best
read
after
in
order
that
the
assumptions
underlying
the
equations
may
be
explicit
the
assumptions
of
the
model
industry
industry
with
which
this
model
is
concerned
is
a
basic
industry
producing
a
substantial
share
of
gross
national
product
competition
is
lacking
the
purposes
of
setting
the
product
price
the
industry
behaves
as
a
single
entity
wage
negotiations
the

bargains
as
a
unit
with
a

union
demand

manner
in
which
this
is
shared
among
firms
is
taken
as
given
any
given
time
period
the
aggregate
demand
for
the
product
is
determined
by
two
things
the
price
charged
by
the
industry
and
the
level
of
the

of
this
discussion
the
problem
of

encompassed
in
these

form
of

one
which
makes
quantity

vary
inversely
with
the
product

and
vary
directly
with
the
level
of

price
policy
industry
of
this
model
is
so
important
that
its
wage
and
price
policies
are
affected
with
a
public
interest
of
its
importance
and
because
the
lack
of
price
competition
is
well
recognized
the
industry
is
under
considerable
public
pressure
not
to
raise
its
price
any
more
than
could
be
justified
by
cost
increases
threat
of
effective
action
provoked
by
gouging
the
public
through
price
increases
not
justified
by
cost
increases
and
fears
of
endangering
relations
with
customers
the
general
public
and
the
press
all
operate
to
keep
price
increases
in
some
relation
to
cost
increases
the
industry
of
this
model
the
effect
of
such
public
pressures
in
the
past
has
been
to
hold
the
price
well
below
the
price
given
the
wage
rate
and
the
level
of
and
even
below
the
price
but
not
below
average
cost
such
an
industry
it
is
only
safe
to
raise
its
price
if
such
an
increase
is
manifestly
justified
by
rising
costs
due
to
rising
wages
if
public
pressure
sets
the
effective
limit
to
the
price
that
the
industry
may
charge
this
pressure
is
itself
a
function
of
the
wage
rate
this
model
we
abstract
from
all
sources
of
cost
changes
so
that
the
price
only
rises
as
the
wage
rate
rises
such
circumstances
it
may
well
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
industry
to
allow
an
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
marginal
costs
rise
when
the
wage
rate
rises
the
price
also
rises
when
the
price
is
elevated
and
is
likely
to
remain
well
above
the
latter
price
will
also
be
raised
for
potential
domestic
competition
but
unless
general
inflation
permits
profit
margins
to
increase
proportionately
throughout
the
economy
we
might
expect
the
price
to
approach
the
price
price
would
be
approached
more
rapidly
since
domestic
do
not
enter
foreign
costs
directly
this
approach
becomes
critical
the
industry
can
be
expected
to
put
much
emphasis
on
this
as
evidence
of
its
sincerity
in
resisting
the
wage
pressures
of
a
powerful
union
requesting
tariff
relief
after
it
has
reluctantly
acceded
to
the
union
pressure
or
not
it
is
in
the
interest
to
allow
the
basic
wage
rate
to
rise
obviously
depends
upon
the
extent
to
which
the
price
rises
in
response
to
a
basic
wage
increase
and
the
relation
of
this
response
to
the
increase
in
costs
accompanying
the
wage
increase
extent
to
which
the
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
itself
a
function
of
three
things
the
passage
of
time
the
level
of
and
the
size
of
the
wage
increase
are
abstracting
from
the
fact
of
strikes
here
but
it
should
be
obvious
that
the
extent
to
which
the
price
is
raised
by
a
given
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
is
also
a
function
of
the
show
of
resistance
put
up
by
the
industry
industry
may
deliberately
take
a
strike
not
to
put
pressure
on
the
union
but
in
order
to
educate
the
government
and
the
customers
of
the
industry
a
strike
continues
these
parties
increase
their
pressure
on
the
industry
to
reach
an
agreement
become
increasingly
willing
to
accept
the
price
increase
that
the
industry
claims
the
wage
bargain
would
entail
indignation
and
resistance
to
increases
is
obviously
much
less
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
per
annum
than
when
the
increases
are
on
the
order
of
per
month
simple
passage
of
an
additional
eleven
time
makes
the
second
boost
more
acceptable
the
price
is
raised
further
by
a
given
wage
increase
the
longer
it
has
been
since
the
previous
price
increase
however
that
the
passage
of
time
does
not
permit
the
raising
of
prices
per
se

itself

vigorously

from

and
wage
increases
to

we
abstract
from
these

here
our
present
purposes
we
assume
that
the
sole
subject
of

is
the
basic

including

or
adjustments
and
it
is
this

something

the

the

the
problem
of
agreeing
how
an
increase
in

related
to
a

should
be
shared

of
conflict
and
of
vigorous

for
an
increase
in
money
wages
does
not
contradict
the
assumption
that
the
union
is
willing
to
settle
for
and
increases
as
distinct
from
a
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
assume
further
that
the
union
recognizes
the
possibility
that
increases
may
offset
increases
and
it
does
not
entirely
disregard
the
effect
of
price
increases
arising
from
its
own
wage
increases
upon
the
real
wage
rate
internal
political
reasons
the
union
asks
for
and
accepts
increases
in
the
basic
wage
rate
and
would
vigorously
oppose
a
reduction
in
this
rate
but
the
adjustment
of
the
basic
wage
rate
upwards
is
essentially
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
companies
of
the
industry
in
the
basic
wage
rate
are
and
they
constitute
an
argument
for
raising
prices
it
is
not
known
to
either
the
union
or
the
public
precisely
how
much
of
a
cost
increase
is
caused
by
a
given
change
in
the
basic
wage
rate
although
the
companies
are
presumed
to
have
reliable
estimates
of
this
magnitude
this
model
then
the
industry
is
presumed
to
realize
that
they
could
successfully
resist
a
change
in
the
basic
wage
rate
but
since
such
a
change
is
the
only
effective
means
to
raising
prices
they
may
in
circumstances
to
be
spelled
out
in
below
find
it
to
their
advantage
to
allow
the
wage
rise
for
changes
in
the
basic
wage
rate
the
industry
becomes
the
active
since
any
increase
in
the
basic
wage
rate
can
occur
only
by
reason
of
industry
acquiescence
presumption
in
the
literature
would
appear
to
be
that
the
basic
wage
rate
would
be
unchanged
in
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
clearly
not
in
the
interest
of
the
industry
to
raise
wages
gratuitously
this
presumption
it
is
an
easy
step
to
the
conclusion
that
any
observed
increases
in
the
basic
wage
rate
must
be
due
to
union
behavior
different
and
more
aggressive
than
assumed
in
our
model
is
this
conclusion
that
we
challenge
we
do
so
by
disproving
the
presumption
on
which
it
is
based
the
operation
of
the
model
is
convenient
to
assume
that
the
contract
is
of
one

convenient
starting

both
epitomized

for

by
a
number
of

scholars
emphasis
was
put
upon
the
fact
that
international
law
was
the
law
of
civilized
nations
and
the
great
early
scholars
repeatedly
made
use
of
this
phrase
or
of
nations
which
is
a
substantial
equivalent
stated
that
the
public
law
was
essentially
limited
to
the
civilized
and
peoples
of
or
to
those
of

it
had
always
been
of
origin
in
fact
but
it
had
maintained
a
universal
outlook
under
the
natural
law
theory
with
virtually
every
writer
not
only
was
the
origin
of
public
law
acknowledged
as
a
historical
phenomenon
but
the
rules
thus
established
by
the
advanced
civilizations
of
were
to
be
imposed
on
others

on
which
international

must
do
something
with
the
acquiescence
of
the

or
some
of
them
which
amounts
to
an
acceptance
of
the
law
in
its
entirety
beyond
all
possibility
of
misconstruction
the
nineteenth
century
these
views
were
protested
by
virtually
all
the
writers
though
ineffectively
just
as
the
new
nations
of
and

them
with
more
effect
today
number
of
other
developments
contributed
to
the
transmutation
of
the
law
of
nations
into
international
law
that
is
from
aspects
of
a
universal
system
of
into
particular
rules
governing
the
relations
of
sovereign
states
difference
is
important
for
although
the
older
law
of
nations
did
cover
relationships
among
sovereigns
this
was
by
no
means
its
exclusive
domain
law
of
nature
governed
sovereigns
in
their
relationship
to
their
own
citizens
to
foreigners
and
to
each
other
in
a
conceptually
unified
system
theory
of
international
law
which
in
the
nineteenth
century
became
common
to
virtually
all
writers
in
and
broke
this
unity
and
this
universality
lost
sight
of
the
individual
almost
entirely
and
confined
itself
to
rules
limiting
the
exercise
of
state
power
for
reasons
essentially
unconnected
with
justice
or
morality
save
as
these
values
might
affect
international
relations

did
the
sovereign
look
to
the
law
of
nations
to
determine
what
he
ought
to
do
his
search
was
merely
for
rules
that
might
limit
his
freedom
of
action
appreciate
this
development
we
must
relate
it
to
other
aspects
of
philosophy
and
most
obvious
was
the
growing
nationalism
and
the
tendency
to
regard
the
state
and
the
identification
with
the
state
as
transcending
other
ties
of
social
solidarity
identification
was
not
new
but
it
was
accelerating
in
intensity
and
scope
throughout
as
new
unifications
occurred

its
ultimate
philosophical
statement

notions
of

the

although
political
philosophers
will
recognize
its
origins

the
rejected
doctrines
of
identification
was
reflected
jurisprudentially
in
law
theories
which
incorporated
this
abstraction
and
saw
law
domestic
and
international
simply
as
its
formal
reflection
the
international
community
this
reduced
law
to
state
the
highest
form
of
human
organization
in
fact
and
theory
could
be
subjected
to
only
by
a
manifestation
of
or
consent
to
the
new
theories
the
nineteenth
century
corporate
sovereign
was
sovereign
in
a
quite
new
and
different
sense
from
his
historical
predecessors
no
longer
sought
to
find
the

he
made
it
he
could
be
subjected

he

that

or

states
behind
abstractions
were
more
practical
reasons
for
a
changing
jurisprudence
to
but
distinguishable
from
nationalism
was
the
growth
of
democracy
in
one
form
or
another
participation
in
politics
and
the
demands
of
various
groups
for
status
and
recognition
had
dramatic
effects
upon
law
institutions
efforts
of
various
interest
groups
to
control
or
influence
governmental
decisions
particularly
when
taken
in
conjunction
with
the
impact
of
industralization
led
to
a
concentration
of
attention
on
the
legislative
power
and
the
means
whereby
policy
could
be
formulated
and
enforced
as
law
through
bureaucratic
institutions
became
a
conscious
process
something
more
than
simply
doing
justice
and
looking
to
local
customs
and
a
common
morality
for
applicable
norms
was
this
true
when
the
norms
previously
applied
were
no
longer
satisfactory
to
many
when
customs
were
rapidly
changing
as
the
forces
of
the
new
productivity
were
harnessed
old
way
of
doing
things
which
depended
on
a
relatively
stable
community
with
stable
ideas
dealing
with
familiar
situations
was
no
longer
adequate
to
the
task
was
the
period
of
codification
of
existing
law
the
in
and
the
peculiar
codification
that
in
fact
resulted
from
restatement
and
ordering
of
the

was
followed
in
all
countries
by
a
growing
amount
of
legislation
some
changing
and
adjusting
the
older
law
much
dealing
with
entirely
new
situations
legislative
mills
have
been
grinding
ever
since
and
when
its
cumbersome
processes
were
no
longer
adequate
to
the
task
a
limited
legislative
authority
was
delegated
in
one
form
or
another
to
the
executive
the
eighteenth
century
had
been
a
time
in
which
man
sought
justice
the
nineteenth
and
twentieth
have
been
centuries
in
which
men
are
satisfied
with
law
with
developed
positivism
the
separation
of
law
from
justice
or
from
morality
generally
became
quite
specific
municipal
systems
we
tend
to
view
what
is
called
positivism
as
fundamentally
a
movement
to
democratize
policy
by
increasing
the
power
of
parliament
the
elected
representatives
at
the
expense
of
the
more
conservative
judiciary
the
power
of
the
latter
was
made
both
limited
and
explicit
when
norms
were
clarified
and
made
more
precise
and
the
creation
of
new
norms
was
placed
exclusively
in
parliamentary
hands
two
purposes
were
served
was
made
subservient
to
an
institutionalized
popular
will
and
law
became
a
rational
system
for
implementing
that
will
for
serving
conscious
goals
for
embodying
the
public
policy
is
true
that
initially
the
task
was
to
remove
restrictions
that
it
was
thought
inhibited
the
free
flow
of
money
goods
and
labor
but
even
was
a
conscious
policy
was
seen
as
an
emanation
of
the
sovereign
will
the
sovereign
was
not
absolute
monarch
but
rather
the
parliamentary
sovereign
of
was
too
an
optimistic
philosophy
and
though
it
separated
law
from
morality
it
was
by
no
means
an
immoral
or
amoral
one
through
democratic
institutions
of
government
and
economic
freedom
was
master
of
his
destiny
theory
did
not
require
though
it
unfortunately
might
acquire
a
mystique
was
merely
a
rationalization
and
ordering
of
new
institutions
of
popular
government
was
not
opposed
to
either
justice
or
morality
it
merely
wished
to
minimize
subjective
views
of
officials
who
wielded
public
authority
was
this
true
as
capitalism
became
the
dominant
credo
of
society
free
the
factors
of
production
was
a
major
objective
of
the
rising
bourgeoisie
and
this
objective
required
that
governmental
authority
administrative
officials
and
judges
be
limited
as
precisely
and
explicitly
as
possible
that
old
customs
which
inhibited
trade
be
abrogated
that
business
be
free
from
governmental
supervision
and
notions
of
morality
which
might
clog
the
automatic
adjustments
of
the
free
market
that
obligations
of
status
that
were
inconsistent
with
the
new
politics
and
the
new
economics
be
done
away
with
conceived
as
the
free
bargain
of
formal
equals
replaced
the
implied
obligations
of
a
more
static
and
society
contract
was
the
dominant
legal
theme
of
the
century
the
touchstone
of
the
free
society
itself
was
based
upon
contract
business
organization
the
corporation
was
analyzed
in
contractual
terms
trade
was
based
on
freedom
of
contract
and
money
was
lent
and
borrowed
on
contractual
terms
even
marriage
and
the
family
was
seen
as
a
contractual
arrangement
is
not
surprising
that
the
international
obligations
of
states
were
also
viewed
in
terms
of
contract
fact
some
is
the
principle
example
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
all
international
law
could
be
traced
to
the
single
legal
norm

displacement
at
least
to
a
considerable
extent
of
the
ethical
jurisprudence
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
by
positivism
reshaped
both
international
law
theory
and
doctrine
the
first
place
the
new
doctrine
brought
a
formal
separation
of
international
from
municipal
law
rejecting
the
earlier
view
that
both
were
parts
of
a
universal
legal
system
result
was
to
nationalize
much
that
had
been
regarded
as
the
law
of

the
law

and
the
host
of
problems
which
arise
in
private
litigation
because
of
some

all
severed
from

change

not
quite
so
dramatic
as
it
sounds
because
in
fact
common
norms
continued
to
be
invoked
by
municipal
courts
and
were
only
gradually
changed
by
legislation

seriously
impeded
the

reacted
with
a
series
of
measures
modifying
in
various
ways
what
it
had
granted
in
it
required
the
convening
of
a
special
court
for
the
issuance
of
certain
injunctions
and
allowed
direct
appeals
to
the
legislation
was
clarified
and
extended
from
time
to
time
thereafter
an
abortive
provision
was
made
for
the
stay
of
federal
injunction
proceedings
upon
institution
of
state
court
test
cases
essential
ineffectiveness
of
these
measures
resulted
in
in
substantial
elimination
of
federal
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
state
public
utility
rate
orders
years
later
similar
restraints
were
imposed
upon
injunctions
against
collection
of
state

saved
for
state
adjudication
in
the
first
instance
the
two
major
areas
where
federal
injunctions
had
been
most
obnoxious
but
other
areas
remained
vulnerable
the
like
showed
misgivings
concerning
this
aspect
of
government
by
injunction
upon
the
traditional
discretion
of
the
chancellor
introduced
a
series
of
judicial
restraints
that
culminated
in
famous
doctrine
of
abstention
the
earlier
cases
turned
rather
narrowly
upon
the
availability
of
adequate
state
remedies
the
new
emphasis
is
upon
the
nature
of
the
state
policy
at
issue
classic
case
is
commission
had
issued
an
administrative
order
which
was
challenged
as
discriminatory
against
enforcement
was
enjoined
by
a
federal
trial
court
review
the
via
found
southern
racial
problems
a
sensitive
area
of
social
policy
on
which
the
federal
courts
ought
not
to
enter
unless
no
alternative
to
adjudication
is
open
alternative
was
found
in
the
vagueness
of
state
law
as
to
whether
the
offending
order
had
in
fact
been
authorized
as
usual
to
interpret
state
legislation
such
interpretation
can
only
be
a
forecast
rather
than
a
determination
led
a
unanimous
to
vacate
the
injunction
it
is
crucial
that
here
unlike
the
trial
court
was
ordered
to
retain
the
case
until
the
state
courts
had
had
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
settle
the
question
resources
of
equity
are
equal
to
an
adjustment
that
will
avoid
the
waste
of
a
tentative
decision
as
well
as
the
friction
of
a
premature
constitutional
adjudication
abstention
postponement
is
one
thing
refusal
to
adjudicate
is
another
the
extent
that
the
jurisdictional
principle
of
stands
unmodified
by
subsequent
legislation
federal
equitable
relief
against
state
action
must
be
available
or
so
it
seems
to
the
commission
had
refused
to
permit
abandonment
of
certain
uneconomic
train
facilities
railroad
claiming
deprivation
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
sought
injunctive
relief
held
that
federal
jurisdiction
should
not
be
exercised
lest
the
domestic
policy
of
the
state
be
obstructed
this
in
the
name
of
equitable
discretion
and
concurred
in
the
result
for
they
found
no
merit
in
the
claim
they
objected
vigorously
to
the
proposition
that
federal
courts
may
refuse
to
exercise
jurisdiction
conferred
in
a
valid
act
of
one
fell
swoop
the
now
finds
that
indulged
in
needless
legislation
in
the
acts
of
and
these
measures
so
the
in
effect
now
decides
gave
not
only
needless
but
inadequate
relief
since
it
now
appears
that
the
federal
courts
have
inherent
power
to
sterilize
the
of
against
all
proceedings
challenging
local
regulation
most
revealing
recent
case
is
gave
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
suits
for
violation
of
contracts
between
an
employer
and
a
labor
organization
representing
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
its
face
this
merely
provides
a
federal
forum
it
does
not
establish
any
law
rights
for
the
federal
judges
to
enforce
can
judges
exercise
jurisdiction
to
enforce
national
rights
when
has
created
none
held
that
had
intended
the
federal
judiciary
to
fashion
an
appropriate
law
of
contracts
short
congressional
power
to
grant
authority
to
federal
courts
is
now
apparently
so
broad
that
need
not
create
or
specify
the
right
to
be
enforced
decision
authorizes
a
whole
new
body
of
federal
common
law
which
as
pointed
out
in
dissent
leads
to
one
of
the
following
incongruities
conflict
in
federal
and
state
court
interpretations
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
displacement
of
state
law
by
federal
law
in
state
courts
in
all
actions
regarding
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
exclusion
of
state
court
jurisdiction
over
these
matters
elaborate
examination
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
provision
in
question
suggests
that
purpose
was
merely
to
make
unions
suable
a
few
exceptions
the
lawmakers
seemed
unaware
of
the
technical
problems
of
federal
jurisdiction
involved
to
say
nothing
of
the
delegation
of
lawmaking
power
to
judges
avoid
these
constitutional
difficulties
was
prepared
to
read
the
provision
as
concerned
with
diversity
rather
than
federal
question
jurisdiction
would
satisfy
what
presumably
was
major
purpose
the
suability
of
unions
would
also
leave
intact
the
traditional
authority
in
the
realm
of
contract
law
we
have
seen
the
and
decisions
require
federal
courts
in
diversity
cases
to
follow
state
decisional
rules
again
could
not
lightly
accept
the
principle
of
wholesale
judicial
legislation
wants
to
displace
the
states
from
areas
which
they
have
customarily
occupied
let
it
do
so
knowingly
and
explicitly
let
it
do
its
own
lawmaking
and
not
leave
that
to
federal
judges
suggest
that
if
granted
jurisdiction
over
interstate
divorce
cases
the
federal
courts
would
be
authorized
to
fashion
a
national
law
for
the
dissolution
of
marriages
is
a
common
problem
behind
most
of
these
federal
question
and
diversity
cases
has
not
clearly
defined
the
bounds
between
state
and
federal
court
competence
has
the
power
to
do
so
but
for
the
most
part
has
left
the
matter
for
solution
by
judges
on
a
basis
careful
student
has
suggested
that
any
new
revision
of
the
the
legislators
would
do
well
to
remember
that
the
allocation
of
power
to
the
federal
courts
should
be
limited
to
those
matters
in
which
their
expertise
in
federal
law
might
be
used
leaving
to
the
state
judiciaries
the
primary
obligation
of
pronouncing
state
law
the
goal
here
proposed
is
the
guiding
principle
in
opinions
to
the
extent
that
leaves
the
problem
to
judicial
discretion
same
rule
of
specialization
and
division
of
labor
guides
him
in
the
certiorari
cases
in
the
administrative
law
area
and
indeed
in
the
whole
realm
of
judicial
review
no
doubt
concurs
in
principle
but
is
more
apt
to
make
exceptions
to
achieve
a
generous
and
just
result
will
not
be
fooled
by
technicalities
review
of
state
decisions
few
exceptions
has
not
given
federal
courts
exclusive
authority
to
enforce
rights
arising
under
federal
law
put
it
differently
state
and
federal
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
most
claims
of
federal
right
insure
uniformity
in
the
meaning
of
national
law
however
state
interpretations
are
subject
to
review
may
be
noted
parenthetically
that
to
evade
desegregation
an
and
former
southern
governor
has
urged
to
abolish
this
reviewing
authority
result
of
course
would
be
that
federal
law
inevitably
would
mean
different
things
in
different
states
would
also
probably
mean
different
things
within
the
same
state
depending
upon
what
court
state
or
federal
rendered
decision
consider
here
only
a
few
of
many
problems
involved
in
this
crucial
relationship
first
is
that
enforcement
of
national
law
in
state
litigation
raises
in
reverse
the
old
diversity
puzzle
of
the
relation
of
procedure
to
substance
to
certain
constitutional
restraints
in
favor
of
fair
trials
each
level
of
government
is
free
to
devise
its
own
judicial
procedures
who
choose
to
assert
federal
claims
in
a
state
court
go
into
that
court
subject
to
its
rules
of
procedure
similar
canon
applies
to
those
who
press
state
claims
in
federal
tribunals
in
diversity
cases
an
controversy
the
state
court
followed
established
state
procedure
by
construing
a
vague
complaint
most
strongly
against
the
complainant
other
words
the
burden
of
pleading
clearly
rested
upon
the
pleader
by
state
law
result
was
that
the
case
was
dismissed
led
a
reversing
majority
local
rules
of
pleading
cannot
be
used
to
impose
unnecessary
burdens
upon
rights
of
recovery
authorized
by
federal
law
as
in
the
case
another
element
of
state
procedure
was
subsumed
to
federal
law
and
dissented
may
cherish
formalities
more
than
another
one
may
be
more
responsive
than
another
to
procedural
reforms
a
litigant
chooses
to
enforce
a
right
in
a
court
he
cannot
be
heard
to
object
if
he
is
treated
exactly
as
are
plaintiffs
who
press
like
claims
arising
under
law
with
regard
to
the
form
in
which
the
claim
must
be
stated
the
particularity
for
instance
with
which
a
cause
of
action
must
be
described
law
though
invoked
in
a
court
delimits
the
claim
defines
what
gives
a
right
to
recovery
and
what
goes
to
prove
it
the
form
in
which
the
claim
must
be
stated
need
not
be
different
from
what
the
exacts
in
the
enforcement
of
like
obligations
created
by
it
so
long
as
a
requirement
does
not
add
to
or
diminish
the
right
as
defined
by
law
nor
burden
the
realization
of
this
right
in
the
actualities
of
litigation
problem
in
the
area
of
relationships
is
this
what
constitutes
reversible
error
in
a
state
decision
involved
a
conviction
for
disorderly
conduct
under
a
local
ordinance
conduct
in
question
was
a
speech
accused
did
not
object
to
the
trial
charge
to
the
jury
that
discourse
may
constitute
a
breach
of
the
peace
if
it
stirs
the
public
to
anger
invites
dispute
brings
about
a
condition
of
unrest
present
purposes
it
may
be
assumed
that
this
charge
so
narrowly
limited
speech
as
to
violate
the
federal
the
accused
raised
many
other
objections
he
did
not
object
on
this
crucial
point
at
any
stage
of
the
proceedings
is
he
did
not
claim
in
any
of
the
four
courts
through
which
his
case
progressed
that
the
jury
charge
had
denied
him
any
federal
right
else
can
one
explain
for
example
allowing
the
survival
of
the
right
to
amortize
bond
discount
and
premium
section
but
not
the
right
to
amortize
bond
issue
expenses
or
allowing
a
deduction
for
payment
of
certain
obligations
of
a
transferor
assumed
in
the
reorganization
section
but
not
a
deduction
for
theft
losses
sustained
by
a
transferor
prior
to
a
reorganization
but
discovered
after
it
or
requiring
a
transferor
to
carry
over
its
method
of
depreciation
section
but
not
allowing
rapid
amortization
of
emergency
facilities
transferred
in
a
reorganization
or
allowing
survival
of
a
dividend
carryover
to
a
personal
holding
company
section
but
not
carryover
of
excess
tax
credits
for
foreign
taxes
items
and
most
of
the
others
listed
above
seem
quite
comparable
to
items
whose
right
of
survival
is
provided
for
in
section
does
not
seem
to
be
any
reasonable
basis
for
distinction
either
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
tax
attribute
or
in
terms
of
possibilities
respect
to
items
such
as
these
the
provisions
of
section
viewed
in
historical
perspective
suggest
a
rule
requiring
survival
whether
the
items
are
beneficial
or
detrimental
to
the
surviving
corporation
this
extent
some
stretching
of
the
literal
meaning
of
the
seems
justified
since
the
literal
meaning
conflicts
with
the
clear
implication
if
not
the
language
of
the
statute
is
not
contended
that
section
should
prescribe
the
survival
of
all
of
the
tax
attributes
an
interpretation
could
not
be
justified
by
a
construction
of
the
statute
alone
it
would
certainly
violate
the
intention
of
as
expressed
in
the
and
in
at
least
one
instance
involving
refund
claims
it
might
be
contrary
to
another
provision
of
the
claims
of
the
voids
an
assignment
of
a
claim
against
the
unless
made
after
it
has
been
allowed
the
amount
due
has
been
ascertained
and
a
warrant
for
its
payment
has
been
issued
it
were
not
for
judicial
development
of
certain
exceptions
this
section
would
prohibit
a
suit
for
refund
by
an
acquiring
corporation
for
taxes
paid
by
a
transferor
corporation
even
though
the
reorganization
meets
the
requirements
of

clearly
recognized
exception
is
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
leading
case
held
that
the
transferee
could
sue
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
transferor
and
it
has
been
consistently
followed
said
the
purpose
of
the
section
was
principally
to
spare
the
the
embarrassment
and
trouble
of
dealing
with
several
parties
one
of
them
a
stranger
to
the
claim
and
to
prevent
traffic
in
claims
particularly
tenuous
claims
against
the
reason

the
applied
to
the
case
at
hand
furthermore
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
intended

by
the
states
exceptions
are
assignments
for
the
benefit
of
creditors
corporate
dissolutions
transfers

are
often
classified
as
transfers
by
operation
of
law
reorganization
not
complying
with
the
merger
or
consolidation
statutes
of
the
states
involved
is
difficult
to
fit
into
an
operation
of
law
mold
it
is
in
some
ways
comparable
to
a
voluntary
sale
of
assets
for
cash
to
which
section
quite
clearly
applies
the
courts
and
have
held
that
acquiring
corporations
in
several
types
of
reorganizations
may
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
transferors
recent
case
in
point
is
in
which
a
claim
against
the
was
transferred
first
from
a
corporation
to
a
partnership
whose
partners
were
former
stockholders
and
then
to
another
corporation
formed
by
the
partners
the
final
corporation
entitled
to
sue
on
the
claim
the
cited
the
and
cases
for
the
proposition
that
transfers
by
operation
of
law
or
in
conjunction
with
changes
of
corporate
structure
are
not
assignments
prohibited
by
the
statute
an
earlier
case
an
corporation
was
formed
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
the
stock
of
a
corporation
in
exchange
for
its
own
stock
and
then
liquidating
the
corporation
statute
was
held
not
to
prevent
the
corporation
from
suing
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
corporation
transaction
presumably
would
have
qualified
under
section
as
a
contractual
reorganization
followed
by
a
section
liquidation
but
not
under
section
as
a
statutory
merger
of
consolidation
nevertheless
relied
on
the
case
and
also
mentioned
that
the
shareholders
of
the
two
corporations
were
the
same
substance
said
the
there
was
no
transfer
of
equitable
title
arrives
at
substantially
the
same
conclusion
but
skirts
the
problem
of
section
of
the
provides
that
if
the
corporation
against
which
a
tax
was
assessed
has
since
been
liquidated
by
merger
with
a
successor
corporation
a
claim
for
refund
should
be
filed
by
the
successor
in
the
name
and
on
behalf
of
the
corporation
which
paid
the
tax
followed
by
the
name
of
the
successor
corporation
evidence
of
the
liquidation
and
succession
must
also
be
filed
the
succession
is
a
matter
of
public
record
certificates
of
the
of
or
other
public
officials
having
custody
of
the
documents
will
suffice
if
the
succession
is
not
of
record
all
documents
relating
to
such
succession
properly
certified
are
required
former
proof
seems
applicable
to
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
the
latter
to
a
contractual
acquisition
would
not
however
apply
to
an
acquisition
of
assets
for
cash
recent
although
rather
confusing
cites
and
follows
suggests
also
that
it
applies
to
either
a
statutory
or
contractual
reorganization
a
successor
corporation
in
a
reorganization
appears
entitled
to
sue
for
a
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
merged
corporation
despite
section
a
reorganization
followed
by
a
section
liquidation
those
cases
which
hold
that
section
is
inapplicable
to
transfers
in
liquidation
appear
to
permit
the
successor
corporation
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
the
transferor
fact
a
cash
purchase
of
a
stock
followed
by
liquidation
might
also
be
an
effective
way
to
transfer
a
claim
for
refund
if
the
doctrine
is
not
applied
to
eliminate
the
intermediate
step
results
appear
sound
stated
in
and
numerous
other
cases
the
two
primary
reasons
for
the
enactment
of
section
of
the
were
to
prevent
the
from
having
to
deal
with
more
than
one
claimant
and
to
prevent
the
assignment
of
meretricious
claims
on
a
basis
cases
have
allowed
transfer
of
claims
if
beneficial
ownership
is
not
changed
first
reason
would
never
apply
to
a
reorganization
transfer
which
meets
the
conditions
of
section
which
is
the
only
type
presently
under
discussion
applies
only
to
a
transfer
by
liquidation
of
a
subsidiary
owned
to
the
extent
of
at
least
per
cent
a
statutory
merger
or
consolidation
an
acquisition
of
substantially
all
a
assets
solely
in
exchange
for
voting
stock
or
a
change
of
identity
form
or
place
of
organization
virtually
every
case
the
transferor
corporation
is
liquidated
and
its
former
stockholders
either
own
outright
or
have
a
continuing
stock
interest
in
the
assets
which
gave
rise
to
the
tax
these
circumstances
the
possibility
of
multiple
or
conflicting
claims
is
exceedingly
remote
in
a
reorganization
the
continuing
interest
of
stockholders
of
the
corporation
which
paid
the
tax
must
be
greater
than
is
necessary
in
a
statutory
merger
to
which
the
statute
is
clearly
inapplicable
is
it
at
all
likely
that
a
desperate
claim
against
the
will
be
assigned
on
a
basis
in
the
guise
of
a
reorganization
the
transferor
has
substantial
assets
other
than
the
claim
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
no
corporation
would
be
willing
to
acquire
all
of
its
properties
in
the
dim
hope
of
collecting
a
claim
for
refund
of
taxes
such
an
unlikely
transaction
were
to
take
place
it
would
more
logically
be
accomplished
by
a
stock
purchase
followed
by
the
prosecution
of
the
claim
by
the
subsidiary
followed
by
liquidation
the
rare
case
where
a
only
substantial
asset
or
its
most
important
one
is
a
claim
for
refund
perhaps
its
transfer
should
not
be
permitted
whether
the
reorganization
takes
the
form
of
a
statutory
merger
or
of
the
acquisition
of
assets
for
stock
appears
then
that
although
the
matter
is
not
dealt
with
in
section
a
successor
corporation
in
a
reorganization
of
a
type
specified
in
section
is
entitled
to
sue
for
refund
of
taxes
paid
by
a
transferor
corporation
of

been
interpreted
as
not
applying
to
claims
against
the

reorganizations
successor
corporations
have
been
held
entitled
to
sue
on
such
claims
tax
attributes
of
the
transferor
are
certain
tax
attributes
of
a
corporation
whose
nature
and
effect
might
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
reorganization
involved
example
property
used
in
the
trade
or
business
of
a
transferor
corporation
as
defined
in
section
presumably
would
not
retain
its
special
status
following
a
reorganization
if
it
is
not
so
used
in
the
business
of
the
acquiring
corporation
parent
of
a
group
filing
consolidated
returns
might
be
treated
as
the
same
corporation
following
a
reorganization
defined
in
section
but
as
a
different
corporation
for
this
purpose
after
a
acquisition
by
another
corporation
which
had
not
for
example
elected
to
file
consolidated
returns
with
its
own
subsidiaries
considerations
presumably
made
it
difficult
to
prescribe
a
general
rule
where
the
acquired
and
acquiring
corporations
have
different
methods
of
accounting
section
or
depreciation
section
sections
of
the
provide
for
survival
of
certain
of
a
tax
attributes
following
a
reorganization
requires
carryover
of
the
transferor
basis
for
property
transferred
and
section
provides
for
tacking
on
the
holding
period
for
such
property
to
that
of
the
transferee
permits
a
person
acquiring
facilities
to
elect
to
continue
amortization
over
a
period
a
similar
privilege
was
not
specifically
provided
in
section
for
a
person
acquiring
emergency
facilities
similar
to
a
loss
carryover
may
be
certain
items
which
are
quite
similar
to
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
or
operating
deficit
and
whose
right
to
survive
a
reorganization
should
perhaps
be
subject
to
the
conditions
applicable
to
those
items
example
suppose
another
excess
profits
tax
similar
to
prior
laws
is
enacted
providing
for
carryover
of
excess
profits
credits
carryover
right
has
a
number
of
things
in
common
with
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
is
an
averaging
device
intended
to
ease
the
tax
burden
of
fluctuating
income
it
is
a
tax
benefit
which
might
be
of
substantial
value
to
a
corporation
which
expects
to
have
a
high
excess
profits
tax
the
this
item
was
permitted
to
survive
a
reorganization
in
the
case
but
only
over
the
dissent
of
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
in
the
case
a
leading
case
requiring
carryover
of
earnings
and
profits
in
a
reorganization
this
type
of
item
was
not
in
the
statute
when
section
was
enacted
in
one
cannot
say
with
certainty
what
effect
the
enactment
of
that
section
should
have
respect
to
this
type
of
item
one
might
properly
apply
the
language
of
the
quoted
above
which
cautions
against
using
section
as
a
basis
for
treating
other
tax
attributes
not
mentioned
therein
there
do
not
presently
appear
to
be
items
in
the
statute
comparable
to
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
the
primary
reason
for
special
treatment
of
a
net
operating
loss
carryover
is
the
unique
opportunity
it
presents
for
tax
avoidance
for
selecting
mail
questionnaire
method
were
two
methods
that
could
have
been
used
for
conducting
the
study
within
the
resources
available
interviews
in
depth
with
a
few
selected
companies
and
the
more
limited
interrogation
of
a
large
number
of
companies
by
means
of
a
mail
questionnaire
the
method
of
interviewing
a
small
number
of
companies
was
appealing
because
of
the
opportunity
it
might
have
furnished
to
probe
fully
the
reasons
and
circumstances
of
a
practices
and
opinions
it
also
involved
the
risk
of
paying
undue
attention
to
the
unique
and
peculiar
problems
of
just
a
few
individual
companies
a
result
it
was
decided
that
a
mail
questionnaire
sent
to
a
large
number
of
companies
would
be
more
effective
in
determining
the
general
practices
and
opinions
of
small
firms
and
in
highlighting
some
of
the
fundamental
and
recurring
problems
of
defense
procurement
that
concern
both
industry
and
government
was
also
hoped
that
responses
to
a
mail
questionnaire
would
suggest
fruitful
inquiries
that
might
be
made
in
subsequent
studies
of
a
more
detailed
nature
is
recognized
that
a
mail
questionnaire
has
inherent
limitations
is
the
danger
that
the
questions
will
mean
different
things
to
different
respondents
yes
or
no
answers
do
not
reveal
the
different
shades
of
opinion
that
the
various
respondents
may
have
respondent
may
want
to
make
alternative
answers
because
he
does
not
know
the
precise
circumstances
assumed
in
the
question
is
also
the
problem
of
the
frame
of
reference
the
respondent
making
a
recommendation
for
his
own
benefit
for
the
benefit
of
his
industry
for
the
benefit
of
a
specific
government
department
or
service
for
the
benefit
of
the
defense
program
for
the
benefit
of
small
business
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayers
is
also
the
question
of
whether
the
respondent
based
his
answers
on
factual
information
and
carefully
considered
judgment
or
whether
his
answers
were
casual
guesses
there
is
the
question
of
how
strongly
an
expressed
opinion
is
held
whether
it
is
a
firm
opinion
or
one
that
the
respondent
favors
only
slightly
over
the
alternatives
research
team
was
very
mindful
of
these
dangers
and
limitations
of
a
mail
questionnaire
the
circumstances
however
the
team
considered
it
would
provide
the
most
useful
information
at
this
point
the
preparation
of
the
questionnaire
the
problems
noted
above
were
carefully
considered
and
the
structure
and
phraseology
used
were
designed
to
minimize
the
effects
of
these
limitations
of
the
questionnaire
questionnaire
was
designed
to
elicit
three
types
of
information
the
facts
regarding
certain
characteristics
of
the
respondents
including
their
experience
with
and
interest
in
securing
defense
business
the
actual
selling
and
buying
practices
of
the
respondents
and
the
attitudes
and
opinions
of
the
respondents
concerning
bidding
procedures
and
the
methods
of
awarding
defense
contracts
was
hoped
that
the
facts
concerning
the
characteristics
and
practices
of
the
respondents
would
offer
clues
to
the
reasons
why
they
took
the
positions
and
made
the
recommendations
which
they
did

note
that

research
team
prepared

then
revised
the

over
a
period
of
six
months
an
early
draft
of
the

along
with
a

mailed
to
fourteen

of
days
after

contacted
the

of
eleven
of
these

in

to
discuss
any
ambiguities

difficulties
the
addressees
might
have
experienced
in
completing

test
resulted
in
further
revisions
of
the

research
team
was
concerned
that

first

of
fourteen
manufacturing

located

to

primary
consideration
in

was
convenience

materially
different

those
of

have
resulted
from

identified
by
a
serial

by
the
geographical
location

responses
except

were
numerically
coded
to

involved
key
punching

able
to
properly
relate
the

number
of
the

cards
were
then
processed
using
standard
punch
card
equipment
including
an
computer
first
step
in
processing
was
to
analyze
the
returns
from

to
determine
whether
the

were
large

set
aside
and
not
used
because
they
were
not
relevant
to
a
study
of
the
opinions
and

of

second
step
in
processing
was
to
compare
the
responses
from
companies
on
the
list
with
those
from
companies
on
the
list
in
order
to
determine
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
merge
the
responses

the
purposes
of
the

methods
and
results
of
this
comparative
analysis
are

in
was
concluded
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
process
the
two
groups
of

as
a

sample
of
all
small

wishing
to
sell
to

the
first
place
the
two
groups
of
firms
when
combined
had
characteristics
and

that
were

representative
of

alone
vast

one
of
the
most
productive
agricultural
areas
in
the

the
summer
of

became
the
setting
for
a
bitter
and
basic
struggle
contestants
in
this
economic
struggle

program
we
necessarily
found
ourselves
in
the
middle
between
these
two
forces
is
not
a
pleasant
or
easy
position
but
one
we
have
endeavored
to
maintain
have
sought
to
be
strictly
neutral
as
between
the
parties
but
at
the
same
time
we
have
been
required
frequently
to
rule
on
specific
issues
or
situations
as
they
arose
one
side
was
pleased

the
other
displeased
regardless
of
how
we
ruled
the
displeased
parties
interpreted
our
decision
as
implying
favoritism
toward
the

consoled
ourselves
with
the
thought
that
this
is
a
normal
human
reaction
and
is
one
of
the
consequences
of
any
decision
in
an
adversary
proceeding
is
disconcerting
nevertheless
to
read
in
a
labor
weekly
knuckles
down
to
growers
and
then
to
be
confronted
with
a
publication
which
states
recognizes
obviously
phony
and
strikes
as
bona

a
number
of
years
there
have
been
sporadic
attempts
in
to
organize
farm
workers
attempts
met
with
little
sucess
for
a
variety
of
reasons
were
inadequately
financed
without
experienced
leadership
and
lacked
the
general
support
of
organized

as
a
whole
past

the
pattern
has
been

we

obligations

pertinent
regulation
for

in

person

be
referred
to
a
position
the
filling
of
which
will

in

provided

written
notice
of
such

prior
to
or
at
the
time
of
his
referral
analyzing
this
regulation
let
us
take
the
last
sentence
first
permits
referrals
under
certain
circumstances
even
when
there
is
a
labor
dispute
provided
the
individual
is
given
written
notice
of
such
a
dispute
for
example
a
situation
where
a
farm
has
a
packing
shed
and
fields
packing
shed
workers
go
on
strike
is
no
dispute
involving
fieldwork
concluded
that
we
may
refer
workers
to
the
fieldwork
but
not
the
packing
shed
work
provided
we
give
them
written
notice
of
the
packing
shed
dispute
far
no
troublesome
cases
have
arisen
under
this
provision
is
the
first
part
of
the
that
is
currently
at
issue
that
it
prohibits
referrals
under
either
condition
or
condition
representatives
have
contended
that
the
has
gone
beyond
his
authority
by
such
a
prohibition
on
the
grounds
that
the
requires
only
written
notice
to
the
prospective
worker
that
a
dispute
exists
court
matter
got
into
the
courts
this
way
of
the
early
strikes
called
by
the
was
at
the
pear
orchards
in
found
that
a
labor
dispute
existed
and
that
the
workers
had
left
their
jobs
which
were
then
vacant
because
of
the
dispute
under
clause
of
the
we
suspended
referrals
to
the
employer
no
nationals
were
involved
employer
seeking
to
continue
his
harvest
challenged
our
right
to
cease
referrals
to
him
and
sought
relief
in
the
of
court
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
directing
us
to
resume
referrals
of
course
obeyed
the
court
order
the
of
at
the
request
of
the
of
sought
to
have
the
jurisdiction
over
the
issue
removed
to
the
on
grounds
that
it
was
predominantly
a
issue
since
the
validity
of
the
was
being
challenged
the
held
that
since
the
had
accepted
the
provisions
of
the
into
its
own
and
presumably
therefore
also
the
regulations
it
was
now
a
matter
accordingly
refused
to
assume
jurisdiction
whereupon
the
made
the
restraining
order
permanent
that
order
we
have
continued
referring
workers
to
the
ranch
similar
case
arose
at
the
ranch
in
and
the
of
that
county
issued
similar
restraining
orders
growers
have
strenuously
argued
that
should
have
accepted
the
decisions
as
conclusive
and
issued
statewide
instructions
to
our
staff
to
ignore
this
provision
in
the
cannot
accept
that
view
either
as
a
lawyer
or
as
an
administrator
considerations
let
us
examine
briefly
some
of
the
legal
considerations
involved
is
an
accepted
juridical
principle
in
that
a
decision
does
not
constitute
a
binding
legal
precedent
is
conclusive
unless
appealed
only
upon
the
particular
parties
to
the
particular
action
which
was
heard
is
not
binding
upon
another
which
could
rule
to
the
contrary
when
a
decision
is
rendered
by
the
of
or
of
course
the
is
a
binding
precedent
established
that
event
we
can
correctly
say
that
we
have
received
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
the
matter
and
one
which
we
can
follow
statewide
with
confidence
that
the
policy
will
not
be
overthrown
in
other
over
and
beyond
the
compelling
need
for
a
binding
precedent
decision
am
convinced
that
the
decisions
of
the
which
in
effect
nullify
the
are
not
a
correct
interpretation
of
the
power
under
the
law
believe
am
in
good
company
in
this
view
of
concurs
in
this
interpretation
and
has
filed
an
appeal
from
these
decisions
to
the
of
of
the
in
considering
the
power
of
the
to
issue
similar
regulations
under
the
relating
to
the
interstate
recruitment
of
farm
workers
has
rendered
an
opinion
sustaining
his
authority

as
an
evidence
of
legislative
intent
only
the
of
the
recently
defeated
by
a
substantial
majority
the
to
the
which
would
have
specifically
limited
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
in
these
matters
let
us
consider
briefly
the
program
and
administrative
implications
of
a
failure
on
our
part
to
pursue
our
appeals
is
far
too
much
at
stake
for
all
of
the
parties
concerned
to
leave
the
matter
hanging
in
midair
ramifications
of
the
issue
are
enormous
decision
to
refer
workers
to
jobs
vacant
because
of
a
strike
would
have
to
be
applied
equally
to
nonagricultural
situations
and
might
in
effect
place
the
public
employment
services
in
the
position
of
acting
as
strikebreakers
public
interest
is
so
dominant
in
such
an
issue
that
cannot
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
attempt
to
settle
it
by
an
administrative
order
based
upon
conclusions
reached
in
a
summary
action
in
one
or
two
in
the
is
an
issue
which
may
well
reach
the
of
the
before
judicial
finality
is
achieved
an
administrator
cannot
place
the
in
in
jeopardy
of
being
out
of
compliance
with
the
laws
by
my
failure
to
pursue
the
avenues
of
appeal
open
to
me
have
applied
statewide
the
decisions
of
the
two
cases
heard
in
in
my
opinion
would
have
placed
us
clearly
out
of
compliance
with
the
and
would
have
immediately
opened
the
way
for
the
of

he
so
inclined
to
notify
the
of
such
noncompliance
set
a
date
for
hearing
and
issue
his
finding
impact
of
noncompliance
under
the
is
clear
the
withdrawal
of
some
million
a
year
of
administrative
funds
which
finance
our
employment
service
program
or
as
a
corollary
the
taking
over
by
the
of
its
operation
far
the
cases
which
have
come
before
the
courts
have
involved
only
the
issue
of
referral
where
the
job
is
vacant
due
to
a
strike
condition
in
the
of
the
has
yet
arisen
under
condition
relating
to
referral
to
jobs
the
filling
of
which
is
an
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
the
problem
is
essentially
one
of
defining
the
word
filling
it
be
defined
in
a
narrow
sense
to
include
only
such
elements
as
job
specifications
union
membership
union
jurisdiction
and
the
like
should
it
have
a
broader
connotation
of
including
wage
demands
and
other
factors
not
necessarily
associated
with
the
mechanics
of
filling
the
job
of
the
uncertainty
of
this
definition
solicited
the
interpretation
of
the
of
has
advised
me
that
the
narrower
interpretation
is
the
proper
one
that
is
that
if
wages
for
example
is
the
only
issue
in
a
labor
dispute
and
no
workers
have
left
their
jobs
because
of
the
dispute
we
may
continue
to
make
referrals
and
present
evidence
that
infants
and
young
children
can
and
do
solve
many
problems
at
a
relatively
simple
perceptual
level
simply
by
combining
objects
and
counting
them
they
have
developed
concepts
they
are
free
from
the
necessity
of
manipulating
objects
they
do
symbolically
what
they
once
had
to
do
concretely
ability
to
think
seems
to
increase
consistently
with
age
experiment
showed
the
greatest
difference
occurring
between
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
years
studies
indicate
that
interests
cover
the
whole
field
of
science
that
their
questions
indicate
a
genuine
interest
in
social
processes
and
events
and
that
as
they
mature
their
interests
and
capabilities
change
and
broaden
characteristics
a
child
feels
about
himself
about
other
people
and
about
the
tasks
confronting
him
in
school
may
have
as
much
influence
on
his
success
in
school
as
his
physical
and
intellectual
characteristics
considerable
amount
of
evidence
exists
to
show
that
an
unhappy
and
insecure
child
is
not
likely
to
do
well
in
school
subjects
maturity
is
the
result
of
many
factors
the
principal
ones
being
the
experiences
of
the
first
few
years
of
the
life
the
teacher
who
understands
the
influence
of
emotions
on
behavior
may
be
highly
influential
in
helping
pupils
gain
confidence
security
and
satisfaction
this
responsibility
of
the
teacher
suggestions
for
helping
children
gain
better
control
of
the
emotions
are
presented
in
following
generalizations
about
the
emotional
characteristics
of
children
may
be
helpful
the
young
emotional
reactions
last
for
a
relatively
short
time
as
contrasted
to
those
of
an
adult
the
child
grows
older
his
emotional
reactions
lead
to
moods
or
emotional
states
drawn
out
over
a
period
of
time
and
expressed
slowly
rather
than
in
short
abrupt
outbursts
of
the
growth
and
decline
of
fears
indicate
that
fears
due
to
strange
objects
noises
falling
and
unexpected
movement
decline
during
the
preschool
years
but
that
fears
of
the
dark
of
being
alone
and
of
imaginary
creatures
or
robbers
increase
a
child
for
being
afraid
or
forcing
him
to
meet
the
feared
situation
alone
are
poor
ways
of
dealing
with
the
problem
more
effective
solutions
include
explanations
the
example
of
another
child
or
conditioning
by
associating
the
feared
object
place
or
person
with
something
pleasant
need
help
in
learning
to
control
their
emotions
young
child
learns
from
parents
and
teachers
that
temper
tantrums
screaming
kicking
and
hitting
will
not
get
him
what
he
wants
the
older
child
learns
that
intense
emotional
outbursts
will
not
win
approval
by
his
peers
and
therefore
makes
a
real
effort
to
control
his
emotions
differ
widely
in
their
emotional
responses
infants
the
patterns
of
emotional
responses
are
similar
as
the
influence
of
learning
and
environment
are
felt
emotional
behavior
becomes
individualized
characteristics
no
national
norms
exist
for
the
social
development
of
children
the
teacher
can
find
a
great
deal
of
information
concerning
types
of
social
behavior
normally
displayed
by
children
at
various
age
levels
following
summary
will
give
the
student
some
idea
about
the
social
characteristics
of
children
the
student
will
certainly
want
to
explore
more
deeply
into
the
fascinating
study
of
immature
individuals
struggling
to
meet
their
developmental
needs
and
at
the
same
time
trying
to
learn
the
rules
of
the
game
in
the
number
of
groups
in
which
they
hold
membership
early
childhood
children
are
more
interested
in
the
approval
of
their
parents
and
teachers
than
they
are
in
the
approval
of
other
children
after
they
have
been
in
school
a
few
years
their
interest
in
playmates
of
their
own
age
increases
and
their
interest
in
adults
decreases
the
child
who
had
once
considered
it
a
treat
to
accompany
his
parents
on
picnics
and
family
gatherings
now
considers
it
a
bore
late
childhood
the
influence
of
the
group
on
the
social
behavior
of
the
child
continues
to
increase
the

the
kind
of

engaged
in

the
ideals
of
right
and
wrong

choice
of
a

is
likely
to
be
for
another

his

can
do
the
things
he
likes

his

an
interest
in

play
loyalty
to

a
feeling
of
superiority
over
those
who

unwillingness
to
play
with
members
of
the
opposite

become
dominant
traits
early

the
average
more
than

those
who
feel
inferior

insecure
engage
in
these
activities
more
than
do

boys
like
to
tease

girls
who
are
more
mature
than

frown
upon
the
youthful
antics
of
boys
of
their

time
pupils
reach
the
sixth
grade
their
ethical
and
moral
standards
are
fairly
well
developed
they
exhibit
a
keen
interest
in
social
political
and
economic
problems
but
they
frequently
have
vague
and
incorrect
notions
about
the
terms
they
use
rather
glibly

work
the
ages

negativism

resistance
to
adult
authority
is
noticeable
after
the
fourth
year
it
begins
to
decline
as
we
have
seen
in

the

to
substitute
the

child
in
the
primary
grades
can
play
harmoniously
with
one
companion
but
his
desire
to
be
first
in
everything
gets
him
into
trouble
when
the
group
gets
larger
he
wants
to
be
with
people
but
he
yet
learned
to
cooperate
the
middle
grades
however
he
begins
to
participate
more
effectively
in
group
activities
such
as
selecting
a
leader
helping
to
make
plans
and
carry
on
group
activities
and
setting
up
rules
governing
the
enterprise
the
teacher
should
study
the
individual
pupil
progress
has
been
made
in
the
last
two
decades
in
developing
techniques
for
understanding
children
yet
in
almost
any
classroom
today
can
be
found
children
whose
needs
are
not
being
met
by
the
school
program
are
failing
to
achieve
as
much
as
their
ability
would
permit
others
never
seem
able
to
enter
fully
into
the
life
of
the
classroom
children
have
been
described
as
those
who
were
trying
to
say
something
to
adults
who
did
not
understand
school
systems
now
employ
school
psychologists
and
child
guidance
specialists
specialists
perform
valuable
services
by
helping
teachers
learn
to
identify
children
who
need
special
attention
by
suggesting
ways
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individual
children
in
the
regular
classroom

services
for
severely
maladjusted
children

the

teacher
however
who
has
daily
contacts
with
pupils
and
who
is
in
a
unique
position
to
put
sound
psychological
principles
into
practice
a
study
of
the
individual
child
is
an
integral
part
of
the
work
of
the
teacher
rather
than
merely
an
additional
chore
and
administrators
in
many
elementary
schools
have
assumed
that
dividing
the
pupils
in
any
grade
into
groups
on
the
basis
of
test
scores
solves
the
problem
of
meeting
the
needs
of
individuals
they
should
recognize
is
that
children
who
have
been
placed
in
one
of
these
groups
on
a
narrow
academic
basis
still
differ
widely
in
attributes
that
influence
success
and
that
they
still
must
be
treated
as
individuals

that

that
the

makes
it

that

desegregation
continues
including
the
in

its

record
is
clear
that
increase
in
school
desegregation
last

came
largely
as
a
result
of
a
court
order
that
on
the
immediate
horizon
if

relatively
speaking
desegregation
comes
it
will
result
from
court
orders
on

that
thousands
of

and
observation
that
school
desegregation
has
occurred
in

a
handful
in

to
a
conclusion
that
is
slow
turning
to
my
views
as
to
the
problems
and
issues
before
us
at
this
wish
to
note
a
small
item
in
the
as
it
refers
to
the
of
reference
in
the
is
continuation
of
the
trend
toward
an
school
system
a
remark
apparently
occasioned
by
the
increase
of
school
population
from
per
cent
to
per
cent
see
no
real
prospects
for
an
school
population
of
is
still
monolithically
white
and
is
in
fact
increasingly
white
as
a
result
of
housing
program
is
ousting
large
acreage
in
the
area
beckons
white
people
what
with
town
houses
and
elevator
apartments
rehabilitation
like
replaces
with
whites
but
also
replaces
some
whites
with
other
whites
sharpest
break
with
tradition
the
past
and
present
of
a
may
come
with
the
opening
of
nearby
suburbs
to
residents
and
presumably
the
consequent
conclusion
of
some
whites
that
they
cannot
escape
the
by
fleeing
to
the
suburbs
fact
short
of
fleeing
to
or
white
people
may
have
to
live
with
of
this
must
be
taken
into
account
before
the
image
of
an
public
school
system
is
conjured
up
to
solve
the
before
us
at
this
a
number
of
problems
are
apparent
vex
us
and
perplex
us
but
generally
do
not
divide
us
like
the
issues
which
follow
the
problems
how
can
we
step
up
the
desegregation
movement
is
slow
believe
we
all
want
more
schools
where
white
and
together
can
and
do
attend
believe
we
all
want
no
child
denied
admission
to
a
school
on
account
of
his
color
general
members
of
would
certainly
want
a
child
admitted
to
a
school
nearest
his
residence
or
within
his
residence
zone
to
achieve
this
objective
is
a
problem
but
we
are
not
divided
on
what
we
want
as
we
increase
the
number
of
desegregated
school
districts
and
schools
themselves
how
can
we
achieve
this
action
through
school
board
action
may
be
county
school
board
or
state
school
board
action
as
well
as
that
of
municipal
school
boards
can
we
reduce
the
role
of
the
district
courts
so
that
the
action
is
that
of
the
people
of
the
community
or
other
school
district
and
not
that
of
the
law
court
is
a
problem
and
believe
there
is
little
difference
of
opinion
that
wherever
possible
a
local
school
board
should
devise
and
effect
a
plan
of
desegregation
how
can
we
insure
a
systematic
and
continuing
group
relations
education
in
the
schools
simply
a
brief
program
when
the
schools
are
actually
desegregated
but
a
continuing
program
that
also
promotes
integration
that
encourages
the
children
and
teachers
not
to
look
at
each
other
as
white
or
but
as
human
beings
the
problem
is
how
to
get
it
done
and
in
what
form
to
offer
the
group
relations
education
not
whether
it
should
be
done
in
the
segregated
school
system
during
the
period
before
desegregation
how
can
we
assure
equal
opportunity
fact
in
the
desegregated
school
system
which
may
have
a
good
many
schools
with
population
how
can
we
assure
equal
opportunity
is
a
problem
but
we
are
not
divided
over
its
importance
or
by
its
existence
in
the
segregated
school
system
or
in
the
or
schools
how
can
we
encourage
better
group
relations
or
an
improved
attitude
toward
people
who
do
not
belong
to
the
group
we
help
children
adjust
to
images
of
other
children
when
the
latter
are
not
actually
present
the
issues
we
have
five
problems
whose
solution
we
seek
in
relatively
united
fashion
then
there
are
twice
as
many
issues
which
judge
sharply
divide
us
intergroup
relations

and
lay
people
assignment
on
the
one
hand
school
desegregation
has
come
in
with
pupil
assignment
shall
we
support
the
plan
the
basis
of
pupil
assignment
criteria
has
assigned
children
to
formerly
white
schools
in
and
we
support
pupil
assignment
the
other
hand
looking
at
the
larger
picture
is
it
true
that
pupil
assignment
has
effectively
cut
off
blocked
or
reduced
school
desegregation
to
a
trickle
we
therefore
oppose
the
plan
question
is
an
issue
because
it
likely
divides
us
into
two
camps
those
for
or
against
pupil
assignment
assignment
in
order
to
desegregate
large
cities
like
and
should
school
desegregation
be
extended
to
and
schools
by
assigning
white
and
teachers
respectively
the
one
hand
do
we
argue
the
decision
required
only
that
a
child
not
be
denied
admission
to
a
school
on
account
of
his
race
should
we
argue
that
if
we
want
adjustment
of
children
to
children
of
different
races
and
that
that
is
impossible
in
an
school
we
must
at
least
provide
him
some
opportunity
to
adjust
to
people
of
another
race
within
the
school
namely
to
a
teacher
of
another
race
can
argue
that
where
residence
makes
pupil
desegregation
impossible
teacher
assignment
can
create
a
partially
desegregated
situation
plaintiff
in
school
desegregation
cases
earlier
part
of
my
statement
deals
with
the
court
orders
that
resulted
in
desegregation
each
instance
the
plaintiff
was
a
private
citizen
thousands
of
school
districts
indeed
in
the
entire
of
no
plaintiff
has
come
forth
have
established
that
the
action
of
municipal
county
or
state
school
boards
or
boards
of
education
is
small
infinitesimally
small
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
districts
the
requirement
that
the
plaintiff
be
a
person
actually
denied
admission
to
a
school
a
sound
requirement
authorize
the
to
file
suit
to
accomplish
admission
of
a
child
to
a
school
to
which
he
is
denied
entrance
though
in
civil
rights
legislation
in
and
the
provision
for
the
to
act
was
eliminated
should
we
nevertheless
support
such
a
clause
is
an
issue
for
it
divides
people
rather
sharply
of
funds
to
schools
that
deny
children
on
account
of
race
is
the
which
in
divided
even
a
liberal
group
like
the
we
support
a
clause
in
school
construction
or
school
assistance
legislation
that
would
deny
funds
to
a
school
district
that
denies
admission
to
a
child
on
account
of
his
race
is
softer
than
earlier
amendments
which
would
have
denied
funds
to
all
segregated
school
districts
is
nonetheless
considerable
argument
against
the
clause
softened
though
it
be
on
the
grounds
that
aid
is
so
necessary
to
the
public
schools
funds
limitation
enlists
the
support
of
many
the
opposition
of
quite
a
few

the
of
voted
not
to
provide

for
public

and
the
school
board
therefore
could
provide
no
public
education
for
white
or
children
public
education
in
this
democracy
of
such
importance
that
no
child
should
be
denied
public
education
is
this
subject
a
matter
of
a
matter
of
states
rights
or
county
rights
people
want
to
provide
public
education
should
they
be
forced
to
do
so
if
we
marshal
substantial
agreement
behind
mandatory
public
education
we
likely
cannot
expect
that
all
the
states
will
enact
the
legislation
the
requirement
which
must
therefore
be
in
nature
be
legislated
by
the
must
it
become
law
by
amendment
of
the
actually
have
two
issues
in
this
question
goal
and
method
responsibility
for
education
of
the
citizens
the
above
issue
is
settled
by
requiring
public
education
for
all
citizens
may
be
moot
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
settled
or
while
it
is
being
debated
and
resolved
does
the
government
have
a
responsibility
in
situations
like
that
in
half
the
children
still
receive
no
education
or
should
the
government
help
the
government
directly
provide
education
for
the
children
who
want
public
education
next
question
is
whether
board
members
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
their
roles
as
educational
the
whole
it
appears
that
they
do
not
favor
their
own
social
classes
in
an
explicit
way
is
there
an
issue
in
which
class
lines
can
be
clearly
drawn
hypothetical
issue
of
this
sort
might
deal
with
the
establishment
of
a
free
public
junior
college
in
a
community
where
there
already
was
a
good
private
college
which
served
the
youth
adequately
but
was
too
expensive
for
youth
situations
of
this
sort
the
board
generally
favors
the
expansion
of
free
education
studied
the
records
of
school
board
members
in
twelve
western
cities
over
the
period
of
and
found
little
or
no
relationship
between
certain
social
and
economic
factors
and
school
board
competence
as
judged
by
a
panel
of
professional
educators
who
studied
the
voting
records
on
educational
issues
few
cases
of
clear
favoritism
along
lines
are
as
likely
as
not
to
involve
representatives
of
the
working
class
on
the
school
board
who
favor
some
such
practice
as
higher
wages
for
janitors
rather
than
pay
increases
for
teachers
and
such
issues
are
not
issues
of
educational
policy
general
it
appears
that
trustees
and
board
members
attempt
to
represent
the
public
interest
in
their
administration
of
educational
policy
and
this
is
made
easier
by
the
fact
that
the
dominant
values
of
the
society
are
values
which
are
generally
thought
to
be
valid
for
the
entire
society
have
been
very
few
cases
of
explicit
conflict
of
interest
between
the
middle
class
and
any
other
class
in
the
field
of
educational
policy
there
were
more
such
cases
it
would
be
easier
to
answer
the
question
whether
the
favor
their
own
social
classes
is
currently
a
major
controversy
of
public
education
in
which
group
interests
and
values
are
heavily
engaged
is
the
issue
of
segregated
schools
in
the
this
case
it
is
primarily
a
matter
of
conflict
of
racial
groups
rather
than
groups
the
white
middle
and
lower
classes
are
arrayed
against
the
middle
and
lower
classes
conflict
may
be
resolved
in
a
way
which
will
suit
white
people
better
than
it
suits
white
people
this
happens
there
may
be
some
class
conflict
in
the
with
school
boards
and
school
teachers
taking
the
position
educational
profession
members
of
the
educational
profession
have
a
major
voice
in
the
determination
of
educational
policy
their
position
being
strongest
in
the
universities
are
mostly
and
people
with
a
few
in
the
upper
class
they
make
decisions
a
society
dominated
by
values
and
working
in
an
institution
which
transmits
and
strengthens
these
social
values
it
is
clear
that
the
educational
profession
must
work
for
the
values
which
are
characteristic
of
the
society
is
no
problem
here
problem
arises
if
it
does
arise
when
the
educator
has
to
make
a
choice
or
a
decision
within
the
area
of
his
professional
competence
but
which
bears
some
relation
to
the
social
structure
instance
in
giving
school
grades
or
in
making
recommendations
for
the
award
of
a
college
scholarship
does
he
consciously
or
unconsciously
favor
students
of
one
or
another
social
class
in
deciding
on
the
content
and
method
of
his
teaching
does
he
favor
a
curriculum
which
will
make
his
students
stronger
competitors
in
the
race
for
higher
economic
status
or
does
he
favor
a
curriculum
which
strengthens
students
in
other
ways
answers
to
questions
such
as
these
certainly
depend
to
some
extent
upon
the
own
position
and
also
upon
his
social
history
as
well
as
upon
his
personality
and
what
he
conceives
his
mission
to
be
as
an
educator
a
set
of
case
studies
of
teachers
with
various
backgrounds
illustrates
a
variety
of
approaches
to
students
and
to
teaching
which
depend
upon
the
personality
as
well
as
on
his
background
teacher
may
be
a
hard
taskmaster
for
pupils
because
she
wants
them
to
develop
the
attitudes
and
skills
that
will
enable
them
to
climb
while
another
teacher
may
be
a
very
permissive
person
with
pupils
because
he
knows
their
disadvantages
and
deprivations
at
home
and
he
hopes
to
encourage
them
by
friendly
treatment
factor
which
plays
a
large
part
in
educational
policy
today
is
the
fact
that
a
great
many
school
and
college
teachers
are
upward
mobile
from
urban
and
families
own
experience
in
the
social
system
influences
their
work
and
attitudes
as
teachers
this
influence
is
a
complex
matter
depending
upon
personality
factors
in
the
individual
as
well
as
upon
his
experience
there
probably
are
some
general
statements
about
background
and
educational
policy
that
can
be
made
with
a
fair
degree
of
truth
who
have
been
upward
mobile
probably
see
education
as
most
valuable
for
their
students
if
it
serves
students
as
it
has
served
them
that
is
they
are
likely
to
favor
a
kind
of
education
that
has
value
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
such
teachers
will
favor
vocational
education
as
contrasted
with
liberal
education
but
they
are
likely
to
favor
an
approach
to
liberal
education
which
has
a
maximal
value
as
against
a
kind
of
pure
liberal
education
that
is
not
designed
to
help
people
get
better
jobs
is
no
doubt
that
higher
education
since
has
moved
away
from
pure
liberal
education
toward
greater
emphasis
on
technology
and
specialization
are
several
causes
for
this
one
being
rapid
economic
development
with
increasing
numbers
of
of
positions
requiring
engineering
or
scientific
training
another
cause
may
lie
in
the
experience
of
so
many
new
postwar
faculty
members
with
their
own
use
of
education
as
a
means
of
social
advancement
with
the
college
and
university
faculty
members
of
the
period
from
to
the
new
postwar
faculty
members
consist
of
more
children
of
immigrants
and
more
children
of
urban
fathers
experience
is
quite
in
contrast
with
that
of
children
of
and
parents
who
are
more
likely
to
regard
education
as
good
for
its
own
sake
and
to
discount
the
vocational
emphases
in
the
curriculum
public
interest
groups
policies
are
formed
by
several
groups
who
are
officially
or
unofficially
appointed
to
act
in
the
public
interest
are
one
such
group
and
state
legislators
have
major
responsibility
for
educational
legislation
generally
vote
so
as
to
serve
their
own
constituency
and
if
the
constituency
should
be
solidly
middle

or
solidly
lower
class
they
might
be
expected
to
vote
and
work
for
or
for
interests
in
education
there
are
relatively
few
such
political
constituencies
and
as
has
been
pointed
out
there
is
seldom
a
distinction
between
the
educational
interests
of
one
social
class
and
those
of

is

of

of

there

people
are
practically
always
or
persons
who
attempt

in
what
they
regard
as
the

there
are
the

the

and
they
attempt
to

in
the
general
public
interest
as
they
see
it
general
it
appears
that
educational

and
educational
policies
are
made
by
people
who
intend
to
act
in
the
interests
of
the
society
as
a

and
undoubtedly
share
the

and
attitudes
of
those
classes
may
be
unaware
of
the
existence
of

and
consequently
fail
to
take
them
into
account
there
is
very
little
frank
and
conscious
espousal
of
the
interests
of
any
one
social
class
by
the
people
who
have
the
power
to
make
decisions
in
education
think
of
themselves
as
trustees
for
the
entire
society
and
try
to
serve
the
entire
society
to
influence
social
structure
through
education
policy
in
the
has
as
an
explicit
goal
the
maximization
of
economic
and
cultural
opportunity
so
far
as
this
goal
is
achieved
the
society
becomes
more
fluid
artificial
barriers
to
social
mobility
are
reduced
and
people
at
the
lower
end
of
the
social
hierarchy
share
more
fully
in
the
material
and
cultural
goods
of
society
the
other
hand
there
is
a
counterbalancing
purpose
in
education
which
is
to
pass
on
the
advantages
of
the
parents
to
their
children
leads
to
efforts
at
exclusiveness
through
private
schools
and
to
the
maintenance
of
social
stratification
in
the
schools
of
these
purposes
exist
side
by
side
without
much
overt
conflict
under
present
conditions
economic
and

broad
expansion
of
free
education
results
both
in
raising
the
average
economic
and
cultural
level
of
the
society
and
in
promoting
fluidity
within
the
social
structure
years
ago
the
general
raising
of
the
age
to
sixteen
was
an
example
of
this
movement
the
past
decade
the
program
has
been
carried
on
through
expansion
of
free
higher
education
in
state
universities
state
colleges
and
community
colleges
reaffirmation
of
faith
in
the
comprehensive
high
school
as
expressed
in
the
study
is
another
indication
of
the
liveliness
of
the
ideal
of
maximizing
opportunity
through
the
equalizing
of
educational
opportunity
recent
federal
program
is
another
step
in
the
direction
of
making
higher
education
more
available
to
youth
is
probably
more
effective
than
the
expanded
scholarship
programs
of
the
past
decade
because
the
scholarship
programs
mainly
aided
the
students
with
the
best
academic
records
who
were
usually
and
these
students
tended
to
use
the
scholarship
funds
to
go
to
more
expensive
colleges
the
private
colleges
have
increased
their
tuition
rates
so
much
that
they
have
raised
an
economic
barrier
which
dwarfs
their
scholarship
funds
gains
in
educational
opportunity
during
the
past
decade
have
taken
place
largely
in
the
publicly
supported
institutions
however
and
for
reasons
to
be
discussed
in
the
following
chapter
no
rate
relationships
can
be
made
completely
nondiscriminatory
as
long
as
all
or
some
of
the
rates
must
be
set
above
marginal
costs
in
order
to
yield
adequate
revenues
this
fact
may
explain
some
of
the
disagreements
among
the
experts
as
to
the
more
rational
formulas
for
the
apportionment
of
total
costs
among
different
units
of
service
such
disagreement
which
will
receive
attention
in
this
next
chapter
concerns
the
question
whether
rates
for
different
kinds
of
service
in
order
to
avoid
the
attribute
of
discrimination
must
be
made
directly
proportional
to
marginal
costs
or
whether
they
should
be
based
instead
on
differences
in
marginal
costs
the
choice
is
that
between
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
major
types
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis
type
an
ambiguity
due
to
its
failure
clearly
to
define
relative
costs
the
above
exposition
of
fully
distributed
costing
goes
about
as
far
as
one
can
go
toward
expressing
the
basic
philosophy
of
the
practice
more
explicit
expositions
one
must
distinguish
different
types
of
analyses
all
means
the
most
important
distinction
is
that
between
those
apportionments
which
superimpose
a
distribution
of
admittedly
unallocable
cost
residues
on
estimates
of
incremental
or
marginal
costs
and
those
other
apportionments
which
recognize
no
difference
between
true
cost
allocation
and
mere
distribution
first
or
type
might
also
be
called
the
railroad
type
because
of
its
application
to
railroads
and
other
transportation
agencies
by
the
of
the
distinguishes
between
directly
variable
costs
and
constant
costs
in
a
manner
noted
in
the
preceding
chapter
variable
costs
alone
are
assigned
to
the
different
units
of
freight
traffic
as
representing
costs
a
term
with
a
meaning
here
not
distinctly
different
from
that
of
the
marginal
costs
remains
a
residue
of
total
costs
or
total
revenue
requirements
which
since
it
is
found
to
behave
as
if
it
were
constant
over
substantial
variations
in
traffic
density
is
strictly
unallocable
on
a
basis
because
the
has
felt
impelled
to
make
some
kind
of
a
distribution
of
total
costs
it
has
apportioned
this
residue
which
it
sometimes
calls
burden
among
the
units
of
carload
traffic
on
a
basis
partly
ton
partly
which
is
concededly
quite
arbitrary
from
the
standpoint
of
cost
determination
recent
years
this
burden
which
includes
allowances
for
revenue
deficiencies
in
the
passenger
business
and
in
freight
traffic
has
amounted
to
about
one
third
of
those
total
revenue
requirements
which
the
carload
freight
business
is
supposed
to
be
called
upon
to
meet
this
book
is
concerned
only
incidentally
with
railroad
rates
it
will
not
attempt
to
analyze
the
methods
by
which
the
staff
of
the
has
estimated
costs
and
apportioned
residue
costs
it
to
say
that
the
usefulness
of
the
latter
apportionment
is
questionable
in
any
event
full
credit
should
be
given
to
the
for
its
express
and
overt
recognition
of
a
vital
distinction
too
often
ignored
in
analyses
namely
that
between
a
cost
allocation
designed
to
reflect
the
actual
behavior
of
costs
in
response
to
changes
in
rates
of
output
of
different
classes
of
utility
service
and
a
mere
cost
apportionment
which
somehow
spreads
among
the
classes
and
units
of
service
even
those
costs
that
are
strictly
unallocable
from
the
standpoint
of
specific
cost
determination
type
turn
now
to
a
type
of
fully
distributed
cost
analysis
which
unlike
the
railroad
type
draws
no
distinction
between
cost
allocation
and
cost
apportionment
the
type
might
be
called
the
public
utility
type
because
of
the
considerable
use
to
which
it
has
been
put
in
gas
and
electric
utility
rate
cases
no
attempt
is
made
first
to
determine
or
marginal
costs
and
then
to
superimpose
on
these
costs
reasonably
distributed
residues
of
total
costs
all
of
the
total
costs
are
treated
as
variable
costs
although
these
costs
are
divided
into
costs
that
are
deemed
to
be
functions
of
different
variables
whereas
in
parlance
variable
cost
means
a
cost
deemed
to
vary
in
direct
proportion
to
changes
in
rate
of
output
in
the
type
of
analysis
now
under
review
variable
cost
has
been
used
more
broadly
so
as
to
cover
costs
which
while
a
function
of
some
one
variable
such
as
output
of
energy
or
number
of
customers
are
not
necessarily
a
linear
function
already
noted
in
an
earlier
paragraph
the
more
familiar
cost
analyses
of
utility
enterprises
or
utility
systems
divide
the
total
costs
among
a
number
of
major
classes
of
service
such
as
residential
commercial
industrial
power
street
lighting
grand
division
permits
many
costs
to
be
assigned
in
their
entirety
to
some
one
class
such
as
street
lighting
or
at
least
to
be
excluded
completely
from
some
important
class
or
classes
industrial
power
service
for
example
would
not
be
charged
with
any
share
of
the
maintenance
costs
or
capital
costs
of
the
distribution
lines
the
major
portions
of
the
total
costs
of
a
utility
business
are
common
or
joint
to
all
or
nearly
all
classes
of
customers
and
these
costs
must
somehow
be
apportioned
among
the
various
classes
and
then
must
somehow
be
reapportioned
among
the
units
of
service
in
order
to
report
unit
costs
that
can
serve
as
tentative
measures
of
reasonable
rates
general
basis
on
which
these
common
costs
are
assigned
to
differently
measured
units
of
service
will
be
illustrated
by
the
following
highly
simplified
problem
of
an
cost
analysis
before
turning
to
this
example
we
must
distinguish
two
subtypes
of
analysis
both
of
which
belong
to
the
type
rather
than
to
the
type
the
first
subtype
the
analyst
following
the
practice
of
railroad
analysis
in
this
particular
respect
distributes
both
total
operating
costs
and
total
annual
capital
costs
including
an
allowance
for
cost
of
capital
or
fair
rate
of
return
among
the
different
classes
and
units
of
service
an
apportionment
say
of
of
the
total
costs
to
residential
service
as
a
class
would
include
an
allowance
of
perhaps
per
cent
as
the
cost
of
whatever
capital
is
deemed
to
have
been
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
residential
consumers
in
the
second
subtype
which
take
to
be
the
one
more
frequently
applied
only
the
operating
expenses
and
not
the
cost
of
capital
or
fair
return
are
apportioned
directly
among
the
various
classes
of
service
be
sure
the
capital
investments
in
or
alternatively
the
estimated
fair
values
of
the
plant
and
equipment
are
apportioned
among
the
different
classes
as
are
also
the
gross
revenues
received
from
the
sales
of
the
different
services
any
resulting
excess
of
revenues
received
from
a
given
class
of
service
over
the
operating
costs
imputed
to
this
class
is
reported
as
a
return
realized
on
the
capital
investment
attributed
to
the
same
service
during
any
given
year
if
the
revenues
from
the
residential
service
are
if
the
operating
expenses
imputed
to
this
class
of
service
come
to
and
if
the
net
investment
in
or
value
of
the
plant
and
equipment
deemed
devoted
to
this
service
amounts
to
the
cost
analyst
will
report
that
residential
service
in
the
aggregate
has
yielded
a
return
of
or
per
cent
services
will
show
different
rates
of
return
some
probably
much
lower
and
some
higher
are
obvious
reasons
of
convenience
for
this
practice
of
excluding
cost
of
capital
from
the
direct
apportionment
of
annual
costs
among
the
different
classes
of
service
notably
the
avoidance
of
the
controversial
question
what
rate
of
return
should
be
held
to
constitute
cost
of
capital
or
fair
rate
of
return
the
practice
is
likely
to
be
misleading
since
it
may
seem
to
support
a
conclusion
that
as
long
as
the
revenues
from
any
class
of
service
cover
the
imputed
operating
expenses
plus
some
return
on
capital
investment
however
low
the
rates
of
charge
for
this
service
are
compensatory
to
say
any
such
inference
would
be
quite
unwarranted
the
reason
just
suggested
shall
assume
the
use
of
the
first
subtype
of
fully
distributed
cost
apportionment
in
the
following
simplified
example
is
to
say
an
allowance
for
cost
of
capital
will
be
assumed
to
be
included
directly
in
the
cost
apportionment
analysis
of
the
costs
of
an
electric
utility
business
order
to
simplify
the
exposition
of
a
typical
fully
apportioned
cost
analysis
let
us
assume
the
application
of
the
analysis
to
an
electric
utility
company
supplying
a
single
city
with
power
generated
by
its
own
plant
us
also
assume
the
existence
of
only
one
class
or
type
of
service
all
of
which
is
supplied
at
the
same
voltage
phase
to
residential
commercial
and
industrial
customers
latter
assumption
will
permit
us
to
center
attention
on
the
most
controversial
aspect
of
modern
public
utility
cost
analysis
the
distinction
among
costs
that
are
functions
of
outputs
of
the
same
service
measured
along
different
dimensions
the
company
under
review
is
supplying
what
we
are
here
regarding
as
only
one
kind
of
service
we
might
suppose
that
the
problem
of
total
cost
apportionment
would
be
very
simple
indeed
that
it
would
be
limited
to
a
finding
of
the
total
annual
operating
and
capital
costs
of
the
business
followed
by
a
calculation
of
this
total
in
terms
of
annual
cost
per
of
consumption
fact
however
the
problem
is
not
so
simple
a
statement
of
costs
per
would
ignore
the
fact
that
many
of
these
costs
are
not
a
function
of
output
or
consumption
of
energy
recognition
of
multiple
cost
functions
is
therefore
required
simplest
division
and
the
one
most
frequently
used
with
subdivisions
in
gas
and
electric
rate
cases
is
a
threefold
division
of
the
total
operating
and
capital
costs
into
customer
costs
energy
or
volumetric
costs
and
demand
or
capacity
costs
this
threefold
division
of
costs
were
to
have
its
counterpart
in
the
actual
rates
of
charge
for
service
as
it
actually
does
have
in
some
rates
there
would
result
a
rate
for
any
one
class
of
service
example
the
monthly
bill
of
a
residential
consumer
might
be
the
sum
of
a
customer
charge
a
charge
for
of
energy
at
per
and
a
charge
for
a
maximum
demand
of
kilowatts
during
the
month
at
the
rate
of
per
kilowatt
a
total
bill
of
for
that
month
our
present
interest
lies
in
the
measurement
of
costs
of
service
and
only
indirectly
in
rates
that
may
or
may
not
be
designed
to
cover
these
costs
us
therefore
consider
each
of
the
three
types
of
cost
in
turn
recognizing
that
this
simplified
classification
is
used
only
for
illustrative
purposes
costs
actually
vary
in
much
more
complex
ways
customer
costs
are
those
operating
and
capital
costs
found
to
vary
with
number
of
customers
regardless
or
almost
regardless
of
power
consumption
as
a
minimum
are
the
costs
of
metering
and
billing
along
with
whatever
other
expenses
the
company
must
incur
in
taking
on
another
consumer
minimum
costs
may
come
to
per
month
more
or
less
for
residential
and
small
commercial
customers
although
they
are
substantially
higher
for
large
industrial
users
who
require
more
costly
connections
and
metering
devices
costs
on
this
order
are
sometimes
separately
charged
for
in
residential
and
commercial
rates
in
the
form
of
a
mere
service
charge
they
are
more
frequently
wholly
or
partly
covered
by
a
minimum
charge
which
entitles
the
consumer
to
a
very
small
amount
of
gas
or
electricity
with
no
further
payment
the
really
controversial
aspect
of
imputation
arises
because
of
the
cost
frequent
practice
of
including
not
just
those
costs
that
can
be
definitely
earmarked
as
incurred
for
the
benefit
of
specific
customers
but
also
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
annual
maintenance
and
capital
costs
of
the
secondary
distribution
system
a
fraction
equal
to
the
estimated
annual
costs
of
a
hypothetical
system
of
minimum
capacity
preconditions

remained

unexamined

be
assigned
to
the

become
painfully
clear
that
the
very
attempt
to
make
the

of
social

free
of

by
erecting

and

is
itself
a

push
to
confine
the

behaviour
to

has
led
sociology
perilously
close
to
the
reduction
of
the
word

to
mean
a
small
group
in
which
certain
relations
between

can
be
studied
think
the
role
of

philosopher
becomes
apparent
simple
pragmatic
success
of
the
sociology
of

needs
to
be
questioned
if
the
small
group
notion
involves
the
implicit
claim
that
the
phenomena
of
sociological
investigations
are
of
atomic
or
subatomic
proportions
the

needs
to
know
the

may
have
great
practical
use
in
the

yet
it
is
perfectly
clear
as
and
indicate
that
the
concept

in
sociology
has
been
built
up
from
physiological
and
biological
models
in
which
the
notions
of

are
central

a

is
therefore
not
a

rather
an
indirect
consequence
of
philosophical
inference
and
judgment
purpose
of
this
sort
of
philosophical
study
of
sociology
is
not
to
tyrannize
but
to
clarify
the
principles
of

is
absurd
to
speak
of
philosophy
as
a
superior
enterprise
to
sociology
since
the
former
is
a
logical
rational
discipline
where
sociology
is
essentially
descriptive
and
empirical
a
position
entails
the
negation
of
philosophy
in
its
form
as
something
soaring
above
and
embracing
the
empirical

contrary
to

manifest
to

approach
that
does
not
descend
to

sensationalism
when
philosophy
attempts
to
stand
above

to
dictate
the
conditions
of
empirical
research
it
becomes
formal

shaping
the
contours
of
life
to
fit
the
needs
of

notion
of
philosophy
as
may
fit
well
with
authoritarian
modes
of
political
ideology
but
it
has
been
noted
that
the
price
of
such
an
imperial
notion
of
philosophy
is
the
frustration
and
flagellation
of
the
social
sciences
is
no
longer
a
direct
grappling
with
nature
as
it
was
in
antiquity
has
surrendered
any
claims
of
description
in

of
psychological
accounts

mocked
for

a

ditch

to
save
the

at
the
expense
of
men
is
not
positivism
which
has
isolated
metaphysics
from
reality
by
distinguishing
between
description
and
prescription
is
simply
revealing
the
state
to
which
metaphysical
thinking
has
fallen
during
this
century
the
traditional
four
fields
of
philosophy
logic
ethics
epistemology
and
esthetics
is
a
commonplace
that
to
the
degree
these
special
preserves
of
past
philosophic
hunting
grounds
establish
an
empirical
content
and
suitable
methodological
criteria
they
move
away
from
philosophy
as
such
is
left
to
traditional
systems
of
philosophy
is
in
effect
only
the
history
of
these
fields
prior
to
their
becoming
rigorous
enough
to
abide
by
the
canons
of
scientific
method
this
situation
philosophy
has
survived
by
separating
itself
from
metaphysics
by
showing
the
ultimate
questions
to
be
the
meaningless
questions
relinquishing
by
philosophy
of
pretentious
claims
to
empirical
priority
gives
it
an
ability
to
treat
problems
of
meaning
and
truth
which
in
the
past
it
was
unable
to
examine
because
of
its
missionary
attitude
to
knowledge
of
more
humble
sorts
the
new
situation
philosophy
is
able
to
provide
the
social
sciences
with
the
same
guidance
that
mathematics
offers
the
physical
sciences
a
reservoir
of
logical
relations
that
can
be
used
in
framing
hypotheses
having
explanatory
and
predictive
value
this
philosophy
may
urge
the
social
sciences
forward
by
asking
the
type
of
question
that
falls
outside
the
present
scope
of
social
inquiry
but
within
its
potential
domain
of
relevance
this
connection
it
might
be
noted
that
the
theory
of
games
was
a
mathematical
discovery
long
before
its
uses
in
political
science
were
exploited
formulated
the
nebular
hypothesis
according
to
which
the
solar
system
was
evolved
from
a
rotating
mass
of
incandescent
gas
nearly
a
half
century
before
its
scientific
value
was
made
plain
by
in
his
does
not
mean
that
philosophy
resolves
the
problems
it
generates
any
more
so
than
geometry
settled
the
physical
status
of
the
continuum
the
forceful
presentation
of
new
issues
for
the
sciences
to
work
on
is
itself
a
monumental
task
those
raised
on
and
das
this
may
seem
a
modest
role
for
philosophy
modesty
and
triviality
are
different
qualities
conceived
of
as
servant
to
the
sciences
might
appear
as
less
dramatic
than
philosophy
which
jeers
as
the
sciences
evolve
ceaseless
effort
to
understand
and
measure
the
distance
mankind
has
traversed
since
its
primitive
anthropological
status
offers
a
more
durable
sort
of
drama
clarifying
fundamental
premises
in
the
social
sciences
and
defining
the
logical
problems
emergent
at
the
borderlands
of
each
new
scientific
discipline
philosophy
can
offer
the
sort
of
distinction
that
can
accelerate
growth
in
human
understanding
can
prevent
the
working
scientist
from
becoming
slothful
and
by
noting
the
assumptions
and
level
at
which
a
hypothesis
or
theory
is
framed
dissection
of
scientific
theory
the
examination
of
a
theory
from
the
of
language
epistemology
and
ethics
is
itself
a
distinct
contribution
to
knowledge
no
less
so
because
of
its
removal
from
empirical
research
realm
of
science
whatever
the
degree
of
precision
in
formulations
covers
the
range
of
prediction
and
explanation
and
philosophy
is
conceived
to
be
its
rationalist
logistic
attitude
to
evidence
should
make
it
clear
that
it
is
something
other
than
science
some
forms
of
philosophy
this
very
division
between
the
empirical
and
the
rational
becomes
a
sign
of
the
metaphysical
superiority
of
the
latter
and
announce
that
the
secret
is
the
center
of
a
philosophy
and
thereafter
a
hundred
followers
declare
secrecy
a
higher
verity
is
simply
a
confession
of
intellectual
sterility
spruced
up
to
look
virtuous
as
indicated
it
is
not
the
secret
which
is
important
but
the
removal
of
secrecy
this
philosophy
and
science
share
a
common
goal
hypostatization
of
the
secret
nonetheless
guarantees
that
the
division
of
analytical
and
synthetic
philosophies
shall
not
be
overcome
by
even
the
most
persuasive
argument
for
this
division
is
but
an
abstract
representation
of
the
social
struggle
between
mysticism
and
science
mystification
of
metaphysical
systems
does
not
imply
the
demise
of
philosophy
only
the
close
of
a
philosophic
age
which
demanded
metaphysics
to
be
rational
and
logical
tenacity
with
which
present
metaphysical
attitudes
fetishize
private
intuition
offers
the
strongest
evidence
that
the
gulf
between
scientific
and
delphic
ways
of
philosophizing
is
built
into
the
present
conflict
over
the
limits
and
purpose
of
science
religion
and
ideology
systems
and
this
includes
even
the
relation
of
mechanist
to
relativist
physics
are
built
upon
refined
and
corrected
systems
by
the
very
nature
of
their
completeness
are
overthrown
by
rival
systems
addition
to
the
incompleteness
of
science
and
the
completeness
of
metaphysics
they
differ
in
that
science
is
essentially
descriptive
while
philosophy
in
its
inherited
forms
tends
to
be
teleological
and
prescriptive
threadbare
notion
that
belief
unlike
behaviour
is
not
subject
to
objective
analysis
has
placed
intuitive
metaphysics
squarely
against
the
sociology
of
knowledge
since
it
is
precisely
the
job
of
the
sociology
of
knowledge
to
treat
beliefs
as
social
facts
no
less
viable
than
social
behaviour
dealing
with
the
actual
relation
of
philosophy
to
the
sociology
of
knowledge
or
better
the
role
of
philosophy
in
assisting
research
on
the
social
sources
of
ideas
one
has
to
become
necessarily
selective
features
we
have
touched
upon
philosophy
as
a
logical
deductive
system
from
which
a
social
science
methodology
can
be
built
up
philosophic
analysis
of
the
assumptions
and
presumptions
of
the
social
sciences
and
philosophy
as
a
guide
to
possible
integration
of
supposedly
disparate
sociological
investigations
objection
will
be
raised
that
the
most
important
role
of
philosophy
in
relation
to
social
science
has
been
omitted
namely
the
status
of
ultimate
value
questions
and
norms
operative
in
the
social
sciences
it
will
be
asked
whether
the
real
questions
people
ask
are
not
the
ultimate
questions
that
social
science
finds
itself
impotent
in
the
face
of
then
is
the
status
of
such
questions
as
is
society
the
ground
of
human
existence
or
a
means
to
an
individual
goal
societies
develop
according
to
cosmic
patterns
or
are
they
subject
only
to
the
free
choice
of
individuals
society
really
exist
as
an
entity
over
and
above
the
agglomeration
of
men
think
it
must
be
said
that
contrary
to
metaphysical
insistence
these
are
questions
so
framed
as
to
defy
either
empirical
exploration
or
rational
solutions
and
indicated
questions
of
whether
the
value
of
life
is
individual
or
social
are
not
questions
but
assertions
of
faith
made
to
appear
as
legitimate
questions
assume
that
answers
of
concrete
significance
can
be
supplied
to
statements
involving
undefined
universals
theory
has
no
more
right
to
expect
results
from
meaningless
questions
than
physics
has
the
right
to
expect
a
theological
solution
to
the
controversy
is
not
that
such
questions
are
not
asked
is
rather
that
introducing
them
into
social
analysis
reflects
not
so
much
a
search
for
truth
as
for
certainty
operational
approach
to
sociology
can
never
expect
abstract
certainty
since
it
is
certainty
which
every
new
discovery
in
science
either
replaces
or
reshapes
raise
the
added
objection
that
men
require
certainty
on
psychological
grounds
answers
to
ultimate
questions
having
an
irrational
rather
than
scientific
basis
is
in
a
real
sense
to
undermine
the
objection
itself
what
concerns
all
scientific
disciplines
is
precisely
that
which
can
be
captured
for
the
rational
for
the
scientific
determination
of
what
in
past
ages
was
considered
ultimate
and
irrational
philosophy
which
attempts
to
supply
ultimate
answers
in
an
ultimate
way
reveals
its
acquiescence
in
the
shortcomings
of
men
an
impatience
with
partial
tentative
solutions
have
always
lived
in
a
tentative
world
and
in
suspension
of
ultimate
judgments
where
and
when
necessary
overcoming
itself
is
the
precondition
of
the
quest
for
new
and
more
precise
information
about
the
world
such
uncertainty
we
are
left
with
a
set
of
dogmas
and
myths
functional
interplay
of
philosophy
and
science
should
as
a
minimum
guarantee
a
meaningful
option
to
degree
of
indefiniteness
is
a
salutary
condition
for
the
growth
of
science
neither
was
the
statement
empirical
for
goodness
was
not
a
quality
like
red
or
squeaky
that
could
be
seen
or
heard
were
they
to
do
then
with
these
awkward
judgments
of
value
find
a
place
for
them
in
their
theory
of
knowledge
would
require
them
to
revise
the
theory
radically
and
yet
that
theory
was
what
they
regarded
as
their
most
important
discovery
appeared
that
the
theory
could
be
saved
in
one
way
only
it
could
be
shown
that
judgments
of
good
and
bad
were
not
judgments
at
all
that
they
asserted
nothing
true
or
false
but
merely
expressed
emotions
like
or
then
these
wayward
judgments
would
cease
from
troubling
and
weary
heads
could
be
at
rest
is
the
course
the
positivists
took
explained
value
judgments
by
explaining
them
away
do
not
think
their
view
will
do
before
discussing
it
should
like
to
record
one
vote
of
thanks
to
them
for
the
clarity
with
which
they
have
stated
their
case
has
been
said
of
that
he
wrote
so
clearly
that
he
could
be
found
out
theory
has
been
put
so
clearly
and
precisely
that
it
deserves
criticism
of
the
same
kind
and
this
will
do
my
best
to
supply
theory
claims
to
show
by
analysis
that
when
we
say
is
good
we
do
not
mean
to
assert
a
character
of
the
subject
of
which
we
are
thinking
shall
argue
that
we
do
mean
to
do
just
that
us
work
through
an
example
and
the
simpler
and
commoner
the
better
is
perhaps
no
value
statement
on
which
people
would
more
universally
agree
than
the
statement
that
intense
pain
is
bad
us
take
a
set
of
circumstances
in
which
happen
to
be
interested
on
the
legislative
side
and
in
which
think
every
one
of
us
might
naturally
make
such
a
statement
come
upon
a
rabbit
that
has
been
caught
in
one
of
the
brutal
traps
in
common
use
are
signs
that
it
has
struggled
for
days
to
escape
and
that
in
a
frenzy
of
hunger
pain
and
fear
it
has
all
but
eaten
off
its
own
leg
attempt
failed
the
animal
is
now
dead
we
think
of
the
long
and
excruciating
pain
it
must
have
suffered
we
are
very
likely
to
say
was
a
bad
thing
that
the
little
animal
should
suffer
so
positivist
tells
us
that
when
we
say
this
we
are
only
expressing
our
present
emotion
hold
on
the
contrary
that
we
mean
to
assert
something
of
the
pain
itself
namely
that
it
was
bad
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
what
follows
from
the
positivist
view
that
view
nothing
good
or
bad
happened
in
the
case
until
came
on
the
scene
and
made
my
remark
what
express
in
my
remark
is
something
going
on
in
me
at
the
time
and
that
of
course
did
not
exist
until
did
come
on
the
scene
pain
of
the
rabbit
was
not
itself
bad
nothing
evil
was
happening
when
that
pain
was
being
endured
badness
in
the
only
sense
in
which
it
is
involved
at
all
waited
for
its
appearance
till
came
and
looked
and
felt
that
this
is
at
odds
with
our
meaning
may
be
shown
as
follows
us
put
to
ourselves
the
hypothesis
that
we
had
not
come
on
the
scene
and
that
the
rabbit
never
was
discovered
we
prepared
to
say
that
in
that
case
nothing
bad
occurred
in
the
sense
in
which
we
said
it
did
not
we
should
say
on
the
contrary
that
the
accident
of
our
later
discovery
made
no
difference
whatever
to
the
badness
of
the
pain
that
it
would
have
been
every
whit
as
bad
whether
a
chance
happened
later
to
discover
the
body
and
feel
repugnance
or
not
so
then
it
is
clear
that
in
saying
the
suffering
was
bad
we
are
not
expressing
our
feelings
only
are
saying
that
the
pain
was
bad
when
and
as
it
occurred
and
before
anyone
took
an
attitude
toward
it
first
argument
is
thus
an
ideal
experiment
in
which
we
use
the
method
of
difference
removes
our
present
expression
and
shows
that
the
badness
we
meant
would
not
be
affected
by
this
whereas
on
positivist
grounds
it
should
be
second
argument
applies
the
method
in
the
reverse
way
ideally
removes
the
past
event
and
shows
that
this
would
render
false
what
we
mean
to
say
whereas
on
positivist
grounds
it
should
not
us
suppose
that
the
animal
did
not
in
fact
fall
into
the
trap
and
did
not
suffer
at
all
but
that
we
mistakenly
believe
it
did
and
say
as
before
that
its
suffering
was
an
evil
thing
the
positivist
theory
everything
sought
to
express
by
calling
it
evil
in
the
first
case
is
still
present
in
the
second
the
only
sense
in
which
badness
is
involved
at
all
whatever
was
bad
in
the
first
case
is
still
present
in
its
entirety
since
all
that
is
expressed
in
either
case
is
a
state
of
feeling
and
that
feeling
is
still
there
our
question
is
is
such
an
implication
consistent
with
what
we
meant
it
is
not
anyone
asked
us
after
we
made
the
remark
that
the
suffering
was
a
bad
thing
whether
we
should
think
it
relevant
to
what
we
said
to
learn
that
the
incident
had
never
occurred
and
no
pain
had
been
suffered
at
all
we
should
say
that
it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
that
what
we
were
asserting
to
be
bad
was
precisely
the
suffering
we
thought
had
occurred
back
there
that
if
this
had
not
occurred
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
bad
and
that
our
assertion
was
in
that
case
mistaken
suggestion
that
in
saying
something
evil
had
occurred
we
were
after
all
making
no
mistake
because
we
had
never
meant
anyhow
to
say
anything
about
the
past
suffering
seems
to
me
merely
frivolous
we
did
not
mean
to
say
this
why
should
we
be
so
relieved
on
finding
that
the
suffering
had
not
occurred
the
theory
before
us
such
relief
would
be
groundless
for
in
that
suffering
itself
there
was
nothing
bad
at
all
and
hence
in
its
nonoccurrence
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
relieved
about
positivist
theory
would
here
distort
our
meaning
beyond
recognition
far
as
can
see
there
is
only
one
way
out
for
the
positivist
holds
that
goodness
and
badness
lie
in
feelings
of
approval
or
disapproval
there
is
a
way
in
which
he
might
hold
that
badness
did
in
this
case
precede
our
own
feeling
of
disapproval
without
belonging
to
the
pain
itself
pain
in
itself
was
neutral
but
unfortunately
the
rabbit
on
no
grounds
at
all
took
up
toward
this
neutral
object
an
attitude
of
disapproval
and
that
made
it
for
the
first
time
and
in
the
only
intelligible
sense
bad
way
of
escape
is
theoretically
possible
but
since
it
has
grave
difficulties
of
its
own
and
has
not
so
far
as
know
been
urged
by
positivists
it
is
perhaps
best
not
to
spend
time
over
it
come
now
to
a
third
argument
which
again
is
very
simple
we
come
upon
the
rabbit
and
make
our
remark
about
its
suffering
being
a
bad
thing
we
presumably
make
it
with
some
feeling
the
positivists
are
plainly
right
in
saying
that
such
remarks
do
usually
express
feeling
suppose
that
a
week
later
we
revert
to
the
incident
in
thought
and
make
our
statement
again
suppose
that
the
circumstances
have
now
so
changed
that
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
the
remark
in
the
first
place
has
faded
pathetic
evidence
is
no
longer
before
us
and
we
are
now
so
fatigued
in
body
and
mind
that
feeling
is
as
we
say
quite
dead
these
circumstances
since
what
was
expressed
by
the
remark
when
first
made
is
on
the
theory
before
us
simply
absent
the
remark
now
expresses
nothing
is
as
empty
as
the
word
would
be
when
there
was
no
enthusiasm
behind
it
this
seems
to
me
untrue
we
repeat
the
remark
that
such
suffering
was
a
bad
thing
the
feeling
with
which
we
made
it
last
week
may
be
at
or
near
the
vanishing
point
but
if
we
were
asked
whether
we
meant
to
say
what
we
did
before
we
should
certainly
answer
should
say
that
we
made
our
point
with
feeling
the
first
time
and
little
or
no
feeling
the
second
time
but
that
it
was
the
same
point
we
were
making
if
we
can
see
that
what
we
meant
to
say
remains
the
same
while
the
feeling
varies
from
intensity
to
near
zero
it
is
not
the
feeling
that
we
primarily
meant
to
express
come
now
to
a
fourth
consideration
all
believe
that
toward
acts
or
effects
of
a
certain
kind
one
attitude
is
fitting
and
another
not
but
on
the
theory
before
us
such
a
belief
would
not
make
sense
and
have
lately
contended
that
this
fitness
is
one
of
the
main
facts
of
ethics
and
suspect
they
are
right
that
is
not
exactly
my
point
point
is
this
whether
there
is
such
fitness
or
not
we
all
assume
that
there
is
and
if
we
do
we
express
in
moral
judgments
more
than
the
subjectivists
say
we
do
me
illustrate
his
novel
tells
of
his
experiences
in
a
prison
camp
the
unhappy
inmates
of
such
camps
are
like
today
companions
were
about
as
grim
a
lot
as
can
be
imagined
have
heard
stories
he
writes
of
the
most
terrible
the
most
unnatural
actions
of
the
most
monstrous
murders
told
with
the
most
spontaneous
childishly
merry
laughter
of
us
would
say
that
in
this
delight
at
the
killing
of
others
or
the
causing
of
suffering
there
is
something
very
unfitting
we
were
asked
why
we
thought
so
we
should
say
that
these
things
involve
great
evil
and
are
wrong
and
that
to
take
delight
in
what
is
evil
or
wrong
is
plainly
unfitting
on
the
subjectivist
view
this
answer
is
ruled
out
before
someone
takes
up
an
attitude
toward
death
suffering
or
their
infliction
they
have
no
moral
quality
at
all
is
therefore
nothing
about
them
to
which
an
attitude
of
approval
or
condemnation
could
be
fitting
are
in
themselves
neutral
and
so
far
as
they
get
a
moral
quality
they
get
it
only
through
being
invested
with
it
by
the
attitude
of
the
onlooker
if
that
is
true
why
is
any
attitude
more
fitting
than
any
other
applause
for
example
be
fitting
if
apart
from
the
applause
there
were
nothing
good
to
applaud
condemnation
be
fitting
if
independently
of
the
condemnation
there
were
nothing
bad
to
condemn
such
a
case
any
attitude
would
be
as
fitting
or
unfitting
as
any
other
which
means
that
the
notion
of
fitness
has
lost
all
point
we
are
forced
to
go
much
farther
goodness
and
badness
lie
in
attitudes
only
and
hence
are
brought
into
being
by
them
those
men
who
greeted
death
and
misery
with
childishly
merry
laughter
are
taking
the
only
sensible
line
there
is
nothing
evil
in
these
things
if
they
get
their
moral
complexion
only
from
our
feeling
about
them
why
they
be
greeted
with
a
cheer
greet
them
with
repulsion
would
turn
what
before
was
neutral
into
something
bad
it
would
needlessly
bring
badness
into
the
world
and
even
on
subjectivist
assumptions
that
does
not
seem
very
bright
the
other
hand
to
greet
them
with
delight
would
convert
what
before
was
neutral
into
something
good
it
would
bring
goodness
into
the
world
injured
veteran
was
a
former
miner
years
old
who
had
been
wounded
by
shrapnel
in
the
back
of
the
head
resulted
in
damage
to
the
occipital
lobe
and
very
probably
to
the
left
side
of
the
cerebellum
also
any
event
the
extraordinary
result
of
this
injury
was
that
he
became
psychically
blind
while
at
the
same
time
apparently
the
sense
of
touch
remained
essentially
intact
blindness
is
a
condition
in
which
there
is
a
total
absence
of
visual
a
condition
in
which
for
example
one
is
unable
to
remember
something
just
seen
or
to
conjure
up
a
of
the
visible
appearance
of
a
friend
in
his
absence
circumstance
in
the
case
plus
the
fact
that
his
tactual
capacity
remained
basically
in
sound
working
order
constitutes
its
exceptional
value
for
the
problem
at
hand
since
the
evidence
presented
by
the
authors
is
overwhelming
that
when
the
patient
closed
his
eyes
he
had
absolutely
no
spatial
that
is
awareness
whatsoever
necessary
inference
as
the
authors
themselves
interpret
it
would
seem
to
be
this
qualities
are
not
among
those
grasped
by
the
sense
of
touch
as
such
do
not
arrive
at
spatial
images
by
means
of
the
sense
of
touch
by
itself
becomes
part
of
the
tactual
sensation
only
by
way
of
visual
representations
that
is
there
is
in
the
true
sense
only
a
visual
space
underlying
assumption
of
course
is
that
only
sight
and
touch
enable
us
in
any
precise
and
fully
dependable
way
to
locate
objects
in
space
beyond
us
the
other
senses
being
decidedly
inferior
if
not
totally
inadequate
in
this
regard
is
an
assumption
with
which
few
would
be
disposed
to
quarrel
if
the
sense
of
touch
is
functioning
normally
and
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
spatial
awareness
in
a
person
when
the
eyes
are
closed
and
an
object
is
handled
the
conclusion
seems
unavoidable
that
touch
by
itself
cannot
focus
and
take
possession
of
the
of
things
and
that
actual
sight
or
visual
representations
are
necessary
force
of
the
analysis
if
indeed
it
has
any
force
can
be
felt
by
the
reader
believe
only
after
three
questions
have
been
successfully
answered
allows
us
to
think
that
the
patient
had
no
representations
when
his
eyes
were
closed
evidence
is
there
that
he
was
psychically
blind
can
we
be
sure
that
his
sense
of
touch
was
not
profoundly
disturbed
by
his
head
injury
shall
consider
these
in
the
inverse
order
of
their
presentation
a
satisfactory
answer
to
the
third
question
is
imperative
if
the
argument
is
to
get
under
way
at
all
for
if
there
is
any
possibility
of
doubt
whether
the
tactual
sensitivity
had
been
impaired
by
the
occipital
lesion
any
findings
whatsoever
in
regard
to
the
first
question
become
completely
ambiguous
and
fail
altogether
of
course
as
evidence
to
establish
the
desired
conclusion
answer
the
authors
give
to
it
therefore
is
of
supreme
importance
is
as
follows
usual
sensitivity
tests
showed
that
the
specific
qualities
of
pressure
pain
temperature
as
well
as
the
kinesthetic
sensations
muscular
feelings
feelings
in
the
tendons
and
joints
were
as
such
essentially
intact
although
they
seemed
in
comparison
with
normal
reactions
to
be
somewhat
diminished
over
the
entire
body
supposed
tactual
sense
of
spatial
location
and
orientation
in
the
patient
and
his
ability
to
specify
the
location
of
a
member
as
well
as
the
direction
and
scope
of
a
movement
passively
executed
with
one
of
his
members
proved
to
have
been
on
the
contrary
very
considerably
affected
authors
insist
however
that
these
abnormalities
in
the
sense
of
touch
were
due
absolutely
to
no
organic
disorders
in
that
sense
faculty
but
rather
to
the
injuries
which
the
patient
had
sustained
to
the
sense
of
sight
of
all
what
is
their
evidence
that
the
tactual
apparatus
was
fundamentally
undamaged
an
object
was
placed
in
the
hand
he
had
no
difficulty
determining
whether
it
was
warm
or
cold
sharp
or
blunt
rough
or
smooth
flexible
soft
or
hard
and
he
could
tell
simply
by
the
feel
of
it
whether
it
was
made
of
wood
iron
cloth
rubber
and
so
on
he
could
recognize
by
touch
alone
articles
which
he
had
handled
immediately
before
even
though
they
were
altogether
unfamiliar
to
him
and
could
not
be
identified
by
him
that
is
he
was
unaware
what
kind
of
objects
they
were
or
what
their
use
was
patient
attained
an
astonishing
efficiency
in
a
new
trade
of
his
brain
injury
and
the
extreme
damage
suffered
to
his
sight
the
patient
had
to
train
himself
for
a
new
line
of
work
that
of
a
an
occupation
requiring
a
great
deal
of
precision
in
the
making
of
measurements
and
a
fairly
sense
of
form
and
contour
seems
clear
when
one
takes
into
consideration
the
exceedingly
defective
eyesight
of
the
patient
we
shall
describe
it
in
detail
in
connection
with
our
second
question
the
one
concerning
the
psychical
blindness
of
the
patient
that
he
had
to
rely
on
his
sense
of
touch
much
more
than
the
usual
and
that
consequently
that
faculty
was
most
probably
more
sensitive
to
shape
and
size
than
that
of
a
person
with
normal
vision
so
the
authors
conclude
conduct
of
the
patient
in
his
life
and
in
his
work
even
more
than
the
foregoing
facts
mentioned
above
under
leave
positively
no
room
for
doubt
that
the
sense
of
touch
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
was
unaffected
or
to
put
the
same
thing
in
physiological
terms
that
the
of
the
tactual
apparatus
from
the
periphery
up
to
the
tactual
centers
in
the
brain
that
is
from
one
end
to
the
other
was
unimpaired
the
argument
is
accepted
as
essentially
sound
up
to
this
point
it
remains
for
us
to
consider
whether
the
difficulties
in
orienting
himself
spatially
and
in
locating
objects
in
space
with
the
sense
of
touch
can
be
explained
by
his
defective
visual
condition
before
we
can
do
this
we
must
first
find
answers
to
our
original
questions
and
then
we
shall
perhaps
be
in
a
position
to
provide
something
like
a
complete
answer
to
the
question
at
hand
what
ways
then
did
the
psychical
blindness
manifest
itself
could
not
see
objects
as
unified
and
organized
figures
as
a
person
does
with
normal
vision
meaning
of
this
as
we
shall
see
is
that
he
had
no
fund
of
visual
of
objects
as
objects
and
therefore
he
could
not
recognize
even
things
upon
seeing
them
again
he
constantly
became
lost
in
parts
and
components
of
them
confused
some
of
their
details
with
those
of
neighboring
objects
and
so
on
unless
he
allowed
time
to
trace
the
object
in
question
through
minute
movements
of
the
head
and
hands
and
in
this
way
to
discover
its
contours
to
his
own
testimony
he
never
actually
saw
things
as
shaped
but
only
as
generally
amorphous
blots
of
color
of
a
more
or
less
indefinite
size
at
their
edges
they
slipped
pretty
much
out
of
focus
altogether
by
the
tracing
procedure
he
could
in
a
strange
obviously
kinesthetic
manner
find
the
unseen
form
could
piece
as
it
were
the
jumbled
mass
together
into
an
organized
whole
and
then
recognize
it
as
a
man
or
a
triangle
or
whatever
it
turned
out
to
be
however
the
figure
to
be
discerned
were
complicated
composed
of
several
interlocking
subfigures
and
so
on
even
the
tracing
process
failed
him
and
he
could
not
focus
even
relatively
simple
shapes
among
its
parts
meant
concretely
that
the
patient
could
not
read
at
all
without
making
movements
of
the
head
or
body
became
easily
confused
by
hasher
marks
inserted
between
words
and
thus
confused
the
mark
for
one
of
the
letters
and
could
recognize
a
simple
straight
line
or
a
curved
one
only
by
tracing
it
patient
himself
denied
that
he
had
any
visual
imagery
at
all
and
there
was
ample
evidence
of
the
following
sort
to
corroborate
him
a
conversation
with
another
man
he
was
able
to
recount
practically
everything
that
had
been
said
but
could
not
describe
at
all
what
the
other
man
looked
like
could
he
call
up
of
close
friends
or
relatives
short
both
his
own
declarations
and
his
figural
blindness
when
he
looked
at
objects
seem
to
present
undeniable
evidence
that
he
had
simply
no
visual
memory
at
all
was
oblivious
of
the
form
of
the
object
actually
being
viewed
precisely
because
he
could
not
assign
it
to
a
visual
shape
already
learned
and
held
in
visual
memory
as
persons
of
normal
vision
do
could
not
recognize
it
he
was
absolutely
unfamiliar
with
it
because
he
had
no
visual
memory
at
all
his
only
recourse
was
to
learn
the
shape
all
over
again
for
each
new
visual
experience
of
the
same
individual
object
or
type
of
object
and
this
he
could
do
only
by
going
over
its
mass
with
the
tracing
procedure
he
might
finally
recognize
it
apparently
by
combining
the
visual
blot
actually
being
seen
with
tactual
feelings
in
the
head
or
body
accompanying
the
tracing
movements
would
mean
it
can
readily
be
seen
that
again
for
each
new
visual
experience
the
tracing
motions
would
have
to
be
repeated
because
of
the
absence
of
visual
imagery
one
would
surmise
the
procedure
however
could
be
repeated
with
the
same
object
or
with
the
same
type
of
object
often
enough
so
that
the
corresponding
visual
blots
and
the
merest
beginning
of
the
tracing
movement
would
provide
clues
as
to
the
actual
shape
which
the
patient
then
immediately
could
determine
by
a
kind
of
inference
trees
automobiles
houses
and
so
on
objects
continually
confronted
in
everyday
life
had
each
its
characteristic
and
became
easily
recognizable
at
the
very
beginning
of
tracing
by
an
inference
as
to
what
each
was
for
example
he
inferred
from
black
dots
on
a
white
surface
evidently
could
not
actually
see
the
corners
of
these
objects
but
their
size
and
the
dots
gave
them
away
the
authors
give
numerous
instances
of
calculated
guessing
on
the
part
to
show
how
large
a
role
it
played
in
his
process
of
readapting
himself
and
how
proficient
he
became
at
it
he
seems
even
to
have
been
able
to
guess
correctly
without
the
tracing
motions
solely
on
the
basis
of
qualitative
differences
among
the
things
which
appeared
in
his
visual
experience
the
very
important
question
is
then
exactly
the
role
of
kinesthetic
sensations
in
the
ability
to
recognize
forms
and
shapes
by
means
of
the
tracing
movements
when
he
is
actually
looking
at
things
has
now
been
raised
in
the
mind
and
in
the
following
form
the
patient
can
perceive
figure
kinesthetically
when
he
cannot
perceive
it
visually
then
it
would
seem
the
sense
of
touch
has
immediate
contact
with
the
spatial
aspects
of
things
in
independence
of
visual
representations
at
least
in
regard
to
two
dimensions
and
as
we
shall
see
even
this
much
spatial
awareness
on
the
part
of
unaided
touch
is
denied
by
the
authors
then
do
the
kinesthetic
sensations
function
in
all
this
authors
set
about
answering
this
fundamental
question
through
a
detailed
investigation
of
the
ability
tactually
to
perceive
figure
and
to
locate
objects
in
space
with
his
eyes
closed
or
turned
away
from
the
object
concerned
naturally
they
make
the
investigation
first
by
prohibiting
the
patient
from
making
any
movements
at
all
and
then
later
by
repeating
it
and
allowing
the
patient
to
move
in
any
way
he
wanted
to
the
patient
was
not
allowed
to
move
his
body
in
any
way
at
all
the
following
striking
results
occurred
artists
indeed
turned
to
actual
representations
or
molded
figures
which
were
rare
down
to
they
tended
to
reflect
reality
see
a
schematic
abstract
treatment
of
men
and
animals
by
intent
rose
only
in
the
late
eighth
century
speak
of
this
underlying
view
of
the
world
is
to
embark
upon
matters
of
subjective
judgment
the
least
however
one
may
conclude
that
potters
sensed
a
logical
order
their
principles
of
composition
stand
very
close
to
those
which
appear
in
the
epics
and
the
hexameter
line
world
again
was
a
still
simple
traditional
age
which
was
only
slowly
beginning
to
appreciate
the
complexity
of
life
perhaps
an
observer
of
the
vases
will
not
go
too
far
in
deducing
that
the
outlook
of
their
makers
and
users
was
basically
stable
and
secure

perhaps
at
times
bore

repel

has
not

received
the
thorough
detailed
study
which
it
deserves
partly
because
the
task
is
a
mammoth
one
and
partly
because
some
of
its
local
manifestations
as
at
are
only
now
coming
to
light
even
a
cursory
inspection
of
its
many
aspects

the

can
deduce
several
fundamental
conclusions
about

progress
of
the

down
to

had
appeared
in

eleventh

now
consolidated

a
significant
degree
which
was
in

become
reasonably
well
developed

this
process
the
inheritance

been
transmuted

finally
rejected

from
that
which
rises
more
clearly
in
our
vision
after
modern
scholars
who
urge
that
we
must
keep
in
mind
the
fundamental
continuity
of
development
from
earliest
times
granted
occasional
irruptions
of
peoples
and
ideas
from
outside
are
correct
but
all
too
many
observers
have
been
misled
by
this
fact
into
minimizing
the
degree
of
change
which
took
place
in
the
early
first
millennium
focus
of
novelty
in
this
world
now
lay
in
the
districts
of
the
mainland
and
by
virtually
the
entire

excepting
its
northern
shores
had
accepted
the
style
of
pottery
vases
usually
turn
up
especially
outside
proper
together
with
as
many
or
more
examples
of
local
stamp
these
patterns
had
mostly
vanished
by
the
later
ninth

their
place
came
local
variations
within
the
common
style
tentative
as
it
were
in
products
but
truly
distinct
and
sharply
defined
as
the
spirit
developed
though
important
was
not
the
only
teacher
of
this
age
can
take
a
vase

without
any
knowledge

venture
to
assign

other
sequences

each
their

hallmarks
local
variations
were
to
become
ever
sharper
in
the
next
century

a
half

conclusions
can
be
drawn
from
the
other
physical
evidence
of
the

from
the
survivals

to
be
manifested
in

be
a
necessary

unfortunate
defect
born
of

lack

we

see
more
deeply
we
probably
would
find
many
side
issues
and
wrong

which
came

end

the
period
historian
can
only
point
out
those
lines
which
were
major
enough
to
find
reflection
in

limited
evidence

must
hope
that
future
excavations
will
enrich

understanding

clear
the

unmistakably
some
of

lines

for

centuries

not
easy

apply
the
evidence

this

certainly
taken

amazing
manifestations
of

potentialities
of

but
both
were
among
the

products
of
a
phase
which
was
ending
civilization
was
swirling
toward
its
great
revolution
in
which
the
developed
qualities
of
the
outlook
were
suddenly
to
break
forth
revolution
was
well
under
way
before
and
premonitory
signs
go
back
virtually
across
the
century

however

many
tokens
point
forward
the
main
achievements
stand
as
a
culmination
of
the
simple
patterns
of
the
ages
dominant

of
the
century

about
the

trade

just
beginning
to
expand
the

who

only
now
putting

their
sharply
anthropomorphic
dress
modern
student
who
knows
what
was
to
come
next
is
likely
to
place
first
the
factors
of
change
which
are
visible
in
the
eighth
century
all
men
of
the
period
would
have
accepted
this
emphasis
potters
clung
to
the
past
the
more
determinedly
as
they
were
confronted
with
radically
new
ideas
the
poet
of
the
deliberately
archaized
it
is
not
possible
to
sunder
old
and
new
in
this
era
shall
consider
in
the
present
chapter
primarily
the
first
decades
of
the
eighth
century
and
shall
interpret
them
as
an
apogee
of
the
first
stage
of
civilization
this
principle
of
division
must
postpone
the
evolution
of
sculpture
architecture
society
and
politics
for
the
developments
in
these
areas
make
sense
only
if
they
are
connected
to
the
age
of
revolution
itself
growing
contacts
between
and
are
also
a
phase
which
should
be
linked
primarily
to
the
remarkable
broadening
of
culture
after
shall
not
be
able
entirely
to
pass
over
these
connections
to
the
as
we
consider
pottery
the
epic
and
the
myth
and
the
religious
evolution
of
early
the
important
point
however
is
that
these
magnificent
achievements
unlike
those
of
later
decades
were
only
incidentally
influenced
by
models
antecedents
of
vases
and
of
the
lie
in
the
past
pottery
the
pottery
of
the
first
half
of
the
eighth
century
is
commonly
called
severe
yet
harmonious
vases
of
the
previous
fifty
years
the
style
of
the
late
ninth
century
display
as
firm
a
mastery
of
the
principles
underlying
pottery
but
artists
now
were
ready
to
refine
and
elaborate
their
inheritance
vases
which
resulted
had
different
shapes
far
more
complex
decoration
and
a
larger
sense
of
style
the
aesthetic
and
technical
aspects
of
this
expansion
we
must
consider
the
change
in
pottery
style
on
broader
lines
earlier
centuries
men
had
had
enough
to
do
in
rebuilding
a
fundamental
sense
of
order
after
chaos
had
had
to
work
on
very
simple
foundations
and
had
not
dared
to
give
rein
to
impulses
potters
in
particular
had
virtually
eschewed
freehand
drawing
elaborate
motifs
and
the
curving
lines
of
nature
while
yet
expressing
a
belief
that
there
was
order
in
the
universe
their
vases
were
embodied
the
basic
aesthetic
and
logical
characteristics
of
civilization
at
first
hesitantly
in
work
and
then
more
confidently
in
the
initial
stages
of
the
style
social
and
cultural
security
had
been
achieved
at
least
on
a
simple
plane
it
was
time
to
take
bigger
steps
to
venture
on
experiments
potters
continued
to
employ
the
old
syntax
of
ornaments
and
shapes
and
made
use
of
the
though
limited
range
of
motifs
which
they
had
inherited
these
respects
the
vases
of
the
early
eighth
century
represent
a
culmination
of
earlier
lines
of
progress
the
ancestral
lore
however
new
materials
were
added
left
less
and
less
of
a
vase
in
a
plain
dark
color
instead
they
divided
the
surface
into
many
bands
or
covered
it
by
patterns
into
which
freehand
drawing
began
to
creep
lines
patterns
rosettes
of
indefinitely
floral
nature
birds
either
singly
or
in
stylized
rows
animals
in
solemn
frieze
bands
see
all
these
turned
up
in
the
more
developed
fabrics
as
preliminary
signs
that
the
potters
were
broadening
their
gaze
rows
of
animals
and
birds
in
particular
suggest
awareness
of
animal
friezes
transmitted
perhaps
via
silver
bowls
and
textiles
but
the
specific
forms
of
these
rows
on
local
vases
and
metal
products
are
nonetheless
the
spread
of
this
type
of
decoration
in
the
has
not
yet
been
precisely
determined
it
seems
to
appear
first
in
the
which
were
among
the
leading
exporters
of
pottery
throughout
the
century
the
material
at
the
command
of
the
potters
grew
and
the
volume
of
their
production
increased
the
local
variations
within
a
common
style
became
more
evident

four
examples
which
are

work

spirit

different
schools

his

the
other
fact
that
it
is
described
as
minus
salutaris
quam
festivus
no
less
salutary
than
gay
also
overlooks
the
fact
that
in
a
rational
lexicon
and
quite
clearly
in
lexicon
the
opposite
of
serious
is
not
gay
but
frivolous
and
the
opposite
of
gay
is
not
serious
but
solemn
believed
that
a
man
could
be
both
serious
and
gay
a
writer
who
is
gay
cannot
be
serious
is
a
common
professional
illusion
sedulously
fostered
by
all
too
many
academics
who
mistakenly
believe
that
their
frivolous
efforts
should
be
taken
seriously
because
they
are
expressed
with
that
dreary
solemnity
which
is
the
only
mode
of
expression
their
authors
are
capable
of
to
find
a
learned
diversion
and
a
pleasing
joke
in
account
of
the
stupid
brutalities
of
early
sixteenth
century
wars
of
the
anguish
of
the
poor
and
dispossessed
of
the
insolence
and
cruelty
of
the
rich
and
powerful
requires
a
callousness
toward
suffering
and
sin
that
would
be
surprising
in
a
moral
imbecile
and
most
surprising
in
himself
it
is
even
surprising
in
the
of
and
of
who
fathered
this
most
peculiar
view
and
in
the
brilliant
of
and
at
who
inherited
it
and
is
now
its
most
eminent
proponent
to
return
to
the
main
line
of
our
inquiry
it
is
doubtful
that
is
still
widely
read
because
was
medieval
or
even
because
he
was
a
martyr
indeed
it
is
likely
that
these
days
many
who
read
with
interest
do
not
even
know
that
its
author
was
a
martyr
is
still
widely
read
because
in
a
sense
stood
on
the
margin
of
modernity
if
he
did
stand
on
the
margins
of
modernity
it
was
not
in
dying
a
martyr
for
such
unity
as
supremacy
might
be
able
to
force
on
was
not
even
in
writing
epigrams
sometimes
bawdy
ones
or
in
translating
from
into
or
in
defending
the
study
of
against
the
attack
of
conservative
academics
or
in
attacking
the
conservative
theologians
who
opposed
philological
study
of
the
literary
exercises
were
the
common
doings
of
a
humanist
of
the
first
two
decades
of
the
sixteenth
century
writings
been
wholly
limited
to
such
exercises
they
would
be
almost
as
dimly
remembered
as
those
of
a
dozen
or
so
other
authors
living
in
his
time
whose
works
tenuously
survive
in
the
minds
of
the
few
hundred
scholars
who
each
decade
in
pursuit
of
their
very
specialized
occasions
read
those
works
stands
on
the
margins
of
modernity
for
one
reason
alone
because
he
wrote
the
evidence
that
he
does
indeed
stand
there
derives
quite
simply
from
the
vigorous
interest
with
which
rather
casual
readers
have
responded
to
that
book
for
the
past
century
or
so
one
other
contemporary
of
evokes
so
immediate
and
direct
a
response
and
only
one
other
contemporary
work
and
we
discover
what
it
is
in
that
has
evoked
this
response
that
in
seeking
the
modern
in
we
do
not
deny
the
existence
of
the
medieval
and
the
there
we
do
not
even
need
to
commit
ourselves
to
assessing
on
the
same
inconceivable
scale
the
relative
importance
of
the
medieval
the
and
the
modern
medieval
was
the
most
important
to
because
he
sought
to
place
the
author
of
in
some
intelligible
relation
with
the
martyr
others
whose
concern
it
is
to
penetrate
the
significance
of
the
elements
are
of
primary
concern
here
we
have
a
distinctly
modern
preoccupation
we
want
to
know
why
that
book
has
kept
on
selling
the
way
it
has
we
want
to
know
what
is
perennially
new
about
is
new
about
it
that
question
the
answer
is
simple
it
can
be
made
in
two
words
communism
it
is
an
answer
which
opens
the
door
wide
to
an
onrush
of
objections
and
denials
there
is
nothing
new
about
communism
find
it
in
and
in
acknowledges
his
debt
to
that
book
find
it
in
that
common
way
of
life
pleasing
to
and
still
in
use
among
the
truest
societies
of
that
is
the
better
monasteries
which
made
it
easier
to
convert
the
to
find
it
in
the
later
conception
of
natural
condition
which
included
the
community
of
all
possessions
conception
was
taken
up
by
the
early
and
by
canon
lawyers
and
theologians
in
the
and
was
far
too
well
read
not
to
have
come
across
it
in
one
or
several
of
the
forms
thus
given
it
although
the
idea
of
communism
is
very
old
even
in
day
and
did
not
spring
from
his
imagination
in
it
is
not
communism
as
such
that
we
are
concerned
with
are
concerned
not
with
the
genus
communism
nor
with
other
species
of
the
genus
early
monastic
canonist
or
theological
communism
we
are
concerned
with
communism
that
is
simply
communism
as
it
appears
in
the
imaginary
commonwealth
of
as
conceived
it
one
way
to
sharpen
our
sense
of
the
modernity
of
communism
is
to
contrast
it
with
the
principal
earlier
types
of
communistic
theory
will
achieve
a
more
vivid
sense
of
what
it
is
by
realizing
what
it
is
not
communism
is
to
speak
anachronistically
a
communism
of
function
is
to
separate
from
the
base
ruled
mass
among
whom
private
ownership
prevails
the
governing
warrior
elite
it
is
too
readily
forgotten
that
in
the
what
gave
the
initial
impetus
to
excursus
into
the
construction
of
an
imaginary
commonwealth
with
its
communism
of
goods
wives
and
children
was
his
quest
for
a
canon
for
the
proper
ordering
of
the
individual
human
psyche
and
it
is
to
this
problem
that
the
ultimately
returns
communism
is
not
a
means
of
separating
out
a
warrior
elite
from
the
lumpish
mass
communism
applies
to
all
in
the
economy
of
the
book
it
is
not
peripheral
but
central
concern
of
is
with
the
optimo
reipublicae
statu
the
best
ordering
of
a
civil
society
and
it
is
again
and
again
made
clear
that
communism
provides
the
institutional
array
indispensible
to
that
best
ordering
derive
communism
from
the
community
of
the
apostolic
age
or
from
its
medieval
the
monastic
communities
is
with
an
appropriate
shift
of
adjectives
misleading
in
the
same
way
as
to
derive
it
from
in
the
we
have
to
do
with
an
elite
of
physical
and
intellectual
athletes
in
the
apostolic
and
monastic
communities
with
an
elite
of
spiritual
and
religious
athletes
apostolic
community
was
literally
an
elite
chosen
by
himself
the
monastic
communities
were
supposed
to
be
made
up
of
volunteers
selected
only
after
a
novitiate
which
would
test
their
religious
aptitude
for
monastic
rigors
their
spiritual
athleticism
the
conception
of
the
natural
community
of
all

firmly
fixed
in
a
tradition
by
time
although
it

not
accepted

all

of

communism
lay
a
safe
distance

age
of
innocence
before

not

not

communism

a
new
thing
is
not
merely
a
new
thing
it
is
one
of
the
very
few
new
things
in
most
of
the
rest
is
medieval
or
humanist
or
part
of
an
old
tradition
of
social
criticism
to
say
that
at
a
moment
in
history
something
is
new
is
not
necessarily
to
say
that
it
is
modern
and
for
this
statement
the
best
evidence
comes
within
the
five
years
following
the
publication
of
when
elaborates
a
new
perception
of
the
nature
of
the
encounter
with
man
indeed
is
perception
but
not
modern
as
anyone
knows
who
has
ever
tried
to
make
intelligible
to
modern
students
what
was
getting
at
communism
is
both
new
in
and
also
modern
it
is
not
modern
communism
or
even
modern
socialism
as
they
exist
or
have
ever
existed
in
theory
or
in

the
features
of

generous
public
provision
for
the
infirm
democratic
and
secret

of
all

therefore
no

in
the
economic
sense
of
the
term
the
merits
of
its
intent
communism
is
far
too
naive
far
too
crude
to
suit
any
modern
socialist
or
communist
is
not
the
details
of
communism
that
make
modern
it
is
the
spirit
the
attitude
of
mind
that
informs
those
details
that
spirit
and
attitude
were
we
can
best
understand
if
we
see
more
precisely
how
it
contrasts
with
the
communist
tradition
with
the
longest
continuous
history
the
one
which
reached
by
the
way
of
through
the
of
the
trial
the
press
condemned
the
proceedings
and
heralded
as
a
martyr
to
the
principles
of
the
of
the
trial
however
the
most
powerful
newspaper
the
stated
that
was
a
murderer
a
man
of
blood
and
that
he
and
his
associates
with
the
assistance
of
and
had
plotted
not
only
the
liberation
of
the
slaves
but
also
the
overthrow
of
state
and
federal
governments
answered
the
by
stating
that
the
raid
of
was
characteristic
of
acts
of
violence
and
that
was
acting
in
direct
opposition
to
the
who
proclaim
as
one
of
their
cardinal
principles
that
they
do
not
interfere
with
slavery
in
the
states
two
major
newspapers
in
continued
throughout
the
crisis
to
accuse
each
other
of
misrepresenting
the
facts
and
attempting
to
falsify
history
the
continued
to
accuse
and
the
continued
to
accuse
the
complained
that
the
authorities
showed
indecent
and
cowardly
haste
to
condemn
and
his
men
stated
their
guilt
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
they
are
entitled
to
sufficient
time
to
prepare
for
trial
and
a
fair
trial
thought
that
there
were
probably
good
reasons
for
the
haste
in
which
the
trial
was
being
conducted
and
that
the
only
thing
gained
by
a
delay
would
be
calmer
feelings
stated
that
although
the
guilt
of
was
evident
the
must
guarantee
him
a
fair
trial
to
preserve
domestic
peace
was
found
guilty
of
treason
against
the
state
of
inciting
slave
rebellion
and
murder
these
crimes
he
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
in
public
on
receiving
the
news
writers
editors
and
clergymen
heaped
accusations
of
murder
on
the
states
particularly
were
preparing
for
the
state
elections
they
watched

with
extreme
interest
morning
the
stated
that
although
justly
deserved
the
extreme
penalty
no
man
however
criminal
ought
to
suffer
the
penalty
without
a
fair
trial
main
criticism
of
the
trial
was
the
haste
with
which
it
was
conducted
readers
of
the
however
learned
that
it
was
generally
conceded
that
had
a
fair
trial
the
sentence
the
editor
asked
else
can
do
than
to
hang
the
men
who
have
defied
her
laws
organized
treason
and
butchered
her
citizens
the
eastern
section
of
the
state
the
reaction
to
trial
and
sentence
were
basically
identical
editor
of
the
stated
that
the
ends
of
justice
must
be
satisfied
a
solitary
example
must
be
set
in
order
that
all
those
misnamed
philantropists
who
actuated
by
a
blind
zeal
dare
to
instigate
riot
treason
and
murder
may
heed
it
and
shape
their
future
course
accordingly
editor
of
the
could
discover
no
evidence
of
extenuating
circumstances
in
the
trial
which
would
warrant
making
an
exception
to
the
infliction
of
capital
punishment
direct
contrast
to
the
other
editors
of
the
outwardly
condemned
the
trial
as
being
completely
unfair
the
sentence
wrote
it
be
possible
that
mercy
shall
override
vengeance
and
that
sentence
shall
be
commuted
to

together
a
very
respectable
audience
composed
in
part
of
those
who
had
been
distinguished
for
years
for
their
radical
views
upon
the
subject
of
slavery
of
many
of
our
colored
citizens

been
unanimously
chosen

of
the

spoke
of
his
desire
to
promote
the
abolition
of

by
peaceable
means
and
he

numbers
of

commenced
his
remarks
by
an
allusion
to
the
general
feeling
of
opposition
which
the
meeting
had
encountered
from
many
of
the
citizens
and
all
the
newspapers
of
the
city
said
that
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
such
a
gathering
was
a
question
that
was

in

that
they
are

charge
that
they

traitors
and
upholding
men
whom
the

have
condemned

party
opposed
to
the
condemnation
of

as
a
violation
of
the

principles

liberty
the

preamble
and
resolutions

by
the

on
the
question
of
their
adoption
passed
unanimously
has
cheerfully
risked
his
life
in
endeavoring
to
deliver
those
who
are
denied
all
rights
and
is
this
day
doomed
to
suffer
death
for
his
efforts
in
behalf
of
those
who
have
no
helper
that
while
we
most
decidedly
disapprove
the
methods
he
adopted
to
accomplish
his
objects
yet
in
his
willingness
to
die
in
aid
of
the
great
cause
of
human
freedom
we
still
recognize
the
qualities
of
a
noble
nature
and
the
exercise
of
a
spirit
which
true
men
have
always
admired
and
which
history
never
fails
to
honor
that
his
wrongs
and
bereavements
in
occasioned
by
the
violence
and
brutality
of
those
who
were
intent
on
the
propagation
of
slavery
in
that
territory
call
for
a
charitable
judgment
upon
his
recent
efforts
in
to
undermine
the
despotism
from
which
he
had
suffered
and
commend
his
family
to
the
special
sympathy
and
aid
of
all
who
pity
suffering
and
reverence
justice
that
the
sentiment
is
becoming
ripe
for
resolute
action
that
we
find
in
this
fearful
tragedy
at
a
reason
for
more
earnest
effort
to
remove
the
evil
of
slavery
from
the
whole
land
as
speedily
as
possible
the
morning
following
the
meeting
the
editor
of
the
wrote
that
although
the
meeting
was
milder
and
less
extreme
than
those
held
in
other
areas
for
similar
purposes
it
could
have
been
avoided
completely
than
being
deceived
the
eye
is
puzzled
instead
of
seeing
objects
in
space
it
sees
nothing
more
than
a
picture
and
as
the
tendency
to
adhere
to
the
literal
surface
became
harder
and
harder
to
deny
the
task
of
keeping
the
surface
at
length
fell
all
the
more
to
contrivances
reinforce
and
sometimes
to
replace
the
simulated
typography
and
began
to
mix
sand
and
other
foreign
substances
with
their
paint
the
granular
texture
thus
created
likewise
called
attention
to
the
reality
of
the
surface
and
was
effective
over
much
larger
areas
certain
other
pictures
however
began
to
paint
areas
in
exact
simulation
of
wood
graining
or
marbleizing
areas
by
virtue
of
their
abrupt
density
of
pattern
stated
the
literal
surface
with
such
new
and
superior
force
that
the
resulting
contrast
drove
the
simulated
printing
into
a
depth
from
which
it
could
be
rescued
and
set
to
shuttling
again
only
by
conventional
perspective
that
is
by
being
placed
in
such
relation
to
the
forms
depicted
within
the
illusion
that
these
forms
left
no
room
for
the
typography
except
near
the
surface
accumulation
of
such
devices
however
soon
had
the
effect
of
telescoping
even
while
separating
surface
and
depth
process
of
flattening
seemed
inexorable
and
it
became
necessary
to
emphasize
the
surface
still
further
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
fusing
with
the
illusion
was
for
this
reason
and
no
other
that
can
see
that
in
took
the
radical
and
revolutionary
step
of
pasting
actual
pieces
of
wallpaper
to
a
drawing
on
paper
instead
of
trying
to
simulate
its
texture
in
paint
says
that
he
himself
had
already
made
his
first
collage
toward
the
end
of
when
he
glued
a
piece
of
oilcloth
to
a
painting
on
canvas
is
true
that
his
first
collage
looks
more
than
which
would
confirm
the
date
he
assigns
it
it
is
also
true
that
was
the
consistent
pioneer
in
the
use
of
simulated
textures
as
well
as
of
typography
and
moreover
he
had
already
begun
to
broaden
and
simplify
the
of
as
far
back
as
the
end
of
we
examine
what
each
master
says
was
his
first
collage
we
see
that
much
the
same
thing
happens
in
each
makes
no
real
difference
that
collage
is
on
paper
and
eked
out
in
charcoal
while
is
on
canvas
and
eked
out
in
oil
its
greater
corporeal
presence
and
its
greater
extraneousness
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
serves
for
a
seeming
moment
to
push
everything
else
into
a
more
vivid
idea
of
depth
than
the
simulated
printing
or
simulated
textures
had
ever
done
here
again
the
device
both
overshoots
and
falls
short
of
its
aim
the
illusion
of
depth
created
by
the
contrast
between
the
affixed
material
and
everything
else
gives
way
immediately
to
an
illusion
of
forms
in
which
gives
way
in
turn
and
with
equal
immediacy
to
an
illusion
that
seems
to
contain
both
or
neither
of
the
size
of
the
areas
it
covers
the
pasted
paper
establishes
undepicted
flatness
bodily
as
more
than
an
indication
or
sign
flatness
now
tends
to
assert
itself
as
the
main
event
of
the
picture
and
the
device
boomerangs
the
illusion
of
depth
is
rendered
even
more
precarious
than
before
of
isolating
the
literal
flatness
by
specifying
and
circumscribing
it
the
pasted
paper
or
cloth
releases
and
spreads
it
and
the
artist
seems
to
have
nothing
left
but
this
undepicted
flatness
with
which
to
finish
as
well
as
start
his
picture
actual
surface
becomes
both
ground
and
background
and
it
turns
out
suddenly
and
paradoxically
that
the
only
place
left
for
a
illusion
is
in
front
of
upon
the
surface
their
very
first
collages
and
draw
or
paint
over
and
on
the
affixed
paper
or
cloth
so
that
certain
of
the
principal
features
of
their
subjects
as
depicted
seem
to
thrust
out
into
real
space
or
to
be
about
to
do
so
while
the
rest
of
the
subject
remains
imbedded
in
or
flat
upon
the
surface
the
surface
is
driven
back
in
its
very
surfaceness
only
by
this
contrast
the
upper
center
of
first
collage
in
collection
a
bunch
of
grapes
is
rendered
with
such
conventionally
vivid
sculptural
effect
as
to
lift
it
practically
off
the
picture
plane
illusion
here
is
no
longer
enclosed
between
parallel
flatnesses
but
seems
to
thrust
through
the
surface
of
the
drawing
paper
and
establish
depth
on
top
of
it
the
violent
immediacy
of
the
wallpaper
strips
pasted
to
the
paper
and
the
only
lesser
immediacy
of
block
capitals
that
simulate
window
lettering
manage
somehow
to
push
the
grape
cluster
back
into
place
on
the
picture
plane
so
that
it
does
not
jump
the
same
time
the
wallpaper
strips
themselves
seem
to
be
pushed
into
depth
by
the
lines
and
patches
of
shading
charcoaled
upon
them
and
by
their
placing
in
relation
to
the
block
capitals
and
these
capitals
seem
in
turn
to
be
pushed
back
by
their
placing
and
by
contrast
with
the
corporeality
of
the
woodgraining
every
part
and
plane
of
the
picture
keeps
changing
place
in
relative
depth
with
every
other
part
and
plane
and
it
is
as
if
the
only
stable
relation
left
among
the
different
parts
of
the
picture
is
the
ambivalent
and
ambiguous
one
that
each
has
with
the
surface
the
same
thing
more
or
less
can
be
said
of
the
contents
of
first
collage
later
collages
of
both
masters
a
variety
of
extraneous
materials
are
used
sometimes
in
the
same
work
and
almost
always
in
conjunction
with
every
other
and
device
they
can
think
of
area
adjacent
to
one
edge
of
a
piece
of
affixed
material
or
simply
of
a
form
will
be
shaded
to
pry
that
edge
away
from
the
surface
while
something
will
be
drawn
painted
or
even
pasted
over
another
part
of
the
same
shape
to
drive
it
back
into
depth
defined
as
parallel
to
the
surface
also
cut
through
it
into
real
space
and
a
depth
is
suggested
optically
which
is
greater
than
that
established
pictorially
this
expands
the
oscillation
between
surface
and
depth
so
as
to
encompass
fictive
space
in
front
of
the
surface
as
well
as
behind
it
may
now
monopolize
everything
but
it
is
a
flatness
become
so
ambiguous
and
expanded
as
to
turn
into
illusion
itself
at
least
an
optical
if
not
properly
speaking
a
pictorial
illusion
flatness
is
now
almost
completely
assimilated
to
the
literal
undepicted
kind
but
at
the
same
time
it
reacts
upon
and
largely
transforms
the
undepicted
kind
and
it
does
so
moreover
without
depriving
the
latter
of
its
literalness
rather
it
underpins
and
reinforces
that
literalness
it
of
this
literalness
the
subject
reemerged
it
had
turned
out
by
a
further
paradox
of
that
the
means
to
an
illusion
of
depth
and
plasticity
had
now
become
widely
divergent
from
the
means
of
representation
or
imaging
the
phase
of
their
and
had
not
only
had
to
minimize
simply
in
order
to
preserve
it
they
had
also
had
to
generalize
it
to
the
point
finally
where
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
became
abstracted
from
specific
entities
and
was
rendered
largely
as
the
illusion
of
depth
and
relief
as
such
as
a
disembodied
attribute
and
expropriated
property
detached
from
everything
not
itself
order
to
be
saved
plasticity
had
had
to
be
isolated
and
as
the
aspect
of
the
subject
was
transposed
into
those
clusters
of
more
or
less
interchangeable
and
by
which
plasticity
was
isolated
under
the
method
the
subject
itself
became
largely
unrecognizable
in
its
phase
which
the
with
justice
call
hermetic
was
on
the
verge
of
abstract
art
was
then
that
and
were
confronted
with
a
unique
dilemma
they
had
to
choose
between
illusion
and
representation
they
opted
for
illusion
it
could
only
be
illusion
per
se
an
illusion
of
depth
and
of
relief
so
general
and
abstracted
as
to
exclude
the
representation
of
individual
objects
on
the
other
hand
they
opted
for
representation
it
had
to
be
representation
per
se
representation
as
image
pure
and
simple
without
connotations
at
least
without
more
than
schematic
ones
of
the
space
in
which
the
objects
represented
originally
existed
was
the
collage
that
made
the
terms
of
this
dilemma
clear
the
representational
could
be
restored
and
preserved
only
on
the
flat
and
literal
surface
now
that
illusion
and
representation
had
become
for
the
first
time
mutually
exclusive
alternatives
the
end
and
plumped
for
the
representational
and
it
would
seem
they
did
so
deliberately
provides
whatever
real
justification
there
is
for
the
talk
about
reality
the
inner
formal
logic
of
as
it
worked
itself
out
through
the
collage
had
just
as
much
to
do
with
shaping
their
decision
the
smaller
of
were
placed
upon
or
juxtaposed
with
the
large
dense
shapes
formed
by
the
affixed
materials
of
the
collage
they
had
to
coalesce
become
synthesized
into
larger
planar
shapes
themselves
simply
in
order
to
maintain
the
integrity
of
the
picture
plane
in
their
previous
smallness
they
would
have
cut
away
too
abruptly
into
depth
and
the
broad
opaque
shapes
of
pasted
paper
would
have
been
isolated
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
them
jump
out
of
plane
planes
juxtaposed
with
other
large
planes
tend
to
assert
themselves
as
independent
shapes
and
to
the
extent
that
they
are
flat
they
also
assert
themselves
as
silhouettes
and
independent
silhouettes
are
apt
to
coincide
with
the
recognizable
contours
of
the
subject
from
which
a
picture
starts
if
it
does

is
because
of
the

a

at

not

nor
did
fully
begin
there
when
the

had
been
exhaustively
translated
into

and
transformed
by
this
translation
did
become
an
affair
of
positive

the
point
at
which

finally
took
the

in

away
from
never
again
to
relinquish
it
even
before
that
had

and
entered
for
a
moment
a
certain
revolutionary
path
in
which
no
one
had
preceded

as
though
in
that
instant
he
had
felt
the
flatness
of

as
too
constricting
and
had
suddenly
tried
to
escape
all
the
way
back
or
forward
to
literal

did
by
using
utterly
literal
means
to
carry
the

of
the

of

creating
a

it

as

artificial

appeal
of

particularly
strong
for

movement

is
not

catastrophically
new
as
some

merely
the
latest
example
of
the
leapfrog
growth
which
formed
the
pattern
of
virtually
all

big

which
are
relatively
near
the
centers
of
our
cities
the

at
a
time
when
that
was
the

of
the

close
to
transport
river
storage
piers
and
power
river
leapfrog
was
a
phenomenon
of
the
railroad
and
the

the

when
the

the
old

gave
the

a

he
had
to
be
near
a
railroad
siding
and
a

or
an
existing
large
community
of
homes
railroad
siding
is
still
important
it
is
usually
though
not
always
true
that
shipment
by
rail
is
cheaper
than
trucking
anybody
who
promises
a
substantial
volume
of
business
can
get
a
railroad
to
run
a
short
spur
to
his
plant
these
days
and
many
businesses
can
live
without
the
railroad
there
are
now
many
millions
of
workers
for
whom
the

with
the
big
parking
lot
which
can
be
reached
by
driving
across
or
against
the
usual
pattern
of

and

is
actually
more
convenient
than
the

mostly
well
designed
and
nicely
set
against
the

can
even
be
rather
grand
like
monument
to
the
astonishing
success
of
they
deny
the

of
the

the
crowded
competitive
tolerant
city
the
melting

which
gave
off
so
many
of
the
most
admirable
qualities
are
segregated

combining
again
on
one
site
the
factory
and
the

drawing
their
work
force
from
segregated
communities
is
interesting
to
note
how
many
of
the
plants
on
draw
most
of
their
income
either
from
the
government
in
arrangements
or
from
the
exploitation
of
patents
which
grant
at
least
a
partial
monopoly
the
factories
were
always
the
center
of
the
labor
market
they
were
often
on
the
periphery
spreading
the
factories
even
farther
the
automobile
may
not
have
changed
to
any
great
extent
the
growth
pattern
of
the
cities
the
loss
of
hotel
business
to
the
motel
has
been
relatively
painless
the
demarcation
is
becoming
harder
to
find
every
year
hurts
most
is
the
damage
the
automobile
has
done
to
retailing
especially
in
those
cities
where
public
transit
is
feeble
retailing
of
course
always
spreads
with
the
population
grocery
stores
drugstores
local
haberdasheries
and
dress
shops
candy
stores
and
the
like
whenever
a
major
purchase
was
contemplated
forty
years
ago
a
new
bedroom
set
or
a
winter
coat
an
bonnet
a
bicycle
for
the
family
set
off
for
the
downtown
department
store
where
the
selection
would
be
greatest
stores
congregated
in
the
one
hundred
per
cent
location
where
all
the
transit
lines
converged
stores
are
still
there
but
the
volume
of
the
downtown
store
has
been
on
a
relative
decline
while
in
many
cities
the
suburban
branch
sells
more
and
more
dry
goods
the
retailer
and
downtown
unit
sales
have
been
decreasing
however
his
dollar
volume
continues
to
rise
and
it
is
dollars
which
you
put
in
the
bank
most
discussions
of
this
phenomenon
the
figures
are
substantially
inflated
suburban
branch
not
even
vast
outside
does
anything
like
the
unit
volume
of
business
or
carries
anything
like
the
variety
of
merchandise
to
be
found
in
the
home
store
orders
distort
the
picture
the
suburbanite
naturally
calls
a
local
rather
than
a
number
if
both
are
listed
in
an
advertisement
especially
if
the
local
call
eliminates
city
sales
tax
suburban
branch
is
thereby
credited
with
a
sale
which
would
have
been
made
even
if
its
glass
doors
had
never
opened
procedures
which
continue
to
charge
a
disproportionate
overhead
and
warehouse
expense
to
the
main
store
make
the
branches
seem
more
profitable
than
they
are
many
cases
that
statement
break
even
on
our
downtown
operation
and
make
money
on
our
branches
would
be
turned
around
if
the
cost
analysis
were
recalculated
on
terms
less
prejudicial
to
the
old
store
of
the
competition
always
a
great
motivating
force
in
the
economy
makes
retailers
who
do
not
have
suburban
operations
exaggerate
both
the
volume
and
the
profitability
of
their
shiny
new
branches
fact
seems
to
be
that
very
many
large
branch
stores
are
uneconomical
that
the
choice
of
location
in
the
suburbs
is
as
important
as
it
was
downtown
and
that
even
highly
suburbanized
cities
will
support
only
so
many
big
branches
the
cost
of
operations
is
always
high
in
any
new
store
as
the
conservative
bankers
who
act
as
controllers
for
retail
giants
are
beginning
to
discover
all
has
been
said
however
the
big
branch
store
remains
a
major
break
with
history
in
the
development
of
retailing
as
the
suburban
factory
may
be
more
convenient
than
the
downtown
plant
to
the
worker
with
a
car
the
trip
to
the
shopping
center
may
seem
far
easier
than
to
the
downtown
department
store
though
both
are
the
same
distance
from
home
there
are
some
cities
where
the
suburban
shopping
pulls
customers
who
are
geographically
much
nearer
to
downtown
reports
that
residents
of
have
been
driving
across
the
through
the
heart
of
downtown
and
out
to
the
western
suburbs
for
major
shopping
simply
because
parking
is
easier
at
the
big
branches
than
it
is
in
the
heart
of
town
the
extent
that
the
problem
is
merely
parking
an
aggressive
downtown
management
like
that
of
in
can
fight
back
successfully
by
building
a
garage
on
the
lot
next
door
the
distant
patron
of
the
suburban
branch
has
been
frightened
away
from
downtown
by
traffic
problems
however
the
city
store
can
only
pressure
the
politicians
to
do
something
about
the
highways
or
await
the
completion
of
the
federal
highway
program
if
the
affection
for
the
suburban
branch
reflects
a
desire
to
shop
with
nice
people
rather
than
with
the
indiscriminate
urban
mass
which
supports
the
downtown
department
store
the
central
location
may
be
in
serious
trouble
according
to
land
economist
shopping
centers
and
their
associated
parking
lots
cover
some
acres
of
land
which
is
almost
exactly
the
total
land
area
in
all
the
put
together
downtown
store
continues
to
offer
the
great
inducement
of
variety
both
within
its
gates
and
across
the
street
where
other
department
stores
are
immediately
convenient
for
the
shopper
who
wants
to
see
what
is
available
before
making
up
her
mind
anything
may
be
predicted
in
the
quicksilver
world
of
retailing
it
seems
likely
that
the
suburban
branch
will
come
to
dominate
clothing
taking
the
kid
downtown
is
too
much
of
a
production
household
gadgetry
and
the
discount
business
in
items
stores
were
built
on
dry
goods
especially
fashions
and
in
this
area
in
the
long
run
the
suburban
branches
will
be
hard
put
to
compete
against
downtown
this
analysis
is
correct
the
suburban
branches
will
turn
out
to
be
what
cost
accountants
refuse
to
acknowledge
marginal
operations
rather
than
major
factors
in
the
appeal
of
cities
has
been
their
color
and
life
the
variety
of
experience
they
offered
ya
gonna
keep
down
on
the
farm
a
question
that
had
to
be
asked
long
before
they
saw
usually
lived
in
groups
segregated
by
national
origin
or
religious
belief
they
liked
to
work
and
shop
in
the
noise
and
vitality
of
downtown
a
radical
change
in
the
nature
of
the
population
in
the
central
city
would
be
likely
to
destroy
this
preference
and
we
must
now
turn
our
attention
to
the
question
of
whether
such
a
change
gloomily
foreseen
by
so
many
urban
diagnosticians
is
actually
upon
us
and
their
book
and
argue
that
was
what
made
the
modern
suburb
a
possibility
a
fine
ironical
argument
when
you
consider
how
suburbanites
tend
to
vote

ordinary

to
build
their
own
homes
who
had
been
reluctant
to
lend
without
better
security
than
the

itself
got
that
security
from
the
government
householders
who
had
been
unable
to
pick
up
the
burden
of

found
they
could
borrow
for
years
at

under

losing

in

we
were
able
to
decide
on
some
amplification

well
as

of

were
traced
on
the

large
samples
painted
in

then
left
two
months
to
dry
out
to
their
final
key
it
was
gratifying
to
note
that
they
had
set
so
solidly
as
to
be
hard
to
remove
when
the
time
came

the

of
the

in
good
order
though
the
roughish
sandy
surface
was
thick
with
dust
they
came
out
surprisingly
clear
and
bright
could
be
seen
that
both
artists
used
a
very
thick
final
coat
of
plaster
one
half
inch
and
that
both
followed
the
traditional
fresco
technique
as
described
by
in
the
and
current
in
to
this
day
is
they
used
opaque
color
throughout

much
in
evidence

much
of
the

with
a
dark

so
rich

to

our
own
practice
to
have
the
last
intonaco
plaster
coat
thick
enough
to
match
and
at
the
same
time
to
avoid
fine
cracks
in
drying
we
found
that
it
had
to
be
put
on
in
two
layers

the
first

slaked
several
months
for
us
but
to
make
it
stiffer
of
a
really
consistency
to
avoid
cracking
we
added
a
little
hydrated
lime
hard
on
the
hands
but
we
could
see
no
other
disadvantage
am
told
that
a
mortar
longer
slaked
might
have
remained
longer
in
condition
for
painting
it
was
it
took
the
pigment
well
for
six
hours
enough
for
our
purpose
and
held
it
firmly
in
setting
was
obvious
that
to
match
white
must
be
mixed
with
all
but
the
darkest
tones
white
hard
and
brilliant
has
a
tendency
to
jump
away
from
the
other
colors
in
drying
and
also
by
its
capacity
to
set
to
preclude
the
use
of
gradations

mostly

some
burnt

a
little
yellow

was
probably
not
in

was
needed
to
take
the

off

the

softening
effects
of

were
seen
even
after

tried
to

however
that

coveting
a
bit

could

be
settled
by
comparing
the
measurement
of
the
actual

the
dimensions

doubtful

with

when

was

whom
wish
to
address
with
this
letter
are
for
the
most
part
unknown
to
me
may
well
be
that
when
and
visited
your
country
last
spring
you
were
living
and
working
close
to
the
places
we
saw
and
the
streets
we
walked
artists
it
was
natural
that
we
would
want
to
meet
as
many
artists
as
possible
letter
might
not
have
been
necessary
had
our
efforts
to
meet
and
talk
with
you
been
more
successful
though
we
did
not
see
many
of
your
faces
it
appears
now
quite
evident
that
a
considerable
number
of
your
profession
heard
from
those
whom
we
had
the
fortune
to
encounter
that
we
had
been
in
your
midst
am
very
pleased
that
quite
a
number
of
you
found
ways
to
communicate
to
me
your
desire
to
hear
of
our
reactions
and
experiences
in
the
can
well
understand
your
curiosity
ourselves
are
always
eager
to
know
how
others
feel
about
us
and
the
way
in
which
we
live
is
my
hope
that
this
written
message
and
report
will
reach
you
through
the
good
offices
of
the
of
should
be
no
reason
to
misinterpret
or
ignore
the
intent
of
this
letter
and
endeavored
earnestly
to
record
our
impressions
without
the
prejudice
that
the
anxiety
of
our
time
so
easily
provokes
of
little
more
than
a
month
cannot
entitle
me
to
pose
as
an
expert
on
anything
saw
much
damage
is
done
by
experts
who
have
spent
even
less
time
if
any
at
all
in
the
consider
it
reasonable
because
of
my
commitment
as
an
artist
to
assume
that
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
creative
individuals
are
related
to
humanity
as
a
whole
rather
than
to
specific
interests
this
attitude
is
seriously
questioned
in
the
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
majority
of
the
society
in
which
live
is
too
aware
of
the
necessity
for
clarity
on
this
ethical
as
well
as
aesthetic
point
of
view
is
a
matter
of
some
disappointment
to
me
that
still
many
of
my
own
countrymen
are
too
shortsighted
to
ascribe
any
symbolic
significance
to
the
plight
of
a
minority
such
as
artists
in
any
social
order
encountered
many
questions
and
great
interest
upon
my
return
from
the
about
my
reactions
to
that
experience
which
found
most
profound
and
most
disturbing
appeared
to
evoke
a
curiously
muted
reaction
as
if
were
talking
about
something
quite
unreal
this
is
not
the
time
and
the
climate
in
which
people
will
listen
objectively
or
at
least
dispassionately
to
individual
impressions
of
a
subject
which
preoccupies
a
good
deal
of
their
waking
moments
predispositions
tend
to
blunt
the
ear
and
in
turn
the
voice
as
well
cannot
be
content
with
the
anecdotal
small
talk
of
a
somewhat
unusual
travelogue
am
equally
impatient
with
the
shrug
of
the
shoulder
shake
of
the
head
of
those
who
no
longer
care
because
they
have
known
it
for
so
long
the
aggressive
disbelief
of
those
who
are
romantically
lost
in
a
semantic
jungle
of
the
word
the
belligerent
denunciations
by
the
sick
fanatics
of
ignorance
who
try
to
build
a
wall
of
on
our
physical
horizons
as
it
may
have
been
at
times
and
saw
enough
talked
to
enough
artists
historians
and
others
to
realize
that
the
issue
is
quite
clear
and
poets
are
the
raw
of
humanity
they
are
small
in
number
and
their
contribution
is
not
immediately
decisive
in
everyday
life
themselves
they
may
not
be
able
to
save
the
life
on
this
planet
but
without
them
there
would
be
very
little
left
worth
saving
cannot
be
said
that
our
very
first
day
in
the
turned
out
to
be
an
ordinary
one
that
cold
but
bright
day
we
were
guests
of
your
government
in
the
reviewing
stand
of
to
witness
the
celebration
for
and
later
on
that
day
we
attended
the
somewhat
more
exclusive
reception
for
him
in
one
of
the
impressive
palaces
of
the
we
thus
spent
our
very
first
day
in
the
midst
of
a
large
number
of
your
people
honoring
a
new
hero
and
a
great
national
achievement
our
last
day
to
us
at
least
was
equally
impressive
and
very
moving
even
though
the
crowds
were
absent
and
there
was
almost
complete
silence
stood
under
a
gigantic
tree
in
the
rolling
country
just
outside
of
looking
at
silent
flowers
on
the
grave
of
a
poet
and
writer
who
cherished
the
love
for
his
country
to
the
point
of
foregoing
the
highest
international
honor
grave
about
between
his
home
and
the
blue
turrets
of
a
small
church
rose
above
the
forms
and
spaces
of
gently
undisciplined
pastures
of
green
the
sounds
of
birds
the
silence
of
other
graves
and
the
casual
paths
through
small
forests
yesterday
we
had
met
and
talked
with
a
living
writer
a
contemporary
of
the
dead
poet
who
is
known
for
his
ability
of
manipulating
his
ideas
and
his
craft
more
advantageously
today
we
were
aware
of
only
two
men
had
taken
a
flight
into
uncharted
space
in
the
service
of
science
to
return
as
a
living
hero
other
had
assumed
the
right
to
explore
the
equally
uncharted
space
of
the
human
spirit
flowers
on
his
grave
attested
to
the
fact
that
he
as
well
was
hero
two
recollections
form
the
frame
around
a
series
of
experiences
and
sights
which
to
me
at
least
symbolize
the
extremes
in
the
aesthetic
as
well
as
ethical
conflict
between
materialism
and
humanism
struggle
that
is
being
waged
all
over
the
world
in
the
of
disinterest
prevalent
opinion
which
we
encountered
in
a
variety
of
expressions
in
your
country
denied
not
only
the
existence
of
this
conflict
but
it
was
elaborated
even
further
with
an
incredible
semantic
dexterity
socialist
environment
it
was
stated
had
these
two
extreme
seeds
and
was
about
to
produce
a
new
plant
and
fruit
speculated
on
one
such
occasion
that
the
new
growth
like
other
mutations
might
be
unable
to
propagate
was
immediately
accused
of
preaching
racial
prejudice
could
not
bring
myself
to
answer
that
some
of
my
best
friends
are
mules
kind
of
reasoning
and
logic
takes
a
little
time
to
get
used
to
a
while
we
were
perhaps
less
surprised
but
still
puzzled
when
a
friendly
discussion
would
suddenly
jump
the
track
into
the
most
irrelevant
and
illogical
comparisons
chance
remark
about
sealed
train
brought
the
rejoinder
that
this
was
a
myth
akin
to
cherry
tree
of
the
behavior
pattern
of
population
masses
were
compared
to
scientific
discoveries
concerning
the
of
gaseous
masses
wonder
that
and
had
at
times
difficulty
in
remembering
the
real
purpose
of
our
presence
namely
of
such
an
experience
was
the
occasion
of
a
somewhat
formal
official
welcome
in
the
offices
of
the
of
had
looked
forward
to
what
we
hoped
to
be
our
first
informal
meeting
with
a
number
of
artists
we
became
involved
in
a
series
of
friendly
but
overly
formal
welcoming
addresses
to
which
we
had
no
choice
but
to
reply
in
kind
terms
of
friendship
understanding
cooperation
tend
to
become
somewhat
shopworn
because
of
constant
and
indiscriminate
use
can
only
hope
that
the
continuing
exchange
of
groups
and
individuals
between
our
countries
will
not
wear
out
all
language
pertinent
to
the
occasion
presiding
female
functionary
of
massive
proportions
and
forbidding
appearance
initially
did
not
contribute
to
the
expressions
of
friendship
and
welcome
by
a
number
of
dignified
gentlemen
representing
the
arts
was
only
after
we
had
responded
with
what
fear
were
similar
cliches
that
she
went
into
action
by
questioning
our
desire
for
friendship
and
understanding
with
a
challenge
about
aggressive
and
warlike
actions
by
the
in
and
retreated
by
leaving
the
room
when
we
suggested
that
our
meeting
might
well
terminate
right
then
and
there
she
returned
later
just
as
had
taken
advantage
of
the
friendlier
atmosphere
in
the
room
by
stating
that
perhaps
an
unexpected
result
of
the
would
be
the
of
in
with
regaining
dominance
in
the

her
an
opportunity
to
ring
down
the
curtain
with
the
petulant
admonition
that
we
should
not
presume
to
lecture
her
on
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
as
was
done
on
other
occasions
that
as
well
as
were
a
invention
that
had
been
discarded
as
unwanted
by
the
people
of
the
and
could
not
know
then
that
we
would
experience
this
sort
of
treatment
more
often
in
than
elsewhere
were
to
discover
in
fact
that
quite
a
number
of
people
share
with
us
the
impression
that
in
contrast
to
other
regions
atmosphere
is
depressingly
subdued
and
official
have
intentions
deliberately
or
unintentionally
misunderstood
is
always
a
waste
of
time
our
experience
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
prepare
any
argument
formally
or
informally
simply
do
not
talk
to
each
other
in
that
fashion
and
furthermore
could
not
presume
the
implication
that
spoke
for
artists
as
a
group
save
time
some
clarification
seemed
necessary
following
is
a
statement
read
to
a
large
and
friendly
group
of
your
fellow
artists
in
have
come
to
your
land
with
the
express
intention
of
understanding
and
respecting
your
ideas
and
your
ways
presence
here
should
also
be
considered
further
sincere
evidence
of
the
attempts
by
our
people
and
their
chosen
government
to
seek
any
and
all
possible
ways
to
effect
closer
peaceful
ties
among
all
people
are
quite
convinced
that
one
of
the
main
hopes
for
the
future
depends
upon
the
informal
contacts
and
exchanges
of
ideas
between
individuals
spite
of
the
relatively
short
period
of
time
that
we
have
experienced
among
you
we
have
already
seen
many
indications
of
your
character
and
spirit
are
acutely
aware
that
yours
is
a
society
which
in
spite
of
several
wars
and
many
privations
has
developed
itself
into
one
of
the
foremost
nations
of
the
world
past
history
is
resplendent
with
the
fruits
of
the
intellect
present
history
is
equally
admirable
for
its
industrial
and
scientific
achievements
have
come
to
you
to
experience
something
of
your
way
of
life
while
also
attempting
to
acquaint
you
with
that
of
ours
we
as
artists
believe
deeply
in
the
universal
character
of
all
intellectual
activity
we
would
be
less
than
honest
with
you
or
ourselves
if
we
failed
to
state
a
specific
attitude
toward
our
own
society
as
well
as
the
international
community
as
a
whole
stating
this
position
we
should
like
to
make
it
clear
to
you
that
we
cannot
expect
artists
and
intellectuals
in
other
lands
to
share
our
opinion
in
every
respect
a
matter
of
fact
we
prize
the
diversity
among
our
own
people
so
much
that
we
will
not
presume
to
speak
for
all
other
artists
certainly
all
will
agree
that
it
is
not
so
much
the
knowledge
and
search
for
similarities
between
you
and
us
but
rather
the
thoughtful
exploration
and
acceptance
of
our
differences
which
may
lead
us
to
our
respective
and
desired
goals
with
a
minimum
of
misunderstanding
yourselves
we
have
pride
and
love
for
our
country
many
of
us
this
is
a
land
to
which
we
or
our
parents
fled
from
totalitarian
terror
in
order
to
live
in
dignified
freedom
artists
we
feel
the
same
obligation
as
do
other
individuals
in
considering
ourselves
responsible
citizens
of
a
great
nation
is
an
ambitious
work
scope
is
as
broad
as
the
question
does
it
mean
to
live
in
modern
society
work
so
broad
even
when
it
is
directed
by
a
leading
idea
and
informed
by
a
moral
vision
must
necessarily
fail
a
hasty
reader
will
easily
find
in
it
numerous
blind
spots
errors
of
fact
and
argument
important
exclusions
areas
of
ignorance
and
prejudice
undue
emphases
on
trivia
examples
of
broad
positions
supported
by
flimsy
evidence
and
the
like
books
are
easy
prey
for
critics
need
the
critic
be
captious
careful
and
orderly
man
who
values
precision
and
a
kind
of
tough
intellectual
responsibility
might
easily
be
put
off
by
such
a
book
is
a
simple
matter
for
one
so
disposed
to
take
a
work
like
and
shred
it
into
odds
and
ends
thing
can
be
made
to
look
like
the
cluttered
attic
of
a
large
and
vigorous
family
a
motley
jumble
of
discarded
objects
some
outworn
and
some
that
were
never
useful
some
once
whole
and
bright
but
now
chipped
and
tarnished
some
odd
pieces
whose
history
no
one
remembers
here
and
there
a
gem
everything
fascinating
because
it
suggests
some
part
of
the
human
condition
the
whole
adding
up
to
nothing
more
than
a
glimpse
into
the
disorderly
history
of
the
makers
and
users
could
be
easily
done
but
there
is
little
reason
in
it
would
come
down
to
saying
that
paints
with
a
broad
brush
and
that
after
all
is
not
a
conclusion
one
must
work
toward
but
an
impression
he
has
from
the
outset
mention
these
features
of
the
book
because
they
are
inherent
in
the
character
and
therefore
must
be
mentioned
would
be
superfluous
to
build
a
critique
around
them
are
more
substantial
criticisms
to
be
made
of
account
of
capitalist
civilization
is
worthwhile
to
recall
that
treatment
has
both
descriptive
and
normative
aspects
have
already
discussed
his
moral
position
that
discussion
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
following
pages
which
will
focus
on
the
empirical
and
analytic
side
of
treatment
shall
first
indicate
a
couple
of
weaknesses
in
analysis
then
argue
that
granted
these
weaknesses
he
still
has
much
left
that
is
valuable
and
finally
raise
the
general
question
of
a
philosophical
versus
a
sociological
approach
to
the
question
of
alienation
no
empirical
work
has
been
done
on
the
problem
of
alienation
its
rather
long
intellectual
history
alienation
is
still
a
promising
hypothesis
and
not
a
verified
theory
idea
has
received
much
attention
in
philosophy
in
literature
and
in
a
few
works
of
general
social
criticism
such
as
is
missing
is
work
that
would
answer
presumably
by
the
use
of
survey
methods
and
attitude
scales
such
questions
as
these
are
the
components
of
the
described
as
alienation
widespread
is
alienation
is
its
incidence
among
the
various
classes
and
subgroups
of
the
population
alienation
as
a
dependent
variable
with
what
factors
is
it
most
highly
associated
as
an
independent
variable
how
does
it
affect
behavior
in
various
sectors
of
life
such
work
is
done
there
must
remain
the
nagging
suspicion
that
alienation
may
be
little
more
than
an
expression
of
the
malaise
of
the
intellectual
who
rejected
by
and
in
turn
rejecting
the
larger
society
projects
his
own
fear
and
despair
onto
the
broader
social
screen
am
not
suggesting
that
ought
to
do
this
kind
of
work
do
think
that
alienation
is
nothing
more
than
a
projection
of
the
malaise
of
the
intellectual
am
saying
only
that
until
a
fuller
and
different
kind
of
evidence
comes
in
any
discussion
of
alienation
must
be
understood
to
have
certain
important
limitations
such
evidence
appears
we
must
make
do
with
the
evidence
we
have
perhaps
is
vulnerable
for
he
does
not
always
use
the
best
and
most
recent
evidence
available
and
he
sometimes
selects
and
interprets
the
evidence
in
rather
special
ways
examples
follow
analysis
of
alienation
in
the
sphere
of
production
centers
around
the
concepts
of
the
bureaucratization
of
the
corporation
the
separation
of
ownership
from
control
and
the
broad
and
thus
from
the
point
of
view
of
corporate
control
ineffective
dispersion
of
stock
ownership
all
these
points
he
relies
exclusively
on
and
study
of
broad
conclusions
of
that
pioneering
work
remain
undisturbed
but
subsequent
research
has
expanded
and
somewhat
altered
their
empirical
support
has
suggested
important
revisions
in
the
general
analytic
frame
of
reference
and
has
sharpened
the
meaning
of
particular
analytic
concepts
in
this
area
seems
unaware
of
these
developments
example
is
his
very
infrequent
use
of
the
large
amount
of
data
from
surveys
designed
to
discover
what
and
how
people
actually
do
feel
and
think
on
a
broad
range
of
topics
he
cites
such
findings
just
three
times
the
conclusions
he
draws
from
the
findings
are
not
always
the
only
ones
possible
example
he
cites
the
following
data
from
two
studies
on
job
satisfaction
in
the
first
study
per
cent
of
professionals
and
executives
per
cent
of
white
collar
people
and
per
cent
of
factory
workers
expressed
satisfaction
with
their
jobs
in
the
second
study
the
percentages
were
for
professionals
for
managerial
persons
for
commercial
employees
for
skilled
workers
and
for
workers
concludes
that
these
data
show
a
remarkably
high
percentage
of
consciously
dissatisfied
and
unhappy
persons
among
factory
and
clerical
workers
from
other
value
premises
than
some
analysts
might
conclude
that
the
percentages
really
tell
us
very
little
at
all
while
others
might
even
conclude
that
the
figures
are
remarkably
low
for
example
once
said
that
was
a
paradise
the
only
one
in
the
history
of
the
world
for
workingmen
and
small
children
matters
is
that
while
reading
of
the
data
is
not
the
only
one
possible
it
is
precisely
the
one
we
would
expect
from
a
writer
who
earnestly
believes
that
every
man
can
and
ought
to
be
happy
and
satisfied
also
cites
a
poll
on
attitudes
toward
work
restriction
conducted
by
the
in
in
which
per
cent
of
manual
workers
said
a
man
ought
to
turn
out
as
much
as
he
could
in
a
work
while
per
cent
said
he
should
not
do
his
best
but
should
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
says
these
data
show
that
job
dissatisfaction
and
resentment
are
widespread
is
one
way
to
read
the
findings
but
again
there
are
other
ways
might
use
such
findings
to
indicate
the
strength
of
informal
primary
associations
in
the
factory
an
interpretation
which
would
run
counter
to
theory
of
alienation
he
might
remind
that
the
per
cent
figure
is
really
astonishingly
low
after
all
the
medieval
guild
system
was
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
per
cent
of
the
workers
ought
to
turn
out
only
the
average
amount
and
trade
unions
announce
pretty
much
the
same
view
view
of
these
shortcomings
in
both
the
amount
and
the
interpretation
of
findings
on
public
opinion
and
considering
the
criticisms
which
can
be
brought
against
philosophical
anthropology
such
a
passage
as
the
following
cannot
be
taken
seriously
people
happy
are
they
as
satisfied
unconsciously
as
they
believe
themselves
to
be
the
nature
of
man
and
the
conditions
for
happiness
this
can
hardly
be
so
ambiguities
suggested
above
stem
from
a
more
basic
difficulty
in
style
of
thought
seems
to
use
the
term
alienation
in
two
different
ways
he
uses
it
as
a
subjective
descriptive
term
and
sometimes
as
an
objective
diagnostic
one
is
sometimes
it
is
used
to
describe
felt
human
misery
and
other
times
it
is
postulated
to
explain
unfelt
anxiety
and
discontent
failure
to
keep
these
two
usages
distinct
presents
hazards
to
the
reader
also
permits
to
do
some
dubious
things
with
empirical
findings
alienation
is
used
as
an
objective
and
diagnostic
category
for
example
it
becomes
clear
that
would
have
to
say
that
awareness
of
alienation
goes
far
toward
conquering
it
in
effect
does
say
this
in
his
discussion
of
the
of
the
automaton
conformist
from
this
and
accepting
his
estimate
of
the
iniquities
of
modern
society
it
would
follow
that
the
really
disturbing
evidence
of
alienation
would
be
that
of
a
survey
which
reported
widespread
stated
worker
satisfaction
rather
than
widespread
stated
worker
dissatisfaction
point
is
that
in
a
system
such
as
which
recognizes
unconscious
motivations
and
which
rests
on
certain
ethical
absolutes
empirical
data
can
be
used
to
support
whatever
proposition
the
writer
is
urging
at
the
moment
in
the
example
cited
above
rests
his
whole
case
on
the
premise
that
the
workers
are
being
deprived
unconsciously
unknowingly
of
fulfillment
and
then
supports
this
with
survey
data
reporting
conscious
experienced
frustrations
has
his
cake
and
eats
it
too
if
the
workers
say
they
are
dissatisfied
this
shows
conscious
alienation
if
they
say
they
are
satisfied
this
shows
unconscious
alienation
sort
of
manipulation
is
especially
troublesome
in
work
because
although
his
system
is
derived
largely
from
certain
philosophic
convictions
he
asserts
that
it
is
based
on
empirical
findings
drawn
both
from
social
science
and
from
his
own
consulting
room
the
empirical
psychoanalytic
label
which
claims
sheds
no
light
on
the
validity
of
his
underlying
philosophy
it
does
increase
the
marketability
of
his
product
final
example
of
the
failure
to
use
available
evidence
though
evidence
of
a
different
kind
from
that
which
has
so
far
been
considered
comes
from
treatment
of
some
other
writers
who
have
dealt
with
the
same
themes
a
brief
chapter
dealing
with
he
quotes
isolated
passages
from
some
writers
whose
views
seem
to
corroborate
his
own
and
finds
it
most
remarkable
that
a
critical
view
of
society
was
already
held
by
a
number
of
thinkers
living
in
the
nineteenth
finds
it
equally
remarkable
that
their
critical
diagnosis
and
prognosis
should
have
so
much
in
common
among
themselves
and
with
the
critics
of
the
twentieth
century
is
nothing
remarkable
about
this
at
all
is
largely
a
matter
of
finding
passages
that
suit
purposes
is
a
difference
between
evidence
and
illustration
and
citation
of
the
other
diagnosticians
fits
the
latter
category
at
the
list
and
is
a
delightfully
motley
collection
can
make
them
say
the
same
thing
only
by
not
listening
to
them
very
carefully
and
hearing
only
what
one
wants
to
hear
method
of
selection
uses
achieves
exactly
that
the
list
is
interesting
for
its
omissions
omits
for
example
practically
the
whole
line
of
great
nineteenth
century
social
critics
nearly
all
the
great
writers
whose
basic
position
is
religious
and
all
those
who
are
with
more
or
less
accuracy
called
course
the
list
also
excludes
all
writers
who
are
fairly
optimistic
about
the
modern
situation
these
almost
by
definition
are
spokesmen
for
an
alienated
ideology
is
not
hard
to
find
that
concurrence
of
opinion
which
finds
so
remarkable
when
you
ignore
all
who
hold
a
different
opinion
from
these
problems
of
the
use
of
evidence
one
meets
another
type
of
difficulty
in
analysis
which
is
his
loose
and
ambiguous
use
of
certain
important
terms
such
instance
has
already
been
presented
his
use
of
alienation
only
other
one
shall
mention
here
is
his
use
of
the
term
capitalism
capitalism
is
the
enemy
the
root
of
all
evil
is
of
course
useful
to
have
a
sovereign
cause
on
social
criticism
for
it
makes
diagnosis
and
prescription
much
easier
than
they
might
otherwise
be
one
characteristic
distinguishes
it
is
the
consistency
with
which
every
person
on
the
stage
including
the
chorus
comes
alive
in
the
music
of
this
lifelike
quality
results
from
care
in
basing
his
vocal
line
on
natural
speech
inflections
this
he
followed
a
path
that
led
back
to
the
very
source
of
opera
such
composers
as
and
with
the
same
goal
in
mind
had
developed
styles
of
recitative
sensitively
attuned
to
their
own
languages
long
experimentation
in
his
songs
developed
a
recitative
as
different
from
others
as
the
language
itself
most
of
his
musical
continuity
to
the
orchestra
he
lets
the
speech
fall
into
place
as
if
by
coincidence
but
controlling
the
pace
and
emphasis
of
the
words
moments
of
sung
melody
in
the
usual
sense
come
most
often
when
the
character
is
actually
supposed
to
be
singing
as
in
folk
songs
and
liturgical
chants
reserves
his
vocal
melodies
for
prolonged
expressions
of
emotion
first
monologue
for
example
then
the
flexibility
of
the
phrasing
suggests
that
the
word
comes
first
in
importance
from
himself
one
need
but
examine
the
secondary
roles
to
place
among
the
masters
of
musical
portraiture
those
who
appear
in
only
one
or
two
scenes
are
full
personalities
defined
with
economical
precision
the
four
monks
who
figure
prominently
in
the
action
and
the
no
circumstances
could
we
mistake
one
for
the
other
each
musical
setting
has
an
individual
touch
is
an
old
man
weak
in
body
his
voice
rarely
rises
to
a
full
forte
but
firm
and
clear
of
mind
calmness
offers
contrast
to
youthful
excitement
quiet
but
sturdy
theme
somewhat
folklike
in
character
appears
whenever
the
old
monk
speaks
of
the
history
he
is
recording
or
of
his
own
past
life
theme
comes
to
represent
the
outer
world
the
realm
of
battles
and
banquets
seen
from
a
distance
quite
distinct
from
the
quieter
spiritual
life
in
the
monastery
changes
and
develops
according
to
the
text
it
introduces
when
he
comes
before
in
the
last
act
he
has
been
identified
however
a
new
melody
is
used
to
accompany
his
narrative
a
bleak
motif
with
barren
octaves
creating
a
rather
ancient
effect
imaginative
storyteller
takes
on
the
character
he
describes
as
if
he
were
experiencing
the
old
blindness
and
miraculous
cure
the
composer
uses
a
favorite
device
of
his
the
intensification
of
the
mood
through
key
relationships
original
minor
seems
to
symbolize
blindness
inescapable
in
spite
of
all
attempts
to
move
away
from
it
the
child
addresses
the
shepherd
in
a
dream
light
in
the
form
of
the
major
mode
begins
to
appear
and
at
the
moment
of
the
miracle
we
hear
a
clear
and
shining
major
and
always
appear
together
and
often
sing
together
in
a
straightforward
rhythmically
vigorous
idiom
that
distinguishes
them
from
the
more
subtle
and
begging
song
might
easily
be
a
folk
melody
same
could
be
said
for
the
song
to
which
they
make
their
entrance
in
the
final
scene
their
origin
is
humble
their
approach
to
life
direct
and
unsophisticated
learning
they
may
have
had
in
their
order
disturb
them
now
is
the
straight
man
not
very
talkative
when
he
does
speak
is
loud
rowdy
uninhibited
in
his
pleasures
and
impatient
with
anyone
who
is
not
the
same
rough
ostinato
figure
heard
first
in
the
introduction
to
the
inn
scene
characterizes
him
amusingly
and
reappears
whenever
he
comes
into
the
action
in
which
this
figure
becomes
a
accompaniment
fills
in
the
picture
of
undisciplined
high
spirits
phrasing
is
irregular
and
the
abrupt
key
changes
have
a
primitive
forcefulness
can
imagine
how
they
startled
audiences
of
the
music
begins
to
ramble
as
he
feels
the
effects
of
the
wine
but
he
pulls
himself
together
when
the
need
arises
monks
respond
to
the
challenge
with
a
few
phrases
of
their
begging
song
a
clever
naturalistic
touch
is
labored
reading
of
the
warrant
the
knack
gradually
comes
back
to
him
his
rhythm
becomes
steadier
with
the
rigid
monotony
of
an
unskilled
reader
the
only
time
in
the
opera
words
are
not
set
according
to
their
natural
inflection
to
do
so
would
have
spoiled
the
dramatic
point
of
the
scene
and
dramatically
is
as
far
removed
from
the
conventional
monk
as
music
shows
a
sensuality
coupled
with
an
eerie
quality
that
suggest
somehow
a
with
in
speech
shows
none
of
the
native
accent
of
the
characters
in
spite
of
the
name
he
sounds
personality
appears
more
striking
by
contrast
with
who
is
perhaps
purposely
rather
superficially
characterized
first
entrance
is
a
musical
shock
a
sudden
open
fifth
in
a
key
totally
unrelated
to
what
has
preceded
it
effect
is
as
if
he
had
materialized
out
of
nowhere
speaks
quietly
concealing
his
authority
beneath
a
smooth
humility
just
as
the
shifting
harmonies
that
accompany
him
all
but
hide
the
firm
pedal
point
beneath
them
addresses
with
great
deference
calling
her
at
first
it
is
only
after
he
has
involved
her
emotions
in
his
scheme
that
he
uses
her
given
name
placing
himself
by
implication
in
the
position
of
a
solicitous
father
this
scene
is
a
close
parallel
to
one
that
was
writing
at
the
same
time
the
scene
between
and
and
have
the
same
purpose
forcing
the
girl
to
charm
the
man
she
loves
into
serving
her
cause
and
their
tactics
are
much
the
same
begins
by
describing
the
sad
state
of
the
this
brings
a
reaction
of
distress
from
music
becomes
ethereal
as
he
calls
up
a
vision
of
her
own
sainthood
it
is
she
he
tells
her
who
can
bring
the
truth
to
and
convert
the
heretics
if
in
a
trance
she
repeats
his
words
then
realizes
with
a
shock
her
own
audacity
is
no
assignment
for
a
frivolous
girl
she
assures
him
comes
to
the
point
and
we
hear
for
the
first
time
a
long
downward
chromatic
scale
that
will
become
the
characteristic
motif
of
his
sinister
power
is
a
phrase
as
arresting
as
a
gesture
with
a
piquant
turn
of
harmony
giving
an
effect
of
strangeness
theme
sinuously
chromatic
appears
as
he
directs
her
to
gain
power
over
by
any
means
even
at
the
cost
of
her
honor
from
a
priest
the
music
sounds
as
odd
as
the
advice
rebels
at
this
suggestion
pride
is
as
much
at
stake
as
her
virtue
she
is
the
unattainable
beauty
the
princess
who
turns
away
suitors
by
the
dozen
she
denounces
for
his
evil
thoughts
and
orders
him
to
leave
her
once
the
pulls
out
all
the
stops
music
of
a
menacing
darkness
he
describes
the
powers
of
gaining
control
of
the
girl
poisoning
her
soul
with
pride
and
destroying
her
beauty
combined
threat
of
and
ugliness
is
too
much
for
her
and
she
falls
terrified
at
his
feet
another
sudden
change
of
mood
he
is
again
calm
and
protective
exhorting
her
to
trust
and
obey
him
as
spokesman
and
the
chromatic
scale
descends
in
ominous
contradiction
the
source
of
power
is
his
captive
now
we
are
reminded
of
this
at
the
end
of
the
next
scene
when
his
theme
cuts
through
the
warmth
of
the
love
duet
again
throwing
a
chill
over
the
atmosphere
most
unusual
feature
of
however
is
the
use
of
the
greatest
character
of
all
the
chorus
is
the
real
protagonist
of
the
drama
the
conflict
is
not
versus
or
or
even
the
ghost
of
the
murdered
child
but
versus
the
people
makes
this
quite
clear
by
the
extent
to
which
choral
scenes
propel
the
action
first
entrance
seems
almost
a
footnote
to
the
splendor
of
the
with
its
dazzling
confusion
of
tonalities
have
a
brief
glimpse
of
the
public
personality
the
official
but
our
real
focus
is
on
the
excitement
of
the
crowd
a
significant
contrast
with
its
halfhearted
acclamation
in
the
opening
scene
its
bitter
resentment
and
fury
in
the
final
act
reason
for
the
unique
vitality
of
the
chorus
is
its
great
variety
in
expression
rarely
speaks
as
a
unit
in
its
most
conventional
appearance
the
song
of
praise
to
there
are
a
few
female
dissenters
criticizing
the
princess
for
her
coldness
many
passages
for
example
the
council
of
boyars
each
section
of
the
chorus
becomes
a
character
group
with
a
particular
opinion
arguments
arise
between
tenors
and
basses
who
will
sing
in
harmony
only
when
they
agree
on
an
idea
opening
scene
shows
this
method
at
its
most
individual
paints
a
telling
picture
of
the
common
people
those
who
must
suffer
the
effects
of
their
struggle
for
power
without
understanding
the
causes
are
held
in
control
by
force
but
barely
will
kneel
and
plead
for
leadership
in
a
strangely
intense
song
its
phrases
irregularly
broken
as
if
gasping
for
breath
but
when
the
police
with
their
cudgels
move
away
they
mock
and
grumble
and
fight
among
themselves
is
a
quick
change
from
the
plaintive
song
to
a
conversational
tone
asks
one
group
what
are
we
shouting
about
apparently
the
intellectual
leader
of
the
crowd
replies
that
he
has
no
notion
jokes
and
arguments
grow
louder
until
the
police
return
then
the
people
strike
up
their
song
with
even
more
fervor
than
before
ending
it
with
a
wail
of
despair
frequently
uses
liturgical
music
with
considerable
dramatic
force
cell
the
soft
prayers
of
the
monks
heard
from
offstage
not
only
help
to
set
the
scene
but
emphasize
the
contrast
between
young
thoughts
and
his
situation
is
especially
striking
between
quiet
exit
and
vehement
outburst
against
as
feels
himself
nearing
death
a
procession
files
into
the
hall
singing
a
hymn
its
modal
harmonies
adding
a
churchly
touch
to
the
grim
atmosphere
words
are
hardly
calculated
to
put
the
mind
at
ease
echo
the
words
with
which
he
has
described
his
own
vision
of
the
dying
child
who
trembles
and
begs
for
mercy
and
there
is
no
mercy
living
as
well
as
the
dead
now
accuse
him
this
final
reminder
of
his
guilt
is
the
fatal
one
of
the
outstanding
assets
of
the
present
production
is
the
restoration
of
the
scene
usually
omitted
from
performances
and
rarely
included
in
a
published
score
brief
it
has
a
sharp
dramatic
edge
and
great
poignancy
addition
it
is
an
important
link
in
the
plot
giving
us
a
revealing
glimpse
of
the
attitude
toward
and
the
false
mayhem
in
the
forest
of

a
natural
sequel
scene
opens
with
little
groups
of
beggars
milling
around
the
square
the
ever
present
police
keeping
them
under
scrutiny
the
orchestra
we
hear
first
a
hushed
hesitant
pizzicato
figure
then
the
insistent
police
motif
as
it
appeared
in
the
opening
scene
service
is
over
and
a
number
of
people
come
from
the
church
with
their
spokesman
in
the
lead
bring
the
news
that
the
has
been
excommunicated
this
is
met
with
scorn
by
the
hearers
who
claim
that
is
lying
or
drunk
cleverly
contrasts
the
two
groups
by
their
orchestral
accompaniment
solemn
chords
or
mocking
staccatos
is
still
more
news
announces
they
have
prayed
for
the
soul
of
the
far
these
remarks
like
most
criticisms
of
have
tacitly
assumed
that
his
poetry
is
all
of
a
piece
one
solid
mass
of
verse
expressing
a
sensibility
at
a
single
stage
of
development
critics
has
had
no
poetic
periods
one
does
not
speak
of
early
or
late
or
of
the
or
period
but
simply
of
as
of
a
poetic
monolith
seems
odd
when
one
recalls
that
he
wrote
poetry
longer
than
any
other
major
poet
is
dated
between
and
is
dated
might
expect
that
in
a
poetic
career
of
years
some
changes
in
style
and
method
would
have
occurred
some
development
taken
place
is
not
however
the
case
and
development
is
a
term
which
we
can
apply
to
only
in
a
very
limited
sense
a
time
when
poetic
style
and
poetic
belief
as
well
seem
in
a
state
of
continual
flux
stands
out
as
a
poet
of
almost
perverse
consistency
he
struggled
with
philosophy
all
his
life
he
never
got
much
beyond
the
pessimism
of
his
twenties
the
sober
opinion
of
his
letter
to
written
when
was
eighty
years
old
is
essentially
that
of
his
first
philosophical
notebook
entry
made
when
he
was
world
does
not
despise
us
it
only
neglects
us
though
in
his
later
years
he
revised
his
poems
many
times
the
revisions
did
not
alter
the
essential
nature
of
the
style
which
he
had
established
before
he
was
thirty
so
that
while
it
usually
is
easy
to
recognize
a
poem
by
it
is
difficult
to
date
one
is
only
one
sense
in
which
it
is
valid
to
talk
about
development
he
did
develop
toward
a
more
consistent
and
more
effective
control
of
that
tone
which
we
recognize
as
uniquely
his
is
only
one
style
but
in
the
earlier
poems
that
style
is
only
intermittently
evident
and
when
it
is
not
the
style
is
the
style
of
another
poet
or
of
the
fashion
of
the
time
the
later
poems
however
the
personal
tone
predominates
bad
early
poems
are
bad
or
bad
the
bad
late
poems
are
bad
are
two
ways
of
getting
at
a
development
through
his
dated
poems
and
through
the
revisions
which
he
made
in
later
editions
of
his
work
a
quarter
of
poems
carry
an
appended
date
line
usually
the
year
of
completion
but
sometimes
inclusive
years
or
two
separate
dates
when
worked
on
the
poem
and
or
an
approximate
date
the
dates
are
virtually
the
only
clues
we
have
to
the
chronology
of
the
poems
since
the
separate
volumes
are
neither
chronological
within
themselves
nor
in
relation
to
each
other
the
exception
of
each
volume
contains
dated
poems
ranging
over
several
decades
spans
years
the
internal
organization
rarely
has
any
chronological
order
except
in
obvious
groups
like
the
of
the
of
and
the
war
poems
the
dated
poems
we
can
venture
certain
conclusions
about
career
in
poetry
always
remembering
that
conclusions
based
on
a
fraction
of
the
whole
must
remain
tentative
dated
poems
suggest
that
while
concern
with
poetry
may
have
been
constant
his
production
was
not
had
two
productive
periods
one
in
the
late
the
other
in
the
decade
from
to
half
of
the
dated
poems
are
from
the
latter
period
and
these
alone
total
about
of
all
poems
was
one
sterile
period
only
one
poem
is
dated
between
and
and
except
for
the
poems
written
on
the
trip
to
in
very
few
from
to
dated
poems
also
give
us
an
idea
of
the
degree
to
which
drew
upon
past
productions
for
his
various
volumes
and
therefore
probably
are
an
indication
of
the
amount
of
poetry
he
was
writing
at
the
time
and
both
published
while
was
at
work
on
draw
heavily
on
poems
written
before
and
coming
during
his
most
productive
decade
are
relatively
the
former
contains
no
poem
dated
before
that
is
no
poem
from
a
period
covered
by
a
previous
volume
and
the
latter
has
only
a
few
such
last
three
volumes
are
again
more
dependent
on
the
past
as
creative
powers
declined
in
his
old
age
observations
about
productivity
tally
with
the
details
of
his
life
as
we
know
them
first
productive
period
came
when
he
was
considering
poetry
as
a
vocation
before
he
had
decided
to
write
fiction
for
a
living
in
his
note
for
he
wrote
that
he
wrote
verses
gave
up
verse
for
prose
but
resumed
it
later
the
poetically
sterile
years
he
was
writing
novels
at
the
rate
of
almost
one
a
year
and
was
in
addition
burdened
with
bad
health
he
spent
six
months
in
bed
in
too
ill
to
do
more
than
work
slowly
and
painfully
at
entries
in
support
the
assumption
that
during
this
period
had
virtually
suspended
the
writing
of
poetry
records
that
at
the
end
of
he
makes
a
note
of
an
intention
to
resume
poetry
as
soon
as
possible
and
on
wrote
thinking
of
resuming
the
viewless
before
dawn
this
morning
new
horizons
seemed
to
open
and
worrying
pettinesses
to
disappear
are
more
poems
dated
in
the
than
in
the
had
apparently
resumed
the
viewless
wings
as
he
decreased
the
volume
of
his
fiction
but
none
in
the
year
of
and
only
one
in
the
year
of
the
number
increases
and
in
the
next
thirty
years
there
is
only
one
year
for
which
there
is
no
dated
poem
when
was
at
work
on
second
productive
period
the
decade
from
to
can
be
related
to
three
events
the
completion
of
in
which
left
free
of
pressure
for
the
first
time
in
forty
years
the
death
of
in
which
had
a
profound
emotional
effect
on
for
which
he
found
release
in
poetry
and
the
may
seem
strange
that
a
poet
should
come
to
full
fruition
in
his
seventies
but
we
have
it
on
own
authority
that
he
was
a
child
till
he
was
sixteen
a
youth
till
he
was
and
a
young
man
till
he
was
nearly
fifty
may
carry
this
sequence
one
step
further
and
say
that
at
seventy
he
was
a
poet
at
the
height
of
his
powers
wanting
only
the
impetus
of
two
tragedies
one
personal
the
other
national
to
loose
those
powers
in
poetry
two
productive
decades
were
separated
by
forty
years
yet
between
them
he
developed
only
in
that
he
became
more
steadily
himself
it
was
a
narrowing
not
an
expanding
process
a
wise
gardener
pruned
away
the
sonnets
and
songs
and
the
elements
of
meter
and
poetic
diction
to
which
his
personal
style
was
not
suited
and
let
the
main
stock
of
his
talent
flourish
range
of
the
later
poetry
is
considerably
narrower
but
the
number
of
successful
poems
is
far
greater
can
see
the
general
characteristics
of
the
earlier
decade
if
we
look
at
two
poems
of
very
different
qualities
and
is
not
much
to
be
said
for
about
half
of
the
poems
it
is
a
sonnet
on
a
conventional
theme
the
unhappiness
of
love
anyone
could
have
written
it
it
is
competent
in
the
sense
that
it
makes
a
coherent
statement
without
violating
the
rules
of
the
sonnet
form
but
it
is
entirely
undistinguished
and
entirely
unlike
language
is
the
conventional
language
of
the
form
there
is
no
phrase
or
image
that
sounds
like
or
that
is
striking
enough
to
give
individuality
to
the
poem
is
smoother
than
usually
is
but
with
the
smoothness
of
anonymity
is
obviously
a
young
poem
written
out
of
books
and
not
out
of
experience
it
asserts
emotion
without
evoking
it
that
is
to
say
it
is
sentimental
are
many
such
competently
anonymous
performances
among
the
earlier
poems
we
immediately
recognize
as
a
fine
poem
in
most
characteristic
style
the
plain
but
not
quite
colloquial
language
the
hard
particular
colorless
images
the
slightly
odd
the
dramatic
handling
of
the
occasion
the
refusal
to
resolve
the
issue
all
these
we
have
seen
in
best
poems
poem
does
not
distort
the
syntax
of
ordinary
speech
nor
draw
on
exotic
sources
of
diction
yet
it
is
obviously
not
ordinary
speech
only
would
say
a
grin
of
bitterness
swept
thereby
like
an
ominous
bird
or
wrings
with
wrong
or
would
describe
a
winter
sun
as
details
of
the
setting
of
are
not
strictly
speaking
metaphorical
but
they
combine
to
create
a
mood
which
is
appropriate
both
to
a
dismal
winter
day
and
to
the
end
of
love
and
in
this
way
love
and
weather
the
emotions
and
the
elements
symbolize
each
other
in
a
way
that
is
common
to
many
of
best
poems
and
and
for
example
and
to
some
moving
passages
in
the
novels
as
well
is
full
of
scenes
constructed
in
this
way
is
an
excellent
example
of
mature
style
drawn
from
his
earliest
productive
period
cite
it
as
evidence
that
he
did
not
develop
through
new
styles
as
he
grew
older
as
did
but
that
he
simply
learned
to
use
better
what
he
already
had
the
poem
we
recognize
and
acknowledge
one
sense
of
the
world
if
it
is
somber
it
is
also
precise
and
the
precision
lends
authority
to
the
vision
on
the
other
hand
the
pessimism
is
a
case
not
proven
the
poem
offers
nothing
to
persuade
us
of
the
right
to
speak
as
he
does
the
decade
there
are
many
poems
like
but
there
is
only
one
was
not
very
often
of
offer
a
good
example
of
style
as
it
was
manifested
in
the
later
productive
decade
are
the
poems
wrote
after
the
death
of
his
first
wife
they
compose
a
painful
elegy
to
what
might
have
been
to
a
marriage
that
began
with
a
promise
of
happiness
and
ended
in
long
years
of
suffering
and
hatred
obviously
felt
that
these
poems
were
peculiarly
personal
and
private
he
sometimes
called
them
an
expiation
and
he
would
not
allow
them
to
be
published
in
periodicals
are
the
only
poems
that
he
rearranged
as
a
group
between
their
first
appearance
in
and
the
publication
of
the
elegiac
tone
is
natural
tone
of
voice
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
poems
are
consistently
and
unmistakably
his
view
is
always
toward
the
past
but
the
mood
is
not
quite
nostalgic
would
not
allow
sentiment
to
soften
his
sense
of
the
irredeemable
pastness
of
the
past
and
the
eternal
deadness
of
the
dead
poems
are
the
epigraph
tells
us
the
traces
of
an
ancient
flame
the
fire
of
love
is
dead
and
stands
as
the
speaker
does
in
the
last
poem
of
the
sequence
over
the
burnt
circle
of
charred
sticks
and
thinks
of
past
happiness
and
present
grief
honest
and
uncomforted
invisible
modern
revolt
like
and
radioactivity
is
perceived
only
by
its
effects
at
more
materialistic
social
levels
where
it
is
called
delinquency
by
the
way
is
the
term
used
by
the
critic
and
poet
who
has
written
several
articles
on
this
subject
the
first
of
which
in
quoted
as
disaffiliate
the
pillars
of
like
two
ruined
guarding
the
entrance
to
one
of
circles
stand
two
great
dead
juvenile
delinquents
the
heroes
of
the
generation
the
great
saxophonist
and
the
word
deliberate
means
anything
both
of
them
certainly
deliberately
destroyed
themselves
of
them
were
overcome
by
the
horror
of
the
world
in
which
they
found
themselves
because
at
last
they
could
no
longer

that
world
with
the
weapon
of
a
purely
lyrical
art
of
them

my
friends
in
saw
them
seldom
enough
to
see
them
with
a
perspective
which
was
not
distorted
by
exasperation
or

accelerated

conflagration

swept
away
by
a
torrent
of

a
great
deal
more
in

the
same
disastrous

artists
they
were
very
similar
were
both
very
fluent
this
fluent
enchanting
utterance
had
compared
with
important
artists
of
the
past
relatively
little
content
of
them
got
very
far
beyond
a
sort
of
entranced
rapture
at
his
own
creativity
principal
theme
of
poetry
was
the
ambivalence
of
birth
and
death
the
pain
of
creation
of
course
is
not
so
explicit
an
art
but
anybody
who
knew
knows
that
he
felt
much
the
same
way
about
his
own
gift
of
them
did
communicate
one
central
theme
the
ruin
of
the
world
there
is
only
one
defense
the
creative
act
of
course
is
the
theme
of
much
art
perhaps
most
poetry
is
the
theme
of
who
certainly
otherwise
bears
little
resemblance
to
or
difference
is
that
accepted
his
theme
with
a
kind
of
silken
assurance
and
it
was
an
agony
and
terror
do
not
believe
that
this
is
due
to
anything
especially
frightful
about
their
relationship
to
their
own
creativity
believe
rather
that
it
is
due
to
the
catastrophic
world
in
which
that
creativity
seemed
to
be
the
sole
value
column
of
imperishable
verse
shines
quietly
enough
in
the
lucid
air
of
may
have
been
for
him
the
most
enduring
orderly
and
noble
activity
of
man
the
other
activities
of
his
life
partook
of
these
values
did
not
actively
negate
them
verse
had
to
find
endurance
in
a
world
of
burning
cities
and
burning
was
able
to
find
meaning
in
his
art
as
long
as
it
was
the
answer
to
air
raids
and
gas
ovens
the
world
began
to
take
on
the
guise
of
an
immense
air
raid
or
gas
oven
believe
his
art
became
meaningless
to
him
think
all
this
could
apply
to
just
as
well
although
because
of
the
nature
of
music
it
is
not
demonstrable
at
least
not
conclusively
and
have
more
in
common
than
theme
attitude
life
pattern
the
practice
of
their
art
there
is
an
obvious
technical
resemblance
to
popular
belief
they
were
not
great
technical
innovators
effects
are
only
superficially
startling
is
a
regression
from
the
technical
originality
and
ingenuity
of
writers
like
or
the
innovations
of
bop
and
of
particularly
have
been
vastly
overrated
by
people
unfamiliar
with
music
especially
by
that
ignoramus
the
intellectual
jitterbug
the
jazz
aficionado
tonal
novelties
consist
in
the
introduction
of
a
few
chords
used
in
classical
music
for
centuries
there
is
less
rhythmic
difference
between
progressive
jazz
no
matter
how
progressive
and
than
there
is
between
two
movements
of
many
conventional
symphonies
and
his
contemporaries
is
an
anomaly
did
was
to
absorb
the
musical
ornamentation
of
the
older
jazz
into
the
basic
structure
of
which
it
then
became
an
integral
part
and
with
which
it
then
developed
is
true
of
the
melodic
line
which
could
be
put
together
from
selected
passages
of
almost
anybody
is
true
of
the
rhythmic
pattern
in
which
the
beat
shifts
continuously
or
at
least
is
continuously
sprung
so
that
it
becomes
ambiguous
enough
to
allow
the
pattern
to
be
dominated
by
the
long
pulsations
of
the
phrase
or
strophe
is
exactly
what
happened
in
the
transition
from
baroque
to
rococo
music
is
the
difference
between
and
is
not
a
farfetched
analogy
to
say
that
this
is
what
did
to
poetry
special
syntactical
effects
of
a
or
an
actually
ornaments
become
the
main
concern
metaphysical
conceits
which
fascinate
the
still
dominant
in
backwater
colleges
were
embroideries
ellipses
and
ambiguities
are
ends
in
themselves
immediate
theme
if
it
exists
is
incidental
and
his
main
theme
the
terror
of
birth
is
simply
reiterated
is
one
difference
between
and
which
should
be
pointed
out
contrary
to
popular
belief
there
is
nothing
crazy
or
frantic
about
either
musically
or
emotionally
sinuous
melody
is
a
sort
of
naive
transcendence
of
all
experience
it
does
not
resemble
or
it
resembles
is
true
also
of
a
painter
like
may
have
been
eccentric
in
his
behavior
but
his
paintings
are
as
impassive
as
tiles
this
difference
is
due
to
the
nature
of
verbal
communication
insistent
of
the
general
environment
obtrudes
into
even
the
most
idyllic
poetry
is
much
more
a
personal
difference
certainly
wanted
to
tell
people
about
the
ruin
and
disorder
of
the
world
and
wanted
to
substitute
a
work
of
art
for
the
world
pure
and
simple
rendition
is
not
of
major
importance
but
it
is
interesting
that
following
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
saxophone
revolution
modern
jazz
the
saxophone
is
treated
as
a
woodwind
and
played
with
conventional
embouchure
verse
was
extremely
conventional
as
was
incidentally
the
verse
of
that
other
tragic
enrage
want
to
make
clear
what
consider
the
one
technical
development
in
the
first
wave
of
significant
arts
is
confabulation
in
the
interstices
of
structure
poem
by
a
saxophone
solo
by
a
painting
by
these
are
pure
confabulations
as
ends
in
themselves
has
come
to
determine
structure
lyricism
should
be
distinguished
from
its
exact
opposite
the
sterile
extraneous
invention
of
the
metaphysicals
or
present
blight
of
poetic
professors
as
had
little
influence
on
anyone
except
very
reactionary
writers
like
for
instance
to
whom
was
the
last
word
in
modern
poetry
and
the
felicities
of
an
let
alone
a
were
nonsense
so
influence
has
been
slight
indeed
fact
his
only
disciple
the
only
person
to
imitate
his
style
was
who
seems
to
have
imitated
him
without
much
understanding
and
who
has
since
moved
on
to
other
methods
principal
influence
lay
in
the
communication
of
an
attitude
that
of
the
now
extinct
romantic
school
of
the
and
others
all
of
whom
were
quite
conventional
poets
certainly
had
much
more
of
an
influence
one
time
it
was
the
ambition
of
every
saxophone
player
in
every
high
school
band
in
to
blow
like
before
his
death
this
influence
had
begun
to
ebb
fact
the
whole
generation
of
the
founding
fathers
of
bop
and
the
rest
are
just
now
at
a
considerable
discount
main
line
of
development
today
goes
back
to
and
them
point
is
that
many
of
the
most
impressive
developments
in
the
arts
nowadays
are
aberrant
idiosyncratic
is
no
longer
any
sense
of
continuing
development
of
the
sort
that
can
be
traced
from
to
or
for
that
matter
from
through
to
cubist
generation
before
and
on
a
lower
level
the
surrealists
of
the
period
between
the
wars
both
assumed
an
accepted
universe
of
discourse
in
which
to
quote
it
was
possible
to
make
definite
advances
exactly
as
in
the
sciences
doubt
if
anyone
holds
such
ideas
today
exits
but
like
the
music
developed
from
it
is
a
continuity
sustained
by
popular
demand
the
plastic
arts
a
very
similar
situation
exists
like
and
might
talk
of
creation
by
hazard
of
composing
pictures
by
walking
on
them
with
painted
soles
or
by
tossing
bits
of
paper
up
in
the
air
it
is
obvious
that
they
were
looks
anything
like
an
or
an
but
another
or
looks
less
like
their
work
than
the
happenings
of
random
occasion
of
the
abstract
expressionists
apostles
of
the
discipline
of
spontaneity
and
hazard
look
alike
and
do
look
like
accidents
aesthetic
appeal
of
pure
paint
laid
on
at
random
may
exist
but
it
is
a
very
impoverished
appeal
again
what
has
happened
is
an
confabulation
of
the
incidentals
the
accidents
of
painting
is
curious
that
at
its
best
the
work
of
this
school
of
painting
and
the
rest
resembles
nothing
so
much
as
the
passage
painting
of
quite
unimpressive
painters
the
shimmer
in
the
background
of
a
itself
a
formula
derived
from
the
splashes
of
light
and
black
which
fake
drapery
in
the
fashionable
imitators
of
and
work
of
this
sort
is
presented
as
calligraphy
the
pure
utterance
of
the
brush
stroke
seeking
only
absolute
painteresque
values
have
only
to
compare
such
painting
with
the
work
of
say
to
realize
that
someone
is
using
words
and
brushes
carelessly
its
best
the
abstract
expressionists
achieve
a
simple
rococo
decorative
surface
poverty
shows
up
immediately
when
compared
with
where
the
rococo
rises
to
painting
of
extraordinary
profundity
and
power
painting
however
confabulated
is
a
universe
of
tensions
in
vast
depths
is
an
object
of
art
bijouterie
disguised
only
by
its
great
size
fact
once
the
size
is
big
enough
to
cover
a
whole
wall
it
turns
into
nothing
more
than
extremely
expensive
wallpaper
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
complicated
wallpaper
is
just
more
to
great
brush
painters
painted
wallpapers
too
at
least
portable
ones
screens
process
of
elimination
which
leaves
the
artist
with
nothing
but
the
play
of
his
materials
themselves
cannot
sustain
interest
in
either
artist
or
public
for
very
long
in
the
last
couple
of
years
abstract
expressionism
has
tended
toward
romantic
suggestion
indications
of
landscape
or
living
figures
and
epic
each
provide
on
two
occasions
a
seemingly
authentic
account
of
the
narration
of
verse
in
the
heroic
age
court
bard
sings
of
the
encounters
at
lines
and
improvises
the
tale
of
exploits
in
a
complimentary
comparison
of
the
visitor
with
lines
court
bard
sings
of
the
discovered
adultery
of
and
and
takes
up
a
tale
of
while
the
wanderer
listens
on
in
all
this
is
autobiographical
unlike
the
poets
of
and
the
poet
of
is
not
concerned
with
his
own
identity
the
poet
of
reputed
blind
reveals
himself
not
at
all
in
singing
of
the
blind
minstrel
none
of
these
glimpses
of
poetizing
without
writing
is
intended
to
incorporate
a
signature
into
the
epic
matter
there
is
evidence
that
and
the
poems
each
derive
from
an
oral
tradition
such
a
tradition
lies
behind
and
at
least
is
hard
to
deny
rigorously
defended
the
observation
that
the
extant
poems
are
largely
formulaic
and
was
led
to
postulate
that
they
could
be
shown
entirely
formulaic
if
the
complete
corpus
of
epic
survived
he
further
reasoned
that
frequent
formulas
in
epic
verse
indicate
oral
composition
and
assumed
the
slightly
less
likely
corollary
that
oral
epic
is
inclined
towards
the
use
of
formulas
from
conclusions
and
adopting
one
of
his
schemata
argues
that
likewise
was
created
from
a
legacy
of
oral
formulas
inherited
and
extended
by
bards
of
successive
generations
and
the
thesis
is
striking
and
compelling
a
fresh
inspection
will
indicate
one
crucial
amendment
and
the
poems
are
not
at
all
formulaic
to
the
same
extent
bondage
endurable
by
an
oral
poet
is
to
be
estimated
only
by
a
very
skilful
oral
poet
but
it
appears
safe
to
assume
that
no
sustained
narrative
in
rhyme
could
be
composed
without
extreme
difficulty
even
in
a
language
of
many
terminal
inflections
seems
nearly
as
severe
a
curb
although
in
a
celebrated
passage
of
declares
that
was
intoned
before
the
battle
commenced
at
alliterative
line
and
the
hexameter
probably
imposed
less
of
a
restraint
the
verse
of
or
of
and
was
not
easy
to
create
but
was
not
impossible
for
poets
who
had
developed
their
talents
perforce
in
earning
a
livelihood
certain
aids
were
valuable
and
quite
credibly
necessary
for
reciting
long
stretches
of
verse
without
a
pause
poet
in
a
written
tradition
who
generally
never
blots
a
line
may
once
in
a
while
pause
and
polish
without
incurring
blame
the
oral
poet
cannot
pause
he
must
improvise
continuously
with
no
apparent
effort
though
the
bondage
of
his
verse
is
not
so
great
as
the
writing
poet
can
manage
it
is
still
great
enough
for
him
often
to
be
seriously
impeded
unless
he
has
aids
to
facilitate
rapid
composition
poet
had
such
aids
in
the
kennings
which
provided
for
the
difficulties
of
alliteration
the
poet
had
epithets
which
provided
for
recurring
needs
in
the
hexameter
poet
could
quickly
and
easily
select
words
or
phrases
to
supply
his
immediate
requirements
as
he
chanted
out
his
lines
because
the
kennings
and
the
epithets
made
possible
the
construction
of
systems
of
numerous
synonyms
for
the
chief
common
and
proper
nouns
synonyms
could
of
course
serve
the
same
function
and
for
the
sake
of
ease
shall
speak
of
kennings
and
epithets
in
the
widest
and
loosest
possible
sense
and
name
for
example
a
kenning
for
the
and
adverbial
elements
too
participated
in
each
epic
diction
but
it
is
for
the
present
sufficient
to
mark
the
large
nominal
and
adjectival
supply
of
semantic
and
to
designate
the
members
of
any
system
of
equivalents
as
basic
formulas
of
the
poetic
language
to
a
few
thousand
lines
of
heroic
verse
in
as
in
the
other
dialects
we
cannot
say
how
frequently
the
kennings
in
recurred
in
contemporary
epic
on
the
same
soil
we
can
say
that
since
a
writing
poet
with
leisure
before
him
would
seem
unlikely
to
invent
a
technique
based
upon
frequent
and
substantial
circumlocution
the
kennings
like
the
epithets
must
reasonably
be
ascribed
to
an
oral
tradition
of
the
greatest
of
our
time
argues
that
when
it
is
assumed
and
are
oral
poems
the
postulated
single
redactor
called
cannot
be
either
credited
with
or
denied
originality
in
choice
of
phrasing
example
of
grand
or
exquisite
diction
may
have
been
created
by
the
poet
who
compiled
numerous
lays
into
the
two
works
we
possess
or
may
be
due
to
one
of
his
completely
unknown
quest
of
the
historical
is
likely
never
to
have
further
success
no
individual
word
in
or
can
be
credited
to
any
one
man
no
strikingly
effective
element
of
speech
in
the
extant
poems
can
with
assurance
be
said
not
to
have
been
a
commonplace
in
the
vaster
epic
corpus
that
may
have
existed
at
the
beginning
of
the
first
millennium
before
observation
is
of
interest
not
only
to
students
of
poetry
but
to
students
of
poetry
as
well
the
extent
that
a
tale
is
twice
told
its
final
author
must
be
suspect
although
plagiarism
in
an
oral
tradition
is
less
a
misdemeanor
than
the
standard
modus
dicendi
argues
further
and
here
he
makes
his
main
point
that
once
and
are
thought
formulaic
poems
composed
for
an
audience
accustomed
to
formulaic
poetry
critics
are
deprived
of
an
entire
domain
they
previously
found
arable
a
few
important
and
a
few
more
unimportant
exceptions
no
expression
can
be
deemed
le
mot
juste
for
its
context
because
each
was
very
probably
the
only
expression
that
practice
and
ease
of
rapid
recitation
would
allow
or
phrases
that
connoisseurs
have
admired
as
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
must
therefore
lose
merit
and
become
regarded
as
mere
inevitable
sometimes
accurate
and
sometimes
not
observation
too
may
have
reference
to
poetry
the
extent
that
a
language
is
formulaic
its
individual
components
must
be
regarded
as
no
more
distinguished
than
other
cliches
suggests
that
certain
kennings
in
were
selected
sometimes
for
appropriateness
and
sometimes
for
ironic
inappropriateness
but
such
a
view
would
appear
untenable
unless
it
is
denied
that
the
language
of
is
formulaic
the
master
of
scops
who
was
most
responsible
for
the
poem
ever
used
kennings
that
were
traditional
he
was
at
least
partly
deprived
of
free
will
and
not
inclined
towards
shrewd
and
sophisticated
misuse
of
speech
elements
many
significant
phrases
are
found
in
theory
or
in
recurrent
practice
to
provide
for
prosodic
necessity
they
are
not
to
be
defended
for
their
semantic
properties
in
isolated
contexts
is
false
to
be
certain
of
having
discovered
in
the
language
of
such
effects
as
intentional
irony
if
the
argument
is
turned
awry
there
may
be
found
a
great
deal
in
view
after
all
formulaic
element
need
not
be
held
meaningless
merely
because
it
was
selected
with
little
conscious
reflection
though
the
periphrastic
expressions
are
they
may
nevertheless
be
handsome
or
ironic
or
humorous
long
evolution
in
an
oral
tradition
caused
the
poetic
language
of
the
heroic
age
to
be
based
upon
formulas
that
show
the
important
qualities
of
things
and
these
formulas
are
therefore
potentially
rather
than
always
actually
accurate
we
do
not
know
how
they
were
regarded
in
their
day
but
we
need
not
believe
the
epic
audience
to
have
been
more
insensitive
to
the
formulas
than
the
numerous
scholars
of
modern
times
who
have
read
or
poetry
all
their
lives
and
still
found
much
to
admire
in
occasional
occurrences
of
the
most
familiar
phrases
and
adjectives
in
a
written
tradition
are
chosen
for
the
nonce
in
an
oral
tradition
they
may
be
chosen
for
the
entire
epic
corpus
and
tend
towards
idealization
rather
than
distinctive
delineation
is
therefore
not
to
be
placed
upon
the
archaeological
particulars
in
an
oral
poem
today
would
hope
to
discover
the
unmistakable
ruins
of
or
the
palace
of
ship
at
could
be
called
a
floater
in
or
a
swift
ship
in
when
defenseless
of
weapons
the
would
be
as
their
king
is
and
would
be
like
in
is
potentially
the
swiftest
of
men
and
may
accordingly
be
called
even
when
he
stands
idle
the
agnomen
of
is
used
deliberately
and
pointedly
but
the
epithets
and
the
kennings
are
used
casually
and
recall
to
the
hearer
a
familiar
story
or
situation
or
a
useful
or
pleasant
quality
of
the
referent
epic
language
was
not
entirely
the
servant
of
the
poet
it
was
partly
his
master
intentions
are
difficult
to
discern
and
except
to
biographers
unimportant
the
language
however
is
a
proper
object
of
scrutiny
and
the
effects
of
the
language
are
palpable
even
if
sometimes
inevitable
and
the
poems
appear
oral
compositions
they
are
written
at
some
stage
in
their
evolution
they
were
transcribed
suggests
that
the
poems
were
dictated
to
a
scribe
by
a
minstrel
who
held
in
his
mind
the
poems
fully
matured
but
did
not
himself
possess
the
knowledge
of
writing
since
it
would
be
useless
to
his
guild
and
argues
that
the
poet
and
may
have
dictated
their
verse
in
the
same
fashion
explanation
is
attractive
but
is
vitiated
at
least
in
part
by
the
observation
that
though
he
used
kennings
in
the
traditional
manner
was
a
literate
man
who
four
times
inscribed
his
name
by
runes
into
his
works
was
literate
the
poet
may
have
been
also
and
so
may
the
final
redactor
of
and
lieu
of
the
amanuensis
to
the
blind
or
illiterate
bard
one
may
conceive
of
a
man
who
heard
a
vast
store
of
oral
poetry
recited
and
became
intimately
familiar
with
the
established
aids
to
poetizing
and
himself
wrote
his
own
compositions
or
his
edition
of
the
compositions
of
the
past
theories
of
origin
are
compatible
with
the
formulaic
theory
may
contain
a
design
for
terror
and
may
have
a
vast
pattern
answering
to
a
ceramic
pattern
produced
during
the
in
pottery
account
of
the
growth
and
final
transcription
of
these
epics
rests
partly
however
upon
the
degree
to
which
they
were
formulaic
counted
different
lines
repeated
exactly
in
the
two
poems
and
by
increasing
this
figure
so
as
to
include
lines
repeated
with
very
slight
modifications
he
counted
different
lines
used
a
total
of
times
one
line
in
five
from
and
is
to
be
found
somewhere
else
in
the
two
poems
ratio
is
thoroughly
remarkable
because
the
lines
are
so
long
half
again
as
long
as
those
of
poetry
appears
to
have
no
comparable
amount
of
repetition
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
scop
used
and
whole
lines
and
even
lengthy
passages
after
the
manner
of
his
colleague
determining
the
extent
to
which
any
poem
is
formulaic
it
is
idle
however
to
inspect
nothing
besides
lines
repeated
in
their
entirety
for
a
stock
of
would
be
sufficient
to
permit
the
poet
to
extemporize
with
deftness
if
they
provided
for
prosodic
needs
closest
scrutiny
is
owed
to
the
kennings
and
the
epithets

any
words
or
phrases
are
formulaic
they
will

its

and
mythic
content
to

generally
that
much
of
the
impact
resides
in
its
allegoric
insight
and
moral
metaphor
excellent
chapter
on

lately
illustrated
how
fruitfully
that
novel
can
be
read
from
such
a
perspective
his
analysis
however
he
touches
upon
but
fails
to
explore
an
idea
generally
neglected
in
discussions
of
the
book
which
believe
is
central
to
its
art
the
importance
of
human
hands
as
a
recurring
feature
of
the
narrative
essay
seeks
to
make
that
exploration
was
not
for
nothing
the
most
theatrical
of
the
great
writers

instinctively
that
next
to
voice
and
face
an
hands
are
his
most
useful
possession
that
in

as
in
the
theatre
gesture
is
an
indispensable
shorthand
for
individualizing
character
and
dramatizing
action
and
response
is
hardly
accidental
therefore
that
many
of
his
most
vivid
figures
do
suggestive
or
eccentric
things
with
their
hands
the
hands
become
almost
an
obsession
habitually
bites
his
forefinger
a
gesture
which
conveys
both
contempt
and

abstractedness

mannerisms
would
be

worthy
of
remark
were
it
not
that
in
as
in
no
other
of

as

a
crucial
element
of

plot
a
means
of
clarifying
the
structure
of
the
novel
by
helping
to
define
the
relations
with
all
the

and
a
device
for
ordering
such
diverse

have
only
to

of

that

often
call
up
ideas
of
crime

punishment
it
is
with
whether
the
hands
be
as
he
strikes
down
or
as
he
steals
a
pie
from
her
pantry
associations
suit
well
with
the
gothic
or
aspects
of
novel
but
on
a
deeper
plane
they
relate
to
the
themes
of
sin
guilt
and
pursuit
that
have
recently
been
analyzed
by
other
critics
novel
opens
with
a
fugitive
convict
frantically
trying
to
avoid
the
nemesis
of
being
laid
hands
on
a
mysterious
figure
who
looks
into
frightened
eyes
in
the
churchyard
as
if
he
were
eluding
the
hands
of
the
dead
people
stretching
up
cautiously
out
of
their
graves
to
get
a
twist
upon
his
ankle
and
pull
him
in
terrifies
into
stealing
a
pork
pie
for
him
by
creating
the
image
in
the
imagination
of
a
bogy
man
who
may
softly
creep
his
way
to
him
and
tear
him
open
imbruing
his
hands
in
him
agonizes
over
the
theft
that
his
own
hands
have
committed
his
guilty
conscience
projects
itself
upon
the
wooden
finger
of
a
local
signpost
transforming
it
into
a
phantom

to

upside
down
in
the
graveyard

in
terror
with
both
hands
to
his
convict
later
he
flees
in
panic
from
the
family
table
just
as
his
theft
is
about
to
be
discovered
and
is
blocked
at
the
front
door
by
a
soldier
who
accusingly
holds
out
a
pair
of
handcuffs
which
he
has
brought
to
forge
for
mending
such
details
indicates
at
the
outset
that
guilt
is
a
part
of
the
ironic
bond
between
and
which
is
so
unpredictably
to
alter
both
their
lives
they
commonly
translate
thoughts
and
feelings
into
deeds
hands
naturally
represent
action
and
since
nearly
half
the
characters
in
are
of
the
underworld
or
closely
allied
to
it
the
linking
of
hands
with
crime
or
violence
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
excellent
psychological
reasons
never
fully
reveals
felonious
past
but
at
the
climactic
reappearance
in
shrinks
from
clasping
a
hand
which
he
fears
might
be
stained
with
blood
slouches
about
the
forge

with
his

in
his
pockets

when
he

to
his
holiday

claps
her

in
a
tantrum

them
upon
her
bosom
and
upon

them
in
her
hair

only
the
prelude
to
the
vicious
blow
upon
her
head
dealt
by
some
unknown
hand
whose
identity
is
later
revealed
not
verbally
but
through
a
manual
action
the
tracing
of

upon
a
slate

is
to
feel

his
unclenched

watered
for
his
victim

his

hang
loose
and

at
his
sides

observes
him
so
intensely
that

she

calling

on
his
having
once
got
her
acquitted
of
a
murder
charge
by
cleverly
contriving
her
sleeves
at
the
trial
to
conceal
her
strength
and
by
passing
off
the
lacerations
on
the
backs
of
her
hands
as
the
scratches

brambles
rather
than
of
human
fingernails
is
the
similarity
between
hands
and
action
of
her

like
the
action
of
knitting
that
provides
with
a
vital
clue
to
the

on

retribution
so
important
a
theme
elsewhere

in
some
way
with
the

that
attach

of

the
description
of
five
little
dead
brothers
who
gave
up
trying

get
a

exceedingly
early
in
that
universal
struggle
who
seemed
to
have
all
been
born
on

never

out

state
of

expectations

progress
through
illusion
and
disillusionment
turn
somewhat
as
they
do
for
the
naive
hero
of
upon
the
lure
of
genteel
prosperity
through
unearned
income
what
calls
portable
property
and
what
reproaches
for
letting
slip
through
his
fingers

must
if
possible
avoid
sullying
them
by
work
his
hands
as
importantly
as
his
accent
become
the
index
of
social
status
the
first
step
in
the
corruption
of
values
is
the
unworthy
shame
he
feels
when
cruelly
remarks
the
coarseness
of
his
hands
had
never
troubled
me
before
but
they
troubled
me
now
as
vulgar
appendages
imagines
how
would
look
down
upon
hands
roughened
by
work
in
the
smithy
and
the
deliberate
contrast
between
her
white
hands
and
his
blackened
ones
is
made
to
symbolize
the
opposition
of
values
between
which
struggles
idleness
and
work
artificiality
and
naturalness
gentility
and
commonness
coldness
and
affection
in

between
and
the
forge
the
snobbery
that
alienates
from
finally
gives
way
before
the
deeper
and
stronger
force
of
love
the
reunion
is
marked
by
an
embarrassed
handshake
at
which
exclaims
wipe
it
off
for
sake
give
me
your
blackened
hand
abject
of
during
which
he
kneels
to
kiss
her
hand
signalizes
his
homage
to
a
supposed
patroness
who
seems
to
be
opening
up
for
him
a
new
world
of
glamour
when
on
the
journey
to
that
immediately
follows
he
pauses
nostalgically
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
at
the
end
of
the
village
the
wooden
pointer
symbolically
designates
a
spiritual
frontier
between
innocence
and
the
corruption
of
worldly
vanity
one
cannot
miss
the
significance
of
this
gesture
for
reintroduces
it
associatively
in
mind
at
another

main

of

warfare
operations
are
defense
of

defense
of

forces
and
area
defense
last
category
overlaps
the
others
in
amphibious
operations
and
near
terminals

bases
effect
these
operations
five
elements
exist
surface
air
mines
submarine
and
fixed
installations
forces
have
been
used
to
provide
defense
zones
around
naval
and
merchant
ship
formations
air
to
furnish
area
surveillance
and
mines
for
protection
of
limited
areas
and
shore
installations
are
new
elements
submarine
now
has
a
definite
place
in
submarine
defense
particularly
in
denying
enemy
access
to
ocean
areas
installations
offer
possibilities
for
area
detection
warfare
is
being
reoriented
against
submarine
targets
sixth
element
not
always
considered
is
intelligence
includes
operational
intelligence
of
the
enemy
and
knowledge
of
the
environment
intelligence
presumably
will
be
available
from
our
national
intelligence
agencies
intelligence
on
the
environment
will
come
from
the
recently
augmented
program
in
oceanography
major
postwar
development
is
the
certainty
that
these
elements
should
not
be
considered
singly
but
in
combination
and
as
being
mutually
supporting
for
an
concept
on
submarine
defense
has
not
always
been
of
single
elements
tend
to
ensure
predominance
of
that
element
without
determining
if
it
is
justified
and
the
element
with
the
most
enthusiastic
and
vociferous
proponents
has
assumed
the
greatest
importance
air
surface
and
submarine
elements
overshadow
the
mine
fixed
installations
and
intelligence
have
sought
more
and
more
of
what
they
have
seems
to
strive
for
elimination
of
the
necessity
for
the
others
despite
postwar
experience
demonstrating
that
all
elements
are
necessarily
mutually
supporting
the
most
productive
areas
are
not
necessarily
the
most
stressed
is
stated
to
emphasize
the
necessity
for
an
concept
of
submarine
defense
one
which
would
provide
positions
of
relative
importance
to
elements
based
on
projected
potentialities
the
enthusiasm
and
energy
of
all
elements
can
be
channeled
to
produce
cumulative
progress
toward
a
common
objective
concept
would
have
other
advantages
would
allow
presentation
to
the
public
of
a
unified
approach
the
problem
is
presented
piecemeal
and
sometimes
contradictorily
one
element
is
announcing
progress
another
is
delineating
its
problems
result
can
only
be
confusion
in
the
public
mind
unified
concept
can
serve
as
a
guide
to
budgeting
and
if
public
support
is
gained
will
command
support
main
criticism
of
the
antisubmarine
effort
is
that
it
cannot
determine
where
any
one
company
or
industry
can
apply
its
skills
and
guidance
industry
picks
its
own
areas
result
coupled
with
the
salesmanship
for
which
industry
is
famous
is
considerable
expenditure
of
funds
and
efforts
in
marginal
areas
concept
will
guide
industry
where
available
talents
and
facilities
will
yield
greatest
dividends
a
broad
concept
of
submarine
defense
is
needed
for
of
the
efforts
for
a
logical
presentation
to
the
public
for
guidance
and
as
a
basis
for
a
program
to
the
involved
in
an
concept
which
follows
will
be
a
discussion
of
principles
and
possible
content
for
an
concept
of
antisubmarine
warfare
possesses
the
preponderance
of
submarines
in
the
world
divided
between
her
various
fleets
are
also
in
and
others
are
on
loan
to
countries
which
may
willingly
or
unwillingly
become
can
furnish
bases
target
areas
can
be
assumed
but
there
is
no
certainty
that
such
assumptions
coincide
with
intentions
can
come
from
almost
any
direction
against
many
locations
then
the
first
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
is
not
rigidly
oriented
toward
any
geographical
area
is
often
stated
that
the
submarine
can
be
destroyed
while
building
at
bases
in
transit
and
on
station
of
the
building
and
base
complex
however
requires
attacks
on
enemy
territory
which
is
possible
only
in
event
of
hostilities
transit
or
on
station
it
may
not
be
possible
to
attack
the
submarines
until
commission
of
an
overt
act
are
adept
at
utilizing
hostilities
short
of
general
war
and
will
do
so
whenever
it
is
to
their
advantage
the
second
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
while
providing
for
hostilities
its
effectiveness
is
not
dependent
on
general
war
warfare
does
not
involve
clashes
between
large
opposing
forces
with
the
decision
a
result
of
a
single
battle
is
a
war
of
attrition
of
single
actions
of
an
exchange
of
losses
exchange
must
result
in
our
ending
up
with
some
effective
units
having
fewer
units
of
some
elements
especially
submarines
than
the
opponent
our
capabilities
need
to
be
sufficiently
greater
than
theirs
so
that
the
exchange
will
be
in
our
favor
the
third
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
does
not
depend
for
effectiveness
on
engagement
by
the
same
types
unless
at
an
assured
favorable
exchange
rate
submarine
has
increased
its
effectiveness
by
several
orders
of
magnitude
since
speed
has
increased
it
operates
at
increasingly
greater
depths
its
submerged
endurance
is
becoming
unlimited
and
it
will
become
even
more
silent
next
developments
will
probably
be
in
weaponry
missile
can
gradually
be
expected
to
replace
the
torpedo
detection
ranges
increase
weapons
will
be
developed
to
attack
other
submarines
and
surface
craft
at
these
ranges
the
fourth
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
provide
for
continuously
increasing
capabilities
in
the
opponent
element
can
accomplish
the
total
objective
of
submarine
defense
elements
support
the
others
but
all
have
limitations
limitations
of
one
element
can
be
compensated
for
by
a
capability
of
another
used
in
combination
will
increase
the
capability
more
than
the
sum
of
the
capabilities
of
the
individual
elements
the
fifth
principle
must
be
that
it
capitalize
on
the
capabilities
of
all
elements
in
combination
the
submarine
defense
problem
can
be
solved
by
sufficient
forces
would
be
astronomical
and
current
fiscal
policies
make
this
an
impractical
solution
aircraft
procurement
and
weapon
programs
indicate
that
there
will
not
be
enough
of
anything
any
measures
taken
in
peacetime
which
will
decrease
force
requirements
in
war
will
contribute
greatly
to
success
when
hostilities
occur
the
sixth
principle
of
the
plan
must
be
that
it
concentrate
on
current
measures
which
will
reduce
future
force
requirements
world
is
constantly
changing
what
was
new
yesterday
is
obsolescent
today
seventh
principle
of
the
plan
is
it
must
be
flexible
enough
to
allow
for
technological
breakthroughs
scientific
progress
and
changes
in
world
conditions
elements
in
asw
operations
this
point
the
need
for
an
plan
for
submarine
defense
has
been
demonstrated
the
mission
has
been
stated
broad
principles
delineating
its
content
laid
down
and
the
supporting
elements
listed
considering
these
elements
in
more
detail
an
additional
requirement
should
be
stated
area
coverage
will
accomplish
all
other
tasks
because
reduction
in
tasks
results
in
reduction
of
forces
required
the
plan
should
provide
for
expanding
area
coverage
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
plan
should
not
be
oriented
geographically
the
system
giving
area
coverage
if
such
coverage
is
less
than
world
wide
must
be
flexible
and
hence
at
least
partially
mobile
effective
area
coverage
appears
fairly
remote
the
requirement
can
be
borne
in
mind
while
considering
the
elements
air
surface
fixed
installations
mines
and
intelligence
are
arranged
approximately
in
the
order
of
the
vociferousness
of
their
proponents
but
will
be
discussed
in
the
reverse
order
in
the
hope
that
the
true
order
of
importance
will
result
as
used
herein
will
include
information
on
possible
opponents
and
on
the
environment
which
can
affect
operations
can
be
referred
to
as
operational
intelligence
and
environmental
intelligence
submarine
defense
these
must
have
maximum
stress
operational
intelligence
can
ensure
sound
planning
greatly
reduce
force
requirements
and
increase
tactical
effectiveness
intelligence
is
just
as
important
ocean
presently
with
the
target
knowledge
of
the
science
of
oceanography
can
bring
the
environment
to
our
side
resulting
in
an
increase
in
effectiveness
of
equipment
and
tactics
a
decrease
in
enemy
capabilities
and
the
development
of
methods
of
capitalizing
on
the
environment
improved
intelligence
will
result
in
reduced
force
requirements
and
as
it
supports
all
other
elements
rates
a
top
priority
intelligence
is
important
but
of
equal
importance
is
its
translation
into
usable
form
program
is
needed
to
translate
the
results
of
oceanographic
research
into
tactical
and
operating
instructions
this
problem
on
a
statistical
basis
is
invalid
because
the
opponent
has
the
same
sources
available
and
will
be
encountered
not
under
average
conditions
but
under
the
conditions
most
advantageous
to
him
the
commander
must
have
detailed
operating
instructions
based
on
measurement
of
conditions
in
the
area
at
the
time
of
encounter
capabilities
must
be
used
to
maximum
advantage
then
wind
oxygen
content
depth
bottom
character
and
animal
life
are
the
chief
environmental
variables
may
be
others
in
sound
velocity
should
be
measured
rather
than
temperature
because
more
of
the
variables
would
be
encompassed
variations
must
eventually
be
measured
horizontally
as
well
as
vertically
in
predicting
water
conditions
is
encouraging
but
little
guidance
is
available
to
the
man
at
sea
on
the
use
of
such
information
concurrent
effort
is
needed
to
make
oceanographic
data
useful
on
the
spot
warfare
has
in
the
past
been
directed
against
surface
targets
its
nature
it
has
always
been
of
great
psychological
advantage
and
small
efforts
have
required
considerably
greater
are
being
increasingly
oriented
against
submarine
targets
are
still
considered
to
be
for
use
in
restricted
waters
however
and
targets
must
come
within
a
few
yards
of
them
need
to
be
recognized
as
a
major
element
in
warfare
employment
extended
to
deep
water
and
have
their
effective
area
per
unit
increased
can
be
used
to
deny
access
to
great
areas
they
are
difficult
to
counter
cost
little
to
maintain
until
required
and
can
be
put
into
place
quickly
most
attractive
feature
is
that
detection
and
attack
are
combined
in
a
single
package
employment
will
reduce
force
requirements
example
effective
mine
barriers
from
to
and
across
the
from
to
would
remove
all
requirements
for
harbor
defense
inshore
patrol
convoy
escort
shipping
control
and
mine
defense
for
the
entire
of
extended
systems
covering
all
passage

the

free
the
and
the
of
from
the
previously
listed
requirements
covering
the
of
and
possibly
the
entire
coasts
of
the
are
not
impossible
mine
defense
systems
could
permit
concentration
of
mobile
forces
in
the
open
oceans
with
consequent
increase
in
the
probability
of
success
advantages
inherent
in
mine
warfare
justify
as
great
an
importance
for
this
element
as
is
accorded
any
of
the
other
elements
installations
are
increasingly
advocated
as
the
problem
of
area
defense
emerges
proponents
are
scientific
and
technical
men
who

the

this
way
a
degree
of
unification
of
nomenclature
symbols
and
units
will
be
realized
individual
classes
of
foods
differ
in
their
requirements
for
preservation
a
number
of
methods
have
been
developed
over
the
years
involving
one
or
a
combination
of
procedures
such
as
dehydration
fermentation
salting
chemical
treatment
canning
refrigeration
and
freezing
basic
objectives
in
each
instance
are
to
make
available
supplies
of
food
during
the
intervals
between
harvesting
or
slaughter
to
minimize
losses
resulting
from
the
action
of
microorganisms
and
insects
and
to
make
it
possible
to
transport
foods
from
the
area
of
harvest
or
production
to
areas
of
consumption
earlier
years
the
preservation
of
food
was
essentially
related
to
survival
the
more
sophisticated
atmosphere
of
developed
nations
techniques
have
sought
also
to
bring
variety
peak
freshness
and
optimum
taste
and
flavor
in
foods
at
reasonable
cost
to
the
consumer
the
development
of
nuclear
technology
isotopic
materials
and
machine
radiation
sources
in
recent
years
the
possibilities
of
applying
ionizing
radiation
to
the
preservation
of
foods
attracted
the
attention
of
investigators
in
the
and
throughout
the
world
early
hope
that
irradiation
might
be
the
ultimate
answer
to
practically
all
food
preservation
problems
was
soon
dispelled
remained
however
in
the
possibility
that
it
would
serve
as
a
useful
supplementary
method
for
counteracting
spoilage
losses
and
for
preserving
some
foods
at
lower
costs
than
freezing
or
without
employing
heat
or
chemicals
with
their
attendant
taste
alterations
responsible
for
the
spoilage
of
foods
chief
factors
responsible
for
the
spoilage
of
fresh
foodstuffs
are
microorganisms
such
as
bacteria
molds
and
yeasts
enzymes
insects
sprouting
and
chemical
reactions
are
often
responsible
for
the
rapid
spoilage
of
foods
special
concern
is
the
growth
of
bacteria
such
as
botulinum
which
generate
poisonous
products
action
in
stored
food
produces
changes
which
can
adversely
affect
the
appearance
of
food
or
its
palatability
by
chemical
action
results
from
the
reaction
of
one
group
of
components
in
the
food
with
others
or
with
its
environment
as
in
corrosion
of
the
walls
of
metal
containers
or
the
reaction
of
fats
with
oxygen
in
the
air
to
produce
rancidity
is
a
naturally
occurring
phenomenon
in
stored
potatoes
onions
carrots
beets
and
similar
root
vegetables
infestation
is
a
problem
of
importance
chiefly
in
stored
grain
presence
of
parasitic
organisms
such
as
spiralis
in
pork
introduces
another
factor
which
must
be
dealt
with
in
food
processing
permit
the
storage
of
food
for
long
periods
of
time
a
method
of
preservation
must
accomplish
the
destruction
of
microorganisms
and
inhibition
of
enzymatic
action
term
sterilization
applies
to
methods
involving
essentially
complete
destruction
of
all
microorganisms
treated
in
this
manner
and
protected
from
recontamination
by
aseptic
methods
of
packaging
and
containment
presumably
could
be
stored
for
long
periods
without
refrigeration
process
of
pasteurization
involves
milder
and
less
prolonged
heat
treatment
which
accomplishes
the
destruction
of
most
but
not
all
of
the
microorganisms
severe
thermal
treatment
as
by
blanching
or
scalding
serves
to
inactivate
enzymes
effects
of
ionizing
radiation
radiation
can
cause
the
destruction
of
microorganisms
and
insects
involved
in
food
spoilage
or
at
lower
doses
can
inhibit
their
action
furnishes
a
means
of
destroying
insects
in
stored
grain
products
as
well
as
certain
parasitic
organisms
present
in
meats
of
enzymes
is
also
possible
although
some
types
require
extremely
heavy
doses
of
or
more
of
undesirable
flavors
odors
colors
and
generally
low
palatability
associated
with
radiation
treatment
of
this
magnitude
the
inactivation
of
enzymes
is
best
accomplished
prior
to
irradiation
by
the
conventional
methods
of
blanching
does
not
retard
the
chemical
spoilage
of
food
will
however
inhibit
the
sprouting
of
potatoes
and
other
root
vegetables
radiation
doses
required
for
the
preservation
of
foods
are
in
the
following
ranges
radiosterilization
to
destroy
all
organisms
for
preservation
about
for
nonacid
foods
of
low
salt
content
radiopasteurization
to
partially
destroy
microorganisms
results
vary
with
types
of
food
storage
conditions
and
objectives
of
treatment
commonly
of
the
order
of
but
up
to
about
destruction
of
insects
about
inhibiting
the
sprouting
of
root
vegetables
to
foods
with
ionizing
radiation
leads
to
some
undesirable
side
effects
particularly
at
the
higher
radiation
dosages
this
respect
the
general
palatability
and
individual
acceptance
of
most
radiosterilized
foods
has
to
date
been
found
to
be
low
in
comparison
with
fresh
and
commercially
processed
foods
number
of
foods
are
quite
acceptable
as
regards
taste
and
palatability
however
at
dosages
substantially
less
than
sterilization
levels
the
nutritive
value
of
irradiated
foods
apparently
undergoes
little
if
any
change
although
some
of
the
vitamins
are
affected
by
sterilization
doses
sources
irradiation
of
food
the
results
obtained
depend
upon
the
dose
rather
than
the
specific
type
of
radiation
and
gamma
and
electron
radiation
are
suitable
from
availability
and
economic
considerations
each
has
certain
practical
advantages
for
example
gamma
rays
give
deeper
penetration
but
cannot
be
focused
or
collimated
whereas
unidirectional
electron
beams
may
be
split
and
directed
to
both
the
top
and
bottom
of
the
food
package
to
be
irradiated
of
a
source
for
commercial
irradiation
would
involve
consideration
of
numerous
factors
including
required
dose
rate
load
factor
throughput
convenience
safety
and
most
important
costs
the
potentially
useful
sources
of
ionizing
radiations
gamma
sources
fission
products
or
a
reactor
irradiation
loop
system
using
a
material
such
as
an
indium
salt
have
received
most
attention
for
systems
the
various
particle
accelerators
the
machines
resonant
transformers
and
linear
accelerators
are
the
principal
ones
available
for
commercial
use
of
the
effective
energy
produced
by
these
sources
is
a
major
obstacle
in
the
development
of
processes
production
costs
of
radiation
energy
from
machine
and
nuclide
sources
range
from
to
per
energy
for
processing
foods
is
available
in
the
range
of
at
most
a
few
cents
per
kwhr
for
electric
power
and
the
equivalent
of
a
few
mills
per
kwhr
for
process
steam
therefore
is
at
an
initial
cost
disadvantage
even
though
only
to
per
cent
as
much
radiation
energy
as
heat
energy
is
required
for
radiopasteurization
or
radiosterilization
are
the
possibilities
of
lowered
radiation
production
costs
for
the
future
has
been
estimated
that
for
applications
on
a
megawatt
scale
costs
might
reach
values
in
the
neighborhood
of
cents
per
kwhr
for
accelerators
or
for
gamma
radiation
generated
in
a
reactor
core
comparable
reductions
in
the
cost
of
nuclide
radiation
are
foreseen
projections
however
appear
highly
speculative
and
the
capacities
involved
are
far
beyond
those
foreseen
for
facilities
agricultural
activities
are
seasonal
and
the
areas
of
production
and
harvest
of
many
foods
are
widely
scattered
geographically
and
because
of
the
high
cost
of
transporting
bulk
food
items
any
substantial
distance
to
a
central
processing
location
the
use
of
large
central
processing
stations
where
radiation
facilities
approaching
the
megawatt
range
might
be
utilized
is
inherently
impracticable
status

to

a
wholesome
and

interest

by

in
the
following
paragraphs
radiation

received
extensive
investigation
date
the
one
meat
showing
favorable
results
at
sterilization
doses
is
pork
particular
interest
to
the
military
services
is
the
demonstration
that
roast
pork
after
radiosterilization
is
superior
in
palatability
to
available
canned
pork
products
with
beef
have
been
largely
unsuccessful
because
of
the
development
of
prime
objective
of
the
program
is
to
find
the
reasons
for
low
palatability
and
means
of
overcoming
it
since
it
is
a
major
and
desirable
dietary
item
because
heat
treatment
is
needed
to
inactivate
enzymes
before
radiosterilization
treated
fresh
meats
have
the
appearance
of
boiled
or
canned
meat
is
a
less
severe
problem
with
the
radiopasteurization
of
meats
but
problems
of
commercial
acceptability
remain
radiation
doses
of
from
to
rads
can
extend
the
shelf
life
at
of
fresh
beef
from
days
to
or
weeks
the
problem
of
consumer
acceptability
remains
preradiation
blanching
process
discolors
the
treated
beef
and
liquid
accumulates
in
prepackaged
cuts
beef
irradiated
in
the
absence
of
oxygen
assumes
an
unnatural
pink
color
lamb
and
mutton
are
irradiated
at
substerilization
doses
the
meat
becomes
dehydrated
the
fat
becomes
chalky
and
again
unnatural
changes
in
color
occur
meats
such
as
fresh
pork
sausage
and
hamburger
have
a
relatively
short
shelf
life
under
refrigeration
and
radiopasteurization
might
be
thought
to
offer
distinctly
improved
keeping
qualities
a
major
problem
here
is
one
of
scale
of
processing
ground
meats
are
usually
prepared
from
scrap
meats
at
the
local
level
whereas
irradiation
at
economic
volumes
of
production
would
require
central
processing
and
distribution
facilities
problems
of
color
change
by
blanching
and
liquid
accumulation
within
the
package
are
the
same
as
for
solid
cuts
cooked
items
containing
meat
portions
as
in
frozen
dinners
might
offer
a
potential
use
for
radiopasteurization
principal
potential
advantage
would
be
that
the
finished

could
be
transported
and
stored
at
lower
cost
under

instead
of
being

also
be

of
the

type
processes
for
preserving
meats

it
can

while
the

details
of
the

are
shown
schematically
in

the

shows
that

determine
the

as
well
as
the

occurring
between

will
determine
in
large

the

mechanism
of
the

process
is
difficult
to
measure
the

of

the

in
the
actual

of

by

for

a

of

occur
which
must
be
taken
into
account
and
which
make
the

larger
than
the

of
these
is
the
fact
that
the
knife
employed
no
matter
how

that
the

detailed

of
this

that
the

in
the

of

can
also
be
applied
to

counteracted
the

addition
there
were

if
there
is
to

any
chance
of

by
systematically
varying
the
operating

in
the

stage
and
always
using
the
optimal

for

we
shall
eventually
find
the
optimal

for

in
this
way
from

how

this
economy
is
let
us
suppose
that
there
are
operating
variables
at
each
stage
and
that
the
state
is
specified
by
variables
then
the
search
for
the
maximum
at
any
one
stage
will
require
a
number
of
operations
of
order
where
a

some
number
not
unreasonably
large

from

stage
to
the
next
a
sufficient
number
of

be
investigated
to
allow
for

this
number
will
be
of
the
order
of
however
we
are
seeking
the

only
one

the
final
step

of
the
order

all
the

were
varied
simultaneously
operations
would
be
required
to
do
the
same
job
and
as
increases
this
increases
very
much
more
rapidly
than
the
number
of
operations
required
by
the
dynamic
program
even
more
important
than
this
is
the
fact
that
the
direct
search
by
simultaneously
varying
all
operating
conditions
has
produced
only
one
optimal
policy
namely
that
for
the
given

and
stages
contrast
the
dynamic

produces
this
policy
and
a
whole

of

of

the

using
the
special
features
of
the
problem
to
this
end
the
discrete
deterministic
process
the
process
illustrated
in
consisting
of
distinct
stages
will
be
numbered
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the

of
the

stream
so
that
stage
is
the

from
the
end
the
state
of
the

leaving
stage
be
denoted
by
a
vector
and
the
operating
variables
of
stage
by
denotes
the
state
of

the

and
the
state
of
the
product
from
the
last
stage
stage
transforms
the
state
of
its
feed
to
the
state
in
a
way
that
depends
on
the
operating
variables
write
this
transformation
is
uniquely
determined
by
and
we
therefore
speak
of
the
process
as
deterministic
practical
situations
there
will
be
restrictions
on
the
admissible
operating
conditions
and
we
regard
the
vectors
as
belonging
to
a
fixed

bounded
set
set

constitutes
the

policy
or
more
briefly
the
policy
and
a
policy
is
admissible
if
all
the

been
chosen
the
state
of
the

can
be
obtained
from
the
state
of
the

by
repeated
application
of
the

thus
objective
function
which
is
to
be
maximized
is
some
function
usually
piecewise
continuous
of
the

state
this
be
denoted
by

is
an
admissible
policy
which
maximizes
the
objective
function
policy
may
not
be
unique
but
the
maximum
value
of
certainly
is
and
once
the
policy
is
specified
this
maximum
can
be
calculated
by
and
as
a
function
of
the
feed
state
where
the
maximization
is
over
all
admissible
policies
it
is
necessary
to
be
specific
we
say
that
the
optimal
policy
is
an
optimal
policy
with
respect
to
the
feed
state
any
choice
of
admissible
policy
in
the
first
stage
the
state
of
the
stream
leaving
this

is
given
by
is
the

state
of
the
subsequent
stages
which
according
to
the
principle
of
optimality
must
use
an
optimal
policy
with

to
this
state
will
result
in
a
value
of
the
objective
function
and
when
is
chosen
correctly
this
will
give
the
maximum
of
the
objective
function
where
the

is
over
all

and
is
related
to
by
sequence
of

be
solved
for

clearly
the

is
of

the

enter

find
immediately
from

the

of

up

we
extract
the

and
if
it
is

we
can
check
on
by
evaluating
at
the
last
stage
may
be
that
the
objective
function
depends
not
only
on

also
on
as
when
the

of

that
we
shall
often
have
occasion
to
consider
is

the

the
cost
of
operating
the

with

the

of
the

minus
the
cost
of

that
is
the

the

from

and
then
the
principle
of
optimality
gives
sequence
of
equations
may
be
started
with
the
remark
that
with
no
process
there
is
no
profit
the
discrete
stochastic
process
process
in
which
the
outcome
of
any
one
stage
is
known
only
statistically
is
also
of
interest
although
for
chemical
reactor
design
it
is
not
as
important
as
the
deterministic
process
this
case
the
stage
operating
with
conditions
transforms
the

of
the

from

only
the

specified
by
a

such
that
the

in
some

is
cannot
now
speak
of
maximizing
the

of
the

since
this

is
now
known
only
in
a
probabilistic
sense
can
however
maximize
its
expected
value
a
single

we
may
define
where

have
an

for

we
consider
a

in
which
the
outcome
of
one

is
known
before
passage
to
the

then
the
principle
of

shows
that
the

in

stages
should
be
optimal
with

to
the

of
the

used
here
except
that
now
the

discussion
of
the

when
the

not
known
before
passing

is
a
very
much
more
difficult
matter
the
continuous
deterministic
process
many
cases
it
is
not
possible
to
divide
the
process
into
a
finite
number
of
discrete
stages
since
the

platform
system
using

gyros
is
well
suited
for

because
of
the

operates
with
an
approximate

the

if
a

assumed
that
the
gyros
are
designed
with
electrical
torquers
so
that
a
torque
can
be
applied
about
their

the

shown
in
the

amplified
and
the
resulting
voltage
is
applied
to
the
gyro
torquer
torque
causes
the
entire
system
to
rotate
about

since
the
response
to

are
correct
the

rotates
in
such
a
direction
as
to
reduce
the
accelerometer
output
to
zero
the
accelerometer
output
is
decreasing
the
torque
applied
to
the

decreases
and
therefore
the
rate
decreases
when
the

is
zero
the

these

this

of

to

a

reached
of
the
most

is
achieved
by
the
use
of
a

so
that
its

the

and
is
of
small

in

to
provide
adequate

filtering
effect
is
that
the

returns
from
an

at
a
rapid

until
it
is
nearly

at
which
point
the

so
that

considerations
automatic

system
described
in
this

is
readily
adaptable
to
a

will
hold
the

automatically
as
long
as

useful
of
this

is
that
the

necessary
to

is
available
from
the

necessary
to

leveling
process
can
be
accomplished
manually

the

as

obtained
with

process
consists
in
turning
the

manually
until
the

turning
is
accomplished
by
applying

the

requires
an

high

is
required
in

it
is
usually
necessary
to
integrate

skill
is

on

an
operator
to

a

to
any
degree
of

it
requires
more
time
as
compared
to
the
automatic
approach
leveling
is
inconvenient
if
the

must
be
maintained
accurately

for
any
prolonged

of

operator
must
continually
supply
the

of

to
the

so
that
the
effect
of

is
canceled
process
is
especially
difficult
since
gyro
drifting
is
typically
random
heading
heading
consists
of
orienting
the
sensitive

of
the

parallel
to
the

of

simpler
terms
it
amounts
to

two

to
accomplish
the

the

by

platform
accelerometers
must
be
slightly
modified
for
this
procedure
the
accelerometers
are
mounted
on
the

the

procedure
includes
the
use
of
a

for
the

to
project
a

required
by

to
the
appropriate

this
technique
is
simple
and
satisfactory
one
practical
difficulty
does
exist
the
direction
of
true
north
must
be
known
for
each
launch
point
this
difficulty
is
not
too
serious
if
it
is
realized
that
a
surveying
team
can
establish
a
true
north
base
line
with
a
few
work
many
installations
the
inertial
platform
is
raised
off
the
ground
a
considerable
height
when
it
is
mounted
in
the
vehicle
before
flight
this
situation
it
is
difficult
to
sight
in
on
the
platform
with
surveying
equipment
the
platform
is
not
too
high
off
the
ground
a
transit
can
be
mounted
on
a
stand
to
raise
it
up
to
the
platform
the
heading
accuracy
is
lessened
by
such
techniques
since
errors
are
introduced
because
of

of
the

transit
can
be
replaced
by
an
autocollimator
instrument
provides
an
electrical
signal
proportional
to
the
angular
deviations
of
the
platform
and
can
be
used
to
automatically
hold
the
platform
on
true
heading
electrical
signal
from
the
autocollimator
is
amplified
and
supplied
to
the

the
polarity
is
correct
the
platform
will
turn
until
the

error
angle
is
zero
is
also
available
from
this
autocollimator
system
to
set
the

bias
for
the

the
gyro
is
drifting
a
current
generated
by
the
autocollimator
is
delivered
to
the
gyro
torquer
to
cancel
the
drift
the
drift
error
is
systematic
it
can
be
canceled
with
a
bias
circuit
which
can
be
arranged
and
adjusted
to
supply
the
required
compensating
current
pickoffs
is
possible
to
locate
an
angular

pickoff
which
will
indicate
the

the

heading
alignment
is
an
automatic

system
which
depends
upon
the

the

of

a

off

a

up
with

there
was

discharged
from

after
a
checkup
and
he
and
his
parents
had
what
described
as
a
celebration
lunch
at
the
cafeteria
on
the
campus
wore
a
smart
hat
and
because
she
had
been
warned
recently
about
smoking
puffed
at
her
cigarettes
through
a
long
ivory
holder
stained
with
lipstick
father
sat
sprawled
in
his
chair
angular
alert
as
a
cricket
looking
about
at
the
huge
appointments
of
the
room
with
an
expression
of
proprietorship
men
who
wore
brown
suits
and
had
gray
hair
and
pleasant
smiles
came
to
their
table
to
talk
shop
and
to
be
introduced
to
and
was
polite
indifferent
ate
the
cafeteria
food
with
its
orange
sauces
and
gazed
without
interest
at
his
food
the
teachers
the
heroic
baronial
windows
and
the
bright
ranks
of
college
banners
father
tried
to
make
the
food
a
topic

pie

it
looked
at
his
son
his
face
worried
murmured
thanks
so
softly
his
father
had
to
bend
his
gaunt
height
across
the
table
and
turn
a
round
brown
ear
to
him
regarded
the
ear
and
the
grizzled
hair
around
it
with
a
moment
of
interest
said
more
loudly
full
old

eaten
almost
nothing
on
the
crested

and
had
drunk
about
half
the

in
its

container

right
said

fix
him
something
later
in
the
afternoon
when
we
get
home
his
seizure
had
had
little
appetite
yet
his
changed
appearance
surprisingly
was
one
of
plumpness
face
was
fuller
his
lips
and
the
usually
sharp
lines
of
his
jaw
had
become
breathed
now
with
his
mouth
open
showing
a
whitely
curving
section
of
lower
teeth
he
kept
his
eyes
with
their
puffed
blurred
lids
always
lowered
though
not
apparently
focusing
his
neck
seemed
thicker
and
therefore
shorter
hands
which
had
been
as
quick
as
a
pair
of
fluttering
birds
were
now
neither
active
nor
really
relaxed
lay
on
his
lap
palms
up
stiffly
motionless
the
tapered
fingers
a
little
thick
at
the
joints
he
had
since
the
seizure
the
appearance
of
a
boy
who
overindulged
in
food
and
took
no
exercise
looked
lazy
spoiled
a
little
querulous
had
little
to
say
greeted
her
colleagues
with
smiling
politeness
offering
nothing
for
all
his
sprawling
and
his
easy
familiarity
was
completely
alert
to
his
son
eyes
always
on
the
still
face
jumping
to
anticipate
desires
was
a
strained
silent
lunch
said
better
get
him
to
bed
doctors
had
suggested
remain
most
of
every
afternoon
in
bed
until
he
was
stronger
had
to
give
a
lecture
and
drove
home
alone
in
the
did
not
speak
much
gazed
out
at
ugly
gray
slums
and
said
softly
at
those
stupid
kids
was
a
section
of
peeling
row
houses
churches
and
ragged
children
had
to
bend
toward
and
ask
him
to
repeat
said
then
are
lots
of
kids
around
here
looked
at
the
children
his
mouth
slightly
opened
his
eyes
dull
felt
tired
and
full
and
calm
the
days
seemed
short
perhaps
because
his
routine
was
each
day
almost
the
same
rose
late
and
went
down
in
his
bathrobe
and
slippers
to
have
breakfast
either
alone
or
with
treated
him
with
attention
and
tried
to
tempt
his
appetite
with
special
food
biscuits
cookies
candies
the
result
of
devoted
hours
in
the
tiled
kitchen
would
hover
over
him
and
looking
like
her
brother
anxiously
watch
the
progress
of
fork
or
spoon
eat
enough
honey
to
get
that
down
observing
would
say
has
to
rediscover
his
own
capacity
take
time
and
talked
to
each
other
quietly
now
as
allies
who
are
political
rather
than
natural
might
in
a
war
atmosphere
watched
constantly
without
seeming
to
openly
her
eyes
filled
with
concern
was
neutral
did
not
resent
their
supervision
or
sometimes
tiring
sympathy
ate
what
he
felt
like
slept
as
much
or
as
little
as
he
pleased
and
moved
about
the
draughty
rooms
of
the
house
when
he
was
not
in
bed
with
slow
dubious
steps
like
an
elderly
tourist
in
a
cathedral
energy
was
gone
was
able
now
to
sit
for
hours
in
a
chair
in
the
living
room
and
stare
out
at
the
bleak
yard
without
moving
hands
lay
loosely
yet
stiffly
they
were
like
wax
hands
almost
lifelike
not
quite
folded
in
his
lap
his
mouth
hung
slightly
open
he
was
asked
a
question
or
addressed
in
such
a
way
that
some
response
was
inescapable
he
would
answer
if
as
often
happened
he
had
to
repeat
because
he
had
spoken
too
softly
he
would
repeat
his
words
in
the
same
way
without
emphasis
or
impatience
only
a
little
louder
had
not
mentioned
had
not
even
thought
about
her
much
except
once
or
twice
at
night
in
bed
when
his
slowly
ranging
thoughts
would
abruptly
almost
accidentally
encounter
her
these
times
he
felt
a
kind
of
pain
in
his
upper
chest
but
it
was
an
objective
pain
in
no
way
different
from
others
in
intensity
and
not
different
in
kind
it
was
like
the
bandaged
wound
on
the
back
of
his
head
which
occasionally
throbbed
it
was
merely
another
part
of
his
weakness
was
calm
drugged
and
lazy
did
not
care
mentioned
said
notice
the
girl
from
across
the
street
bothered
to
phone
or
visit
said
all
right
all
right
thought
about
it
briefly
then
deliberately
turned
the
talk
to
something
else
sitting
at
the
front
window
in
his
room
he
saw
come
out
of
her
house
was
with
were
far
off
and
looked
tiny
heavy
branches
in
his
front
yard
would
hide
and
then
reveal
them
turned
at
the
bottom
of
steps
and
moved
off
in
the
direction
of
the
park
thought
he
saw
it
awakened
and
for
a
moment
interested
him
that
held
a
leash
in
her
hand
and
that
a
round
fuzzy
puppy
was
on
the
end
of
the
leash
they
disappeared
and
got
up
and
went
into
his
own
room
and
got
into
bed
the
time
he
was
under
the
covers
he
had
forgotten
about
seeing
doctor
since
was
no
longer
allowed
to
make
his
regular
trips
into
town
to
see
him
came
often
and
informally
to
the
house
would
sit
and
spare
on
the
edge
of
bed
his
legs
crossed
so
elaborately
that
the
crossed
foot
could
tap
the
floor
did
not
mind
the
unsmiling
teasing
as
he
used
to
young
man
he
said
with
mock
distaste
imagine
always
battling
in
school
go
to
school
any
more
doctor
had
to
bend
close
to
hear
his
delicate
hand
as
veined
as
a
wing
rested
absently
on
chest
said
the
same
words
more
loudly
taking
a
little
vacation
all
turned
unsmilingly
to
think
by
the
end
of
next
week
he
could
get
out
in
the
air
a
little
could
now
but
the
weakness
is
very
definite
it
would
exhaust
him
further
and
unnecessarily
be
stronger
soon
stethoscope
was
on
the
table
by
bed
and
he
picked
it
up
and
wagged
it
at
said
fussily
keep
the
cap
on
those
strong
emotions
stethoscope
glinted
silver
in
the

room
drop
by
again
in
a
few
days
stayed
on
after
the
doctor
had
gone
smoothed
the
covers
on
bed
and
picked
things
up
from
the
floor
did
not
touch
him
watched
with
disinterest
did
not
speak
had
no
desire
to
said
you
think
miss
school
had
noticed
how
formal
and
irritably
exact
had
grown
did
not
care
felt
her
irritability
did
not
concern
him
yet
he
knew
he
would
not
care
even
if
it
did
shook
his
head
had
any
number
of
calls
about
you
could
win
a
popularity
contest
at
that
school
without
any
trouble
called
twice
wants
to
pay
you
a
visit
says
the
children
miss
you
you
were
the
light
of
their
lives
shrugged
slightly
came
close
to
the
bed
bent
as
if
she
would
kiss
him
then
moved
away
was
frowning
doctor
annoys
me
seemed
to
speak
to
herself
you
suppose
his
is
characteristic
of
the
new
professionals
or
merely
of
doctors
in
general
turned
to
him
again
has
phoned
too
was
very
worried
tone
was
dry
really
say
glanced
away
at
the
floor
then
swooped
gracefully
and
picked
up
one
of
slippers
mean
do
you
feel
like
seeing
said
know
was
true
did
not
was
the
slight
pain
but
it
was
no
different
from
the
throbbing
in
his
head
time
in
any
case
wait
till
stronger
and
then
talk
about
it
put
the
slipper
neatly
by
its
mate
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
said
time
kissed
him
lightly
on
the
forehead
was
pleased
father
was
a
constant
visitor
would
hear
the
front
door
in
the
evening
and
then
his
deep
slow
voice
it
floated
up
the
stairs
or
reply
better
getting
plenty
of
rest
his
appetite
improved
he
get
exercise
exchange
was
almost
invariable
and
in
his
bed
could
hear
every
word
of
it
never
smiled
required
an
energy
he
no
longer
possessed
to
be
satirical
about
his
father
father
would
come
upstairs
and
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
look
at
his
son
a
pause
during
which
he
studied
face
as
if
were
not
there
and
could
not
study
him
too
would
ask
the
same
questions
he
had
asked
downstairs
would
reply
softly
and
his
father
apologetically
would
ask
him
to
repeat
eating
more
he
would
say
walk
around
the
house
a
lot
you
should
get
out
a
little
not
supposed
to
yet
was
not
irritated
did
not
mind
the
useless
kindly
questions
looked
at
the
lined
face
with
vague
interest
he
felt
he
was
noting
it
as
if
it
were
something
he
might
think
about
when
he
grew
stronger
examined
everything
with
critical
care
seeking
something
material
to
blame
for
his
illness
you
got
enough
blankets
another
time
without
accusation
never
wore
that
scarf
bought
you
their
sharp
edges
seemed
restless
as
sea
waves
thrusting
themselves
upward
in
angry
motion
sat
his
smooth
solidity
his
very
immobility
defying
all
the
turmoil
about
him
objective
the
colonel
had
said
that
day
of
the
briefing
is
the
objective
sat
brooding
over
all
burn
blast
insult
it
as
they
would
could
anyone
really
take
the
ponderous
hulk
and
himself
in
the

over
which
reigned

hidden
high
explosives
booby
traps
and
mines
raped

was
a
pregnant
womb
awaiting
abortion
the
forward
slope
in
front
of
his
own
post
stretched
two
rows
of
barbed
wire
the
base
coils
of
concertina
stretched
out
of
eye
range
like
a
wild
tangle
of
hoops
stopped
simultaneously
weirdly
poised
as
if
awaiting
the
magic
of
the
touch
to
start
them
all
rolling
again
still
regular
barricades
of
barbed
wire
hung
on
timber
supports
it
all
vain
labor
would
clean
up
the
mess
when
the
war
was
over
at
his
quixotic
thoughts
turned
back
from
the
opening
and
lit
a
cigarette
before
sitting
down
a
group
of
men
tomorrow
night
he
himself
would
go
out
there
somewhere
and
wait
he
were
to
go
with
he
would
be
out
there
two
days
not
just
listening
in
the
dark
at
some
point
between
here
and
but
moving
ever
deeper
into
enemy
land
behind
itself
this
what
he
had
expected
realized
that
there
would
be
so
much
time
to
think
so
many
lulls
he
had
forgotten
what
he
must
have
been
told
that
combat
was
an
intermittent
activity
he
knew
that
the
moment
illuminated
by
the
vision
on
the
train
would
have
to
be
approached
could
take
place
tomorrow
night
or
it
might
occur
months
from
now
was
just
too
much
time
to
become
afraid
suggestion
flattered
but
he
did
not
like
the
identity
did
not
spill
over
with
hatred
for
the
enemy
even
seen
him
yet
his
cigarette
out
in
the
earth
walked
to
the
slit
and
scanned
the
jagged
hills
saw
no
life
but
still
stood
there
for
a
time
peering
at
the
unlovely
hills
his
gaze
continually
returning
to
had
come
here
in
order
to
test
himself
most
of
his
beliefs
were
still
unsettled
he
knew
that
he
did
not
believe
in
killing
he
was
here
had
come
because
he
could
not
live
out
his
life

that
he
had
been
a
coward

the

led
out
that
next
night
beaming

carrying
a
machine

another
man
lugged
the

and
a
box
of
ammunition
and
each
carried
in

to
their
own
weapons
and
ammo
a
box
of

extra
clips

at
hours
we

we
pull

nobody

by
looking
at
the
sky

dark

said
that
the

would
be
bounced
off

at
hours

along
the
edge
of
the
stream
which
glowed
in
the
night
their
right
rose
the
embankment
covered
with
brush
and
trees
a
branch
extended
out
too
far
each
man
held
it
back
for
the
next
and
if
they
met
a
low
overhang
each
warned
the
other
stealthily
they
advanced
upstream
then
they
turned
to
the
right
climbed
the
embankment
and
walked
into
the
valley
again
was
no
cover
here
only
grass
sighing
against
with
each
sigh
like
a
whip
in
the
hand
of
an
expert
the
grass
stripped
something
from
gentle
whir
of
each
footstep
left
him
more
naked
than
before
until
he
felt
his
unprotected
flesh
tremble
chilled
by
each
new
sound
shapes
of
the
men
ahead
of
him
lacked
solidity
as
if
the
whip
had
stripped
them
of
their
very
flesh
dark
forms
moved
like
mourners
on
some
nocturnal
pilgrimage
their
dirge
unsung
for
want
of
vocal
chords
warped
broken
trees
in
the
valley
assumed
shapes
of
brush
that
they
passed
were
so
many
enchained
demons
straining
in
anger
to
tear
and
gnaw
on
his
bones
over
all
leered
down
at
him
threatening
a
hundred
hidden
malevolencies
in
the
distance
a
searchlight
flashed
on
its
beam
slashing
the
sky
sharp
ray
was
absorbed
by
a
cloud
then
reflected
to
the
earth
in
a
softer
diffused
radiance
over
there
another
patrol
had
need
of
light
thought
of
all
the
men
out
that
night
who
like
himself
had
left
their
protective
ridge
and
fear
working
at
their
guts
picked
their
way
into
the
area
beyond
the
east
to
the
west
coast
of
the
peninsula
was
a
strip
of
land
in
which
men
were
at
that
same
moment
furtively
crawling
through
the
night
sitting
in
sweaty
anticipation
of
any
movement
or
sound
or
shouting
amidst
confused
rifle
flashes
and
muzzle
blasts
arm
went
up
and
raised
his
own
patrol
was
stopping
came
up
that
spot
over
there
he
whispered
pointing
to
a
small
clump
of
blackness
me
your
machine
gun
ammo
handed
him
the
metal
box
and
quietly
disappeared
down
the
line
in
the
grass
behind
the
brush
clump
looked
about
others
likewise
had
hidden
themselves
in
the
grass
and
the
brush
his
shoulder
he
could
see
with
the
machine
gun
crew
at
this
short
distance
they
were
only
vague
shapes
setting
up
the
machine
gun
on
a
small
knoll
so
that
it
could
fire
above
the
heads
of
the
rest
of
the
patrol
eased
his
safety
off
and
gently
slowly
sneaked
another
clip
of
ammunition
from
one
of
the
cloth
bandoleers
that
marked
the
upper
part
of
his
body
with
an
he
placed
within
quick
reach
walk
and
his
fears
had
served
to
overheat
him
and
his
sweaty
armpits
cooled
at
the
touch
of
the
night
air
the
armored
vest
fitted
the
upper
part
of
his
body
snugly
he
felt
no
security
seemed
to
crouch
in
the
surrounding
dark
in
the
distance
he
saw
a
band
of
men
who
seemed
to
advance
and
retreat
even
as
he
watched
this
menace
was
only
imaginary
he
yet
stared
in
fascinated
horror
his
hand
sticky
against
the
stock
of
his
weapon
was
aware
of
insistent
inner
beatings
as
if
prisoners
within
sought
release
from
his
rigid
body
the
glowing
ivory
baton
of
their
searchlight
pointed
at
the
clouds
diluting
the
dark
to
a
pallid
light
the
figures
which
held
his
attention
became
a
group
of
shattered
trees
standing
like
the
grotesques
of
a
medieval
damnation
scene
so
he
could
not
ease
the
tension
of
his
body
the
rough
surface
of
the
earth
itself
seemed
to
resist
every
attempt
on
his
part
to
relax
the
unseen
presence
of
the
other
men
in
the
patrol
he
felt
mutely
united
to
these
nine
sharing
this
pinpoint
of
being
with
him
sensed
something
precious
in
the
perilous
moment
something
akin
to
the
knowledge
gained
on
his
bicycle
trip
through
the
countryside
a
knowledge
imprisoned
in
speechlessness
he
had
puzzled
the
meaning
of
the
great
stone
monuments
men
had
thrown
up
to
the
sky
and
always
as
he
wandered
he
felt
a
stranger
to
their
exultation
were
poems
in
a
strange
language
of
which
he
could
barely
touch
a
meaning
enough
to
make
his
being
ache
with
the
desire
for
the
fullness
he
sensed
there
that
mystery
through
which
he
traveled
for
thirty
days
sleeping
in
the
barns
of
farmers
or
alongside
roads
had
worked
some
subtle
change
in
him
he
knew
and
it
was
in
that
he
had
met
had
no
hands
they
had
been
severed
at
the
wrists
leather
cups
fitted
in
his
handlebars
he
steered
his
bicycle
and
had
traveled
together
for
four
days
visited
the
shipyards
at
and
had
to
sign
the
register
vouching
for
the
integrity
of
the
visiting
foreigner
took
the
pen
in
his
stumps
and
began
to
write
the
guard
who
ran
from
the
hut
to
shout
to
other
men
standing
about
outside
crowded
the
small
room
and
peered
over
one
shoulders
to
watch
the
handless
man
write
his
name
in
the
book
formidable
they
exclaimed
oui
merveilleux
then
the
questions
came
eager
interested
questions
and
many
compliments
on
his
having
overcome
his
infirmity
it
ever
bother
you
had
asked
to
have
people
always
asking
you
about
your
hands
the
are
a
very
curious
people
had
laughed
are
also
honest
seekers
after
truth
the
are
painfully
silent
about
my
missing
hands
refuse
to
mention
or
to
notice
that
they
are
not
there
like
yourself
take
the
fact
for
granted
try
to
be
helpful
but
ask
questions
used
to
all
three
but
think
the
have
the
healthiest
attitude
was
the
day
that
had
told
about
the
of
are
looking
tired
and
there
you
can
rest
will
be
good
for
you
think
too
he
said
his
dark
eyes
mischievous
that
you
will
find
there
some
clue
to
the
secret
of
the
cathedrals
about
which
you
have
spoken
two
weeks
was
ringing
the
bell
at
the
abbey
gate
monk
who
opened
the
door
immediately
calmed
his
worries
about
his
reception
speak
the
old
man
said
but
do
not
hear
it
very
well
smiled
and
stuck
a
large
finger
with
white
hairs
sprouting
on
it
into
his
ear
as
though
that
might
help
at
protestations
the
old
monk
took
his
grip
from
him
and
led
him
down
a
corridor
to
a
small
parlor
you
please
wait
in
here
sat
over
his
second
in
a
little
bar
next
to
the
funeral
parlor
on
was
small
dark
narrow
and
filled
with
the
mingled
scent
of
beer
tobacco
smoke
and
cooking
over
the
bar
was
an
oil
painting
of
a
nude

accepted
from
a
student
at
the
who
needed
to
eat
and
drink
and
was
broke
nude
was
small
and
and
elfin
and
was
called
was
one
place
where
could
go
for
a
drink
in
a
back
booth
without
anyone
noticing
him
or
at
least
coming
up
and
hanging
around
and
wanting
to
know
all
the
other
patrons
were
taxi
drivers
and
art
students
and
small
shopkeepers
reporters
had
not
yet
discovered
that
this
was
his
hideaway
friend
was
with
him
was
wise
enough
to
realize
a
man
could
be
good
company
even
if
he
did
weigh
too
much
and
own
the
mint
was
the
widow
of
a
writer
who
had
died
in
an
airplane
crash
and
had
found
her
a
job
as
head
of
the
historical
section
of
the

sorting
out

clippings
and
the
like
sat
receptive
and
interested
had
a
pleasant
glow
as
he
said

both
of
them

are
romantics
romantic
is
one
who
thinks
the
world
is
divinely
inspired
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
find
the
right
key
and
then
divine
justice
and
altruism
will
appear
like
focusing
a
camera
the
distant
ship
there
until
you
get
the
focus
know
what
talking
about
sure
all
girls
feel
this
way
about
men
until
they
live
with
them
when
it
comes
to
war
the

what
it
is
and
knows
that
a
soldier
will
get
the
for
conduct
that
would
land
him
in
prison
for
life
or
the
electric
chair
as
a
civilian

a
mean
unbroken
sheer
bastard
in
his
outfit
and
someone
invented
the
name
for
him
to
say
he
was

happy

at
anything
if
it
was
the
rear
end
of
a
horse
or
his
own
sentry
was
a
wiry
inscrutable
silent
country
boy
from
the
red
clay
of
rural
and
he
spoke
with
the
broad
drawl
that
others
normally
make
fun
of
not
in
front
of
heard
of
some
that
tried
it
back
in

pretty
bad
incident
back
at
the
base

a
refugee
from
one
of

fun
of

drew
a
knife

a
concussion
and
was
cut
up
badly
caught
stealing
liquor
from
the
mess
and
he
got
a
couple
of
girls
in
trouble
fear
of
punishment
just
bother
him
there
was
left
out
of
him
at
birth
is
why
he
made
such
a
magnificent
soldier
troubled
with
the
ordinary
fear
that
overcomes
and
paralyzes
and
sends
individual
soldiers
and
whole
companies
under
fire
running
in
panic
just
occur
to
that
anything
serious
would
happen
to
him
you
get
the
picture
of
the
kind
of
fellow
he
was
nodded
with
a
pleasant
smile
right
was
a
nest
in
a
mountain
cave
and
it
was
picking
off
our
men
with
devilish
accuracy
ordered
that
it
be
wiped
out
and
suggested
ask
for
volunteers
and
promise
each
man
on
the
patrol
a
quart
of
whisky
ten
dollars
and
a
pass
to
was
one
of
the
five
volunteers
patrol
snaked
around
in
back
of
the
cave
approached
it
from
above
and
dropped
in
suddenly
with
wild
howls
could
hear
them
from
our
outpost
was
a
lot
of
shooting
knew
the
enemy
was
subdued
because
a
flare
was
fired
as
the
signal
we
hurried
over
of
our
men
were
killed
a
third
was
wounded
and
a
very
black
colored
boy
from
had
killed
or
put
out
of
action
ten
guerrillas
by
grenades
and
fighting
we
got
there
and
the
were
quarreling
over
possession
of
a
gold
crucifix
around
the
neck
of
a
wounded
colored
boy
had
it
and
lunged
at
him
with
a
knife
and
said
that
to
me
you
black
bastard
nigras
to
walk
on
the
same
sidewalk
with
white
men
where
come
from
got
a
bad
slice
on
his
chest
from
the
knife
wound
did
the
do
about
the
men
asked
in
her
placid
interested
way
laughed
recommended
both
of
them
for
the
and
the
fellow
for
the
too
for
a
wound
you
see
knows
what
all
about
not
he
was
in
the
war
he
was
in
or
or
something
like
that
and
an
old
buddy
of
his
told
me
he
would
come
down
on
to
the
and
read
the
citations
for
medals
just
like
the
one
we
sent
in
for
and
go
away
with
a
real
glow
were
heroes
nine
feet
tall
to
him
was
alone
at
the
small
perfectly
appointed
table
by
the
window
looking
out
over
the
river
had
dinner
and
sat
there
over
his
coffee
watching
the
winding
pattern
of
traffic
as
it
crossed
the
bridge
and
spread
out
like
a
serpent
with
two
heads
him
was
thought
how
this
dainty
fragile
older
woman
threading
her
way
through
the
streets
of
on
a
day
in
enjoying
the
flowers
in
the
shops
the
greetings
from
old
friends
but
never
really
drawing
a
deep
passionate
breath
was
so
like
himself
and
too
had
never
permitted
themselves
the
luxury
of
joys
that
dug
into
the
bone
marrow
of
the
spirit
had
not
because
he
was
both
poor
and
ambitious
imposes
a
kind
of
chastity
on
the
ambitious
cannot
stop
to
grasp
and
embrace
and
sit
in
the
back
seat
of
cars
along
a
dark
country
lane
they
must
look
the
other
way
and
climb
one
more
painful
step
up
the
ladder
made
the
decision
with
his
eyes
open
or
so
he
thought
any
cost
he
must
leave
the
dreary
mining
town
where
his
father
was
a
pharmacist
so
he
had
so
he
had
he
had
no
time
to
walk
among
the
violets
on
the
edge
his
room
he
could
look
out
in
springtime
and
see
the
couples
hand
in
hand
walking
slowly
deliciously
across
the
campus
and
he
could
smell
the
sweet
vernal
winds
was
not
stone
was
not
unmoved
had
to
teach
himself
patiently
that
these
traps
were
not
for
him
must
mentally
pull
the
blinds
and
close
the
window
so
that
all
that
existed
was
in
the
books
before
him
law
school
the
same
of
this
stamping
down
of
human
emotion
as
a
young
lawyer
in
the
time
he
was
prosperous
enough
his
goals
were
high
he
was
bald
and
afraid
of
women
only
one
who
would
have
him
was
his
cripple
the
strange
unhappy
woman
who
became
his
wife
it
was
right
perhaps
it
was
just
had
dared
to
defy
nature
to
turn
his
back
to
the
and
he
was
punished
with
her
regrets
about
he
had
his
moments
of
melancholy
over
a
youth
too
well
spent
he
had
had
a
son
he
would
tell
him
ye
rosebuds
while
ye
may
same
flower
that
smiles
today
tomorrow
will
be
dying
then
his
son
could
afford
it
was
waiting
for
had
called
and
asked
if
he
could
see
the
at
his
home
said
the
matter
was
urgent
was
uneasy
about
the
visit
did
not
like
suspected
something
underhanded
and
furtive
about
him
could
not
put
his
finger
on
it
precisely
and
this
worried
him
you
disliked
or
distrusted
a
man
you
should
have
a
reason
nature
was
not
a
piece
of
meat
you
could
tell
was
bad
by
its
smell
stared
a
minute
at
the
lighted
ribbon
of
traffic
hoping
that
a
clue
to
his
dislike
of
the
would
appear
did
not
he
decided
he
was
unfair
to
the
young
man
and
should
make
an
effort
to
understand
and
sympathize
with
his
point
of
view
half
hour
later
the
arrived
looked
very
carefully
at
every
piece
of
furnishing
as
though
hoping
to
store
this
information
carefully
in
his
mind
observed
the
vase
in
the
hall
the
painting
in
the
library
as
well
as
the
long
shelves
of
volumes
the
pattern
of
the
rug
the
delicate
chandelier
said
to
the
understand
you
came
from
a
little
town
near
did
you
find
out
about
this
waved
his
arm
around
at
the
furnishings
was
not
a
discourteous
question
decided
young
man
had
so
little
time
to
learn
he
had
to
be
curious
he
had
to
find
out
did
not
tell
him
at
what
cost
at
what
loneliness
he
learned
these
things
merely
said
good
decorator
these
days
can
make
you
a
tasteful
home
said
you
hear
of
any
names
that
would
fix
me
cheap
in
return
for
advertising
they
decorated
the
home
let
me
know
can
do
business
with
that
kind
thought
a
little
sadly
these
were
the
fees
of
poverty
and
ambition
did
not
have
the
chance
to
grow
up
graciously
had
to
acquire
everything
he
was
going
to
get
in
four
years
had
brandy
in
the
library
looked
at
with
a
searching
glance
the
kind
that
a
prosecuting
attorney
would
give
a
man
on
trial
are
your
weaknesses
will
you
break
best
to
destroy
your
peace
said
with
a
slight
bluster
anyone
who
loves
the
more
than
do
is
my
ideal
the
same
time
you
have
to
face
facts
and
realize
that
a
man
been
in
the
all
his
life
understand
much
about
politics
does
a
monk
know
about
sex
listened
with
the
practiced
deceptive
calm
of
the
lawyer
but
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
we
have
to
protect
the
old
man
for
his
own
good
see
what
mean
is
full
of
politicians
and
if
you
want
to
get
along
with
them
you
have
to
be
politic
is
why
say
we
just
go
ahead
and
disarm
the
and
pull
down
our
own
defenses
me
tell
you
what
happened
to
me
today
fellow
came
up
to
me
a
have
to
tell
you
his
name
and
he
told
me
love
the
like
a
brother
but
damn
it
crucifying
me
got
a
quarter
of
a
million
in
my
state
and
those
krautheads

not

said
quite
calmly
go
and
see
what
like
was
about
miles
west
of
near
the
border
and
on
the
a
small
and
dirty
stream
city
was
a
center
of
manufacture
especially
in
textiles
and
also
because
of
the
beauty
of
some
of
its
surroundings
a
residence
for
many
owners
of
the
great
industries
in
north
it
had
as
was
usual
in
southern
cities
of
this
sort
a
a
low
region
near
the
river
where
the
lived
servants
and
laborers
huddled
together
in
a
region
with
no
sewage
save
the
river
where
streets
and
sidewalks
were
neglected
and
where
there
was
much
poverty
and
crime
came
by
train
from
and
looked
the
city
over
the
rather
pleasant
white
city
was
on
the
hill
where
the
chief
stores
were
were
industries
and
factories
they
went
down
to
the
midst
of
this
crowded
region
was
the
was
an
old
and
dirty
wooden
structure
sadly
in
need
of
repair
it
was
a
landmark
had
been
there
years
or
more
and
everybody
in
town
black
and
white
knew
of
it
had
just
suffered
a
calamity
the
final
crisis
in
a
long
series
of
calamities
the
old
preacher
who
had
been
there
years
was
dead
and
the
city
mourned
him
was
a
man
once
vigorous
but
for
many
years
now
declining
in
strength
and
ability
was
stern
and
overbearing
with
his
flock
but
obsequious
and
conciliatory
with
the
whites
especially
the
rich
who
partly
supported
the
church
headed
by
a
black
man
named
had
practically
taken
over
as
the
pastor
grew
old
and
had
its
way
with
the
support
of
the
corner
characteristic
thing
about
this
church
was
its
corner
and
the
weekly
religious
orgy
knot
of
old
worshippers
chiefly
women
listened
weekly
to
a
sermon
began
invariably
in
low
tones
almost
conversational
and
then
gradually
worked
up
to
high
shrill
appeals
to
and
man
then
the
corner
took
hold
a
form
of
group
participation
in
worship
that
stemmed
from
years
before
the
chorus
spreading
down
through
the
forest
overseas
to
the
and
then
here
in
shout
and
slow
dance
with
tears
and
song
with
scream
and
contortion
the
corner
group
was
beset
by
hysteria
and
shivering
wailing
shouting
possession
of
something
that
seemed
like
an
alien
and
outside
force
spread
to
most
of
the
audience
and
was
often
viewed
by
visiting
whites
who
snickered
behind
handkerchief
and
afterward
discussed
religion
sometimes
ended
in
trances
with
many
lying
exhausted
and
panting
on
chair
and
floor
most
of
those
who
composed
the
corner
it
was
a
magnificent
and
beautiful
experience
something
for
which
they
lived
from
week
to
week
was
often
in
less
wild
form
at
the
night
prayer
meeting
on
his
first
witnessed
this
with
something
like
disgust
had
preached
a
short
sermon
trying
to
talk
to
the
audience
to
tell
them
who
he
was
what
he
had
done
in
and
and
what
he
proposed
to
do
here
sympathized
with
them
on
the
loss
of
their
old
pastor
then
at
mention
of
that
name
the
corner
broke
loose
had
no
chance
to
say
another
word
the
very
end
when
the
audience
was
silent
and
breathless
a
collection
was
taken
and
then
slowly
everyone
filed
out
audience
did
not
think
much
of
the
new
pastor
and
what
the
new
pastor
thought
of
the
audience
he
did
not
dare
at
the
time
to
say
the
next
weeks
he
looked
over
the
situation
of
all
there
was
the
parsonage
an
utterly
impossible
place
for
civilized
people
to
live
in
originally
poorly
conceived
apparently
not
repaired
for
years
with
no
plumbing
or
sewage
with
and
rot
was
arranged
that
he
would
board
in
the
home
of
one
of
the
old
members
of
the
church
a
woman
named
who
as
afterward
found
was
briefly
referred
to
as
because
of
her
sharp
tongue
and
fierce
initiative
was
a
lonely
devoted
soul
never
married
conducting
a
spotless
home
and
devoted
to
her
church
but
a
perpetual
dissenter
and
born
critic
soared
over
the
new
pastor
like
an
avenging
angel
lest
he
stray
from
the
path
and
not
know
all
the
truth
and
gossip
of
which
she
was
chief
repository
looked
over
the
church
and
studied
its
condition
salary
of
the
pastor
had
for
years
been
annually
and
even
this
was
in
arrears
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
receive
at
least
but
when
he
mentioned
this
to
the
they
said
nothing
church
itself
must
be
repaired
was
dirty
and
neglected
really
ought
to
be
rebuilt
and
he
determined
to
go
up
and
talk
to
the
city
banks
about
this
the
city
itself
should
be
talked
to
streets
in
the
colored
section
were
dirty
was
typhoid
and
malaria
children
had
nowhere
to
go
and
no
place
to
play
not
even
sidewalks
school
was
small
dark
and
teacher
was
a
pliant
fool
were
two
liquor
saloons
not
very
far
from
the
church
one
white
that
is
conducted
for
white
people
with
a
side
entrance
for
the
other
exclusively
there
was
a
good
deal
of
gambling
in
both
the
other
side
of
the
church
was
a
quiet
house
with
shutters
and
recently
painted
inquired
about
it
was
called
deacon
of
the
church
was
its
janitor
of
the
leading
members
of
the
corner
was
cook
there
were
two
or
three
colored
maids
employed
there
was
told
that
it
was
a
sort
of
hotel
for
white
people
which
seemed
to
him
rather
queer
should
a
white
hotel
be
set
down
in
the
center
of
nevertheless
it
looked
respectable
was
glad
to
have
it
there
rest
of
was
a
rabbit
warren
of
homes
in
every
condition
of
neglect
disrepair
and
careful
upkeep
carefully
repaired
huts
and
nicely
painted
and
ornamented
cottages
were
jumbled
together
cheek
by
jowl
with
little
distinction
best
could
not
escape
from
the
worst
and
the
worst
nestled
cosily
beside
the
better
yards
front
and
back
were
narrow
some
were
trash
dumps
some
had
flower
gardens
were
privies
for
there
was
no
sewage
system
looking
about
a
bit
discovered
beyond
across
the
river
and
far
removed
from
the
white
city
a
considerable
tract
of
land
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
church
and
the
better
homes
might
gradually
be
moved
to
this
plot
talked
about
it
to
the
looked
him
over
rather
carefully
was
not
sure
what
kind
of
a
man
he
had
in
hand
there
was
one
thing
that
he
had
to
stress
and
that
was
that
the
contribution
to
the
general
church
expenses
the
dollar
money
had
been
seriously
falling
behind
in
this
church
and
that
must
be
looked
after
immediately
fact
he
intimated
clearly
that
that
was
the
reason
that
had
been
sent
here
to
make
a
larger
contribution
of
dollar
money
stressed
the
fact
that
clear
as
this
was
they
must
have
a
better
church
a
more
conduct
of
the
church
organization
and
an
effort
to
get
this
religious
center
out
of
its
rut
of
wild
worship
into
a
modern
church
organization
emphasized
to
the
the
plan
of
giving
up
the
old
church
and
moving
across
the
river
was
sure
that
that
would
be
impossible
he
told
to
go
ahead
and
try
tried
did
seem
impossible
bank
which
held
the
mortgage
on
the
old
church
declared
that
the
interest
was
considerably
in
arrears
and
the
real
estate
people
said
flatly
that
the
land
across
the
river
was
being
held
for
an
eventual
development
for
white
working
people
who
were
coming
in
and
that
none
would
be
sold
to
colored
folk
it
was
proposed
to
rebuild
the
church
found
that
the
terms
for
a
new
mortgage
were
very
high
was
sure
that
he
could
do
better
if
he
went
to
to
get
the
deal
financed
when
this
proposal
was
made
to
his
he
met
unanimous
opposition
church
certainly
would
not
be
removed
very
proposition
was
sacrilege
had
been
here
fifty
years
was
going
to
stay
forever
was
hardly
possible
to
get
any
argument
on
the
subject
for
rebuilding
well
that
might
be
looked
into
but
there
was
no
hurry
no
hurry
at
all
again
went
downtown
to
a
different
banker
an
intelligent
young
white
man
who
seemed
rather
sympathetic
but
he
shook
his
head
he
said
think
you
quite
understand
the
situation
here
you
see
the
amount
of
money
that
has
been
invested
by
whites
around
that
church
stores
saloons
some
gambling
hope
not
too
much
colored
people
are
getting
employment
at
and
other
places
and
they
are
near
their
places
of
employment
a
city
has
arranged
things
like
this
you
cannot
easily
change
them
if
were
you
would
just
plan
to
repair
the
old
church
so
it
would
last
for
five
or
ten
years
that
time
perhaps
something
better
can
be
done
asked
about
this
which
you
mention
understand
why
a
white
hotel
should
be
down
here
young
banker
looked
at
him
with
a
certain
surprise
and
then
he
said
flatly
afraid
tell
you
anything
in
particular
about
have
to
find
out
about
it
on
your
own
to
see
you
again
he
dismissed
the
colored
pastor
was
next
day
that
came
and
sat
beside
him
and
took
his
hand
said
dear
do
you
know
what
is
said
was
just
asking
about
it
is
it
a
house
of
prostitution
for
white
men
with
white
girls
as
inmates
hire
a
good
deal
of
local
labor
including
two
members
of
our
buy
some
supplies
from
our
colored
grocers
and
they
are
patronized
by
some
of
the
best
white
gentlemen
in
town
stared
at
her
dear
you
must
be
mistaken
to
she
said
after
had
talked
to
and
to
others
he
was
absolutely
amazed
of
course
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
used
to
take
place
in
cities
putting
white
houses
of
prostitution
with
colored
girls
in
colored
neighborhoods
and
carrying
them
on
openly
it
had
largely
disappeared
on
account
of
protest
by
the
whites
and
through
growing
resentment
on
the
part
of
the
as
they
became
more
educated
and
got
better
wages
this
situation
of
was
more
subtle
wages
involved
were
larger
and
more
regular
inmates
were
white
and
from
out
of
town
avoiding
local
friction
backing
from
the
white
town
was
greater
and
there
was
little
publicity
wages
patronage
and
subscription
of
various
kinds
stopped
open
protest
from
yet
knew
that
this
place
must
go
or
he
must
go
for
him
to
leave
this
job
now
without
accomplishing
anything
would
mean
practically
the
end
of
his
career
in
the
church
if
not
in
all
churches
dismounted
in
and
handed
the
reins
to

a
fog
which
increased
the
darkness
of
the

have
another

outside

was
an
ordinary
enough
house
of
the
gentry
clomped
heavily
up
the
stoop
and
rang
the
bell
the
bell
at
the
doorbell
was
pitched

high

after
all

boy
opened
the
door
did
not
notice
him
was
thinking
chiefly
of
their
schedules
were
to
synchronize
there
was
no
point
in
wasting
time
pushed
his
way
inside
a
moment
the
hall
confused
him
was
the
largest
house
he
had
ever
been
in
almost
the
largest
building
except
for
a
hotel
had
no
idea
where
room
would
be
the
half
darkness
the
banisters
gleamed
and
the
hall
seemed
enormous
him
somewhere
were
the
bedrooms
would
be
up
there
explained
his
errand
but
without
bothering
much
to
make
it
plausible
for
he
felt
something
well
up
in
him
which
was
the
reason
why
he
had
fled
the
army
did
not
really
want
to
kill
but
as
in
the
sexual
act
there
was
a
moment
when
the
impulse
took
over
and
could
not
be
downed
even
while
you
watched
yourself
giving
way
to
it
was
no
longer
worried
would
be
all
right
knew
that
in
this
mood
he
could
not
be
stopped
the
sensation
always
surprised
him
was
a
thrill
he
felt
no
part
in
could
only
watch
with
a
sort
of
gentle
dismay
while
his
body
did
these
quick
appalling
and
efficient
things
brushed
by
the
idiotic
boy
and
lumbered
heavily
up
the
stairs
were
carpeted
but
made
for
pumps
and
congress
gaiters
not
the
great
clodhoppers
he
wore
sound
of
his
footsteps
was
like
a
muffled
drum
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
ran
into
somebody
standing
there
angrily
in
a
dressing
gown
stopped
and
whispered
his
errand
held
out
his
hand
a
little
shook
his
head
had
told
him
to
deliver
his
package
in
person
said
his
father
was
sleeping
and
then
went
through
a
pantomime
at
his
door
to
prove
the
statement
well
said
will
go
smiled
but
now
that
he
knew
where
the
elder
was
he
did
not
intend
to
go
pulled
out
his
pistol
and
fired
it
made
no
sound
had
misfired
it
he
smashed
the
butt
down
on
head
over
and
over
again
was
the
first
blow
that
was
always
difficult
that
violence
was
exultantly
easy
got
caught
up
into
it
and
became
a
different
person
afterwards
did
an
act
like
that
become
meaningless
so
that
he
would
puzzle
over
it
for
days
whereas
at
the
time
it
had
seemed
quite
real
nigger
boy
fled
down
the
stairs
screaming
was
not
murder
at
all
was
more
methodical
than
that
was
merely
clearing
a
way
to
what
he
had
to
do
ran
for
the
sick
room
found
his
pistol
was
broken
and
threw
it
away
knife
would
do
childhood
he
had
known
all
about
knives
blocked
the
door
from
inside
smashed
it
in
and
tumbled
into
darkness
saw
only
dimly
moving
figures
but
when
he
slashed
them
they
yelled
and
fled
went
for
the
bed
jumped
on
it
and
struck
where
he
could
repeatedly
was
like
finally
getting
into
own
nightmares
to
punish
dreams
men
pulled
him
off
said
anything
hacked
at
their
arms
was
a
lady
there
in
a
nightdress
would
not
have
wanted
to
hurt
a
lady
man
approached
this
one
fully
dressed
the
knife
went
into
his
chest
he
went
down
at
once
mad
shouted
as
he
ran
out
into
the
hall
mad
and
only
wished
he
had
been
would
have
made
things
so
much
easier
he
was
not
mad
was
only
dreaming
clattered
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
door
in
the
fog
the
nigger
boy
was
still
yelling
murder
always
wakes
up
even
from
own
dreams
clammy
air
revived
him
he
saw
had
fled
one
did
not
expect
much
of
people
like
unhitched
his
horse
walked
it
away
mounted
and
spurred
it
on
nigger
boy
was
close
behind
him
the
nigger
boy
turned
back
and
he
was
alone
rode
on
and
on
had
no
idea
where
he
was
some
time
he
came
to
an
open
field
open
field
was
better
than
a
building
that
was
for
sure
so
he
dismounted
turned
off
the
horse
and
plunged
through
the
grass
felt
curiously
sleepy
the
world
seemed
far
away
he
knew
he
should
get
to
but
he
know
how
was
sure
for
he
had
done
as
he
was
told
he
would
find
him
and
take
care
of
him
choosing
a
good
tree
he
clambered
up
into
it
found
a
comfortable
notch
and
curled
up
in
it
to
sleep
like
the
tousled
bear
he
was
with
his
hands
across
his
chest
as
though
surfeited
with
honey
always
made
him
tired
but
he
was
not
frightened
was
winding
up
a
performance
of
was
a
part
so
familiar
to
him
that
he
did
not
bother
to
think
about
it
any
more
soothed
him
a
stage
he
always
knew
what
to
do
and
tonight
to
judge
by
the
applause
he
must
be
doing
it
better
than
usual
how
often
had
he
had
to
play
that
part
who
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
he
raised
his
arm
and
declaimed
is
my
honour
now
was
one
of
the
high
spots
of
the
play
audience
as
usual
loved
it
was
delighted
to
see
them
so
happy
he
had
any
worries
it
was
only
the
small
ones
about
in
and
his
daughter
and
what
she
might
be
doing
at
this
hour
with
her
in
is
ambivalent
about
his
profession
if
he
has
practised
it
long
enough
but
there
were
still
moments
when
he
loved
the
stage
and
all
those
unseen
people
out
there
who
might
cheer
you
or
boo
you
but
that
was
largely
though
not
entirely
up
to
you
made
the
world
seem
friendly
somehow
though
he
knew
it
was
not
was
quite
right
about
one
thing
had
been
in
the
green
room
commotion
had
brought
her
into
the
wings
she
could
not
act
one
part
suited
her
as
well
as
any
other
and
so
she
was
the
first
person
to
offer
a
glass
of
water
holding
it
up
to
the
box
high
above
her
head
to
who
had
asked
for
it
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
collect
her
wits
was
not
so
much
that
the
shot
had
stunned
the
audience
as
that
they
had
been
stunned
already
of
them
had
seen
before
and
unless
was
on
stage
there
was
not
much
to
it
theatre
was
hot
and
they
were
drugged
with
boredom
stage
had
been
empty
except
for
doing
his
star
monologue
audience
was
fond
of
he
was
a
dear
in
or
out
of
character
but
he
was
not
particularly
funny
the
end
of
the
monologue
the
audience
would
applaud
it
looked
at
the
scenery
guess
know
enough
to
turn
you
inside
out
you
sockdologizing
old
mantrap
otherwise
was
always
a
pause
here
before
the
next
line
was
when
the
gun
went
off
even
that
explosion
did
not
mean
much
were
going
off
all
over
these
days
because
of
the
celebrations
and
the
theatre
was
not
soundproof
the
audience
saw
a
small
dim
figure
appear
at
the
edge
of
the
box
semper
tyrannis
it
said
mildly
had
delivered
his
line
him
billowed
a
small
pungent
cloud
of
smoke
strained
forward
had
not
heard
what
had
been
said
had
been
sitting
too
long
to
be
able
to
stand
up
easily
figure
leapt
from
the
box
almost
lost
its
balance
the
flag
draped
there
tore
in
the
air
the
figure
landed
on
its
left
leg
fell
on
its
hands
and
pressed
itself
up
still
had
his
arm
raised
towards
the
wings
speech
faltered
did
not
lower
his
arm
figure
was
so
theatrically
dressed
that
it
was
as
though
a
character
from
some
other
play
had
blundered
into
this
one
play
for
night
was
to
be
a
benefit
performance
of
figure
looked
like
the
slave
dealer
from
that
it
also
looked
like
a
toad
hopping
away
from
the
light
was
something
maimed
and
crazy
about
its
motion
that
disturbed
them
it
disappeared
into
the
wings
had
not
shifted
position
but
he
at
last
lowered
his
arm
screamed
was
no
mistaking
that
scream
was
what
anyone
who
had
ever
seen
her
had
always
expected
her
to
do
this
scream
had
a
different
note
in
it
absence
of
an
urgent
dashed
them
awake
like
a
pail
of
water
one
of
the
guests
in
the
box
stood
up
and
demanded
water
action
was
involuntary
something
unexpected
happened
one
always
asked
for
water
if
one
were
a
woman
brandy
if
one
were
a
man
screamed
again
the
box
someone
leaned
over
the
balustrade
and
yelled
has
shot
the
got
everybody
up
the
stage
began
to
weep
brushed
by
him
with
the
glass
of
water
crowd
began
to
move
everyone
lived
in
a
bubble
of
plots
and
one
death
might
attract
another
was
not
exactly
panic
they
gave
way
to
but
they
could
not
just
sit
there
beehive
voices
for
no
one
could
bear
silence
drowned
out
the
sound
of
weeping
the
rear
of
the
auditorium
upstairs
some
men
tried
to
push
open
the
door
to
the

not

up
on
the

and
got
the
actors
to
hoist
him
up
to
the
box
the
audience
a
man
named
lost
his
head
and
tried
to
rescue
a
little
girl
from
the
mob
on
the
same
principle
which
had
led
to
demand
water
opened
the
corridor

from
the
inside
and
called
for
a
doctor

forced
through
the
mob
and
squeezed
out
into

dingy
corridor

straight
to
the
box

lost
her
head
but
nobody
blamed
her
for
doing
so
now
was
a

about

collapsed
in

retaining
his

and
now
wickedly
he
compelled
her
to
bring
her
hooves
down
again
and
again
upon
the
sprawled
figure
of
the
stranger

feel
his
own
feet
striking
repeatedly

the
body
was
limp
gloated

his
lips
slavered

himself
chortling

around

none
of

not

at

to
him

was
something
troubling
him
though
as
yet
they
days
twinges
of
annoyance
ran
through
him
eyes
blinked
hard
snapping
on
and
squashing
some
bad
things
that
were
trying
to
push
their
way
into
him
tune
began
to
whirl
inside
his
head
of
his
favorites
always
came
on
faithfully
just
like
a
radio
or
juke
box
whenever
he
started
to
worry
too
much
about
something
when
the
bad
things
tried
to
push
their
way
into
him
music
drove
them
off
or
away
and
he
was
free
to
walk
on
air
in
a
very
few
moments
humming
and
jiving
within
beating
the
rhythm
within
glowed
with
anticipation
about
what
would
happen
to
the
culprits
when
they
caught
them
the
bastards
over
to
me
to
me
and
my
boys
no

ever
got
what

be
comin
to
them
reactionary
bastards
had
never
heard
the
word
reactionary
before
his
life
as
a
began
was
a
word
he
was
proud
of
a
word
that
meant
much
to
him
and
he
used
it
with
great
pleasure
almost
as
if
it
were
an
exclusive
possession
and
more
he
sensed
himself
to
be
very
highly
educated
four
cuts
above
any
of
the
folks
back
home
cuts
at
least
he
chuckled
to
himself
and
owe
it
all
to
them
word
also
made
him
feel
hate
sincere
hate
for
those
so
labeled
used
it
very
effectively
when
he
wanted
to
get
his
squad
on
the
ball
came
up
again
and
again
in
the
discussion
sessions

that
that
heard

himself
before

delivering
the
speech
laughed
suddenly
feeling
a
surge
of
power
telling
him
of
his
hold
over
them
seeing
himself
before
them
receiving
utmost
respect
and
attention
day
had
told
him
smiling
patting
him
on
the
back
as
they
walked
to
the
weekly
conference

said
aloud
spitting
on
them
halted
and
looked
around
of
cold
sweat
were
suddenly
unleashed
within
him
thought
came
back
the
one
nagging
at
him
these
past
four
days
tried
to
stifle
it
the
words
were
forming
knew
he
braced
himself
hafta
start
thinkin
fought
it
seeking
to
kill
the
last
few
words
but
on
they
came
out
was
trembling
a
strange
feeling
upon
him
fully
expecting
some
catastrophe
to
strike
him
dead
on
the
spot
it
he
took
heart
the
final
word
came
forth
he
heard
it
fully
bout
takin
his
place
listened

felt
good
old
self
music

taking
him
its
rhythm

snaked
all
through

him
took
him
from

to
another
stopping

over
at
him

of
revulsion

loathed

thorn
in
my
side
of
the
whole
fucken

the

it
failed

to
the
spot

anyhow
pricks
like
run
it
anyway
one
way
or
another
them
rolled
over
and
tried
to
shut
out
the
noise
now
much
louder
snuggled
into
the
blanket
dreamed
was
sitting
on
top
of
a
log
which
was
spinning
round
and
around
in
the
water
river
wide
as
the
where
it
ran
by
his
place
log
was
spinning
he
was
not
what
should
be
spinning
just
because
the
goddamn
log
is
spinning
he
asked
this
out
loud
but
no
one
heard
it
over
the
other
noise
in
the
hut
on
the
bank
the
west
bank
a
man
stood
calling
to
him
make
out
what
he
was
saying
doubt
it
had
to
do
with
the
log
should
he
be
concerned
is
so
persuasive
that
is
almost
convinced
that
he
should
burn
his
books
too
while
the
two
men
are
riding
into
the
country
where
they
are
going
to
dinner
they
are
attacked
in
the
dark
of
the
forest
by
a
band
of
thieves
who
strip
them
of
everything
including
most
of
their
clothes
must
be
a
very
learned
man
says
to
one
of
the
bandits
learned
man
bandit
laughs
in
his
face
perseveres
goes
to
the
chief
himself
what
university
did
you
study
asks
refuses
to
believe
that
the
bandit
chief
never
attended
a
higher
institution
have
become
so
corrupt
he
says
surely
you
must
have
studied
many
arts
and
sciences
chief
annoyed
by
these
questions
knocks
down
and
shouts
at
him
that
he
not
only
never
went
to
any
school
but
never
even
learned
how
to
read
finally
the
two
bedraggled
men
reach
their
home
fears
are
once
again
aroused
it
is
such
a
distinguished
place
with
such
fine
works
of
art
and
such
a
big
library
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
but
that
the
owner
has
become
depraved
by
all
this
culture
surprise
however
their
host
gives
them
fresh
clothes
to
put
on
opens
his
purse
to
lend
them
money
and
sits
them
down
before
a
good
dinner
after
dinner
however
asks
for
still
another
favor
he
have
pen
and
paper
please
is
in
a
hurry
to
write
another
essay
against
culture
was
the
impromptu
that
gave
to
howls
of
laughter
at
and
that
was
soon
circulated
in
manuscript
throughout
the
literary
circles
of
to
be
printed
sometime
later
but
with
the
name
of
of
the
famous
misanthrope
substituted
for
that
of
cruel
at
the
same
time
how
understandable
could
the
rich
for
whom
life
was
made
so
simple
ever
understand
the
subterfuges
the
lies
the
frauds
the
errors
sins
and
even
crimes
to
which
the
poor
were
driven
in
their
efforts
to
overcome
the
great
advantages
the
rich
had
in
the
race
of
life
for
example
could
a
understand
the
strange
predicament
in
which
a
would
find
himself
when
soon
after
the
furor
of
his
first
he
acquired
still
another
title
to
fame
time
as
a
musician
a
composer
since
he
had
first
begun
to
study
music
and
to
teach
it
had
dreamed
of
piercing
through
to
fame
as
the
result
of
a
successful
opera
his
facility
in
this
genre
was
not
great
his
efforts
to
get
a
performance
for
his
invariably
failed
for
good
reasons
operatic
music
had
little
merit
then
one
day
while
on
a
visit
to
the
country
home
of
a
retired
jeweler
amused
the
company
with
a
few
little
melodies
he
had
written
to
which
he
attached
no
great
importance
was
really
amazed
to
discover
the
other
guests
so
excited
about
these
delicate
little
songs
a
few
such
songs
together
they
urged
him
them
onto
some
sort
of
little
plot
and
have
a
delightful
operetta
believe
them
he
said
is
the
sort
of
stuff
write
and
then
throw
away
forbid
the
ladies
enchanted
by
his
music
must
make
an
opera
out
of
this
material
they
leave
off
arguing
and
pleading
until
he
had
promised
the
irony
and
the
bitterness
of
it
after
all
his
years
of
effort
to
become
a
composer
he
should
now
now
when
he
was
still
stoutly
replying
to
the
critics
of
his
on
the
and
be
so
close
to
a
success
in
music
and
have
to
reject
it
at
least
appear
to
reject
it
what
else
could
he
do
on
the
one
hand
decry
the
arts
and
at
the
same
time
practice
them
could
you
yes
perhaps
in
literature
since
you
could
argue
that
you
keep
silent
about
your
feelings
against
literature
and
so
were
involved
in
spite
of
yourself
now
music
too
would
be
too
much
the
fault
of
course
was
fault
was
and
that
of
the
whole
culture
of
this
age
it
was
type
of
music
that
he
had
been
trying
to
write
and
that
he
write
little
songs
however
were
sweet
nothings
from
the
heart
tender
memories
of
his
childhood
little
melodies
that
anyone
could
hum
and
that
would
make
one
want
to
weep
no
appear
as
a
composer
now
glory
craved
for
so
long
was
now
forbidden
to
him
just
for
the
ladies
and
just
for
this
once
for
this
one
weekend
in
the
country
he
would
make
a
little
piece
out
of
his
melodies
ladies
were
delighted
and
was
applauded
everyone
went
to
work
to
learn
the
parts
which
he
wrote
then
after
the
little
operetta
had
been
given
its
feeble
amateur
rendering
everyone
insisted
that
it
was
too
good
to
be
lost
forever
and
that
the
of
must
now
have
the
manuscript
in
order
to
give
it
the
really
performance
it
merited
was
aware
that
he
must
seem
like
a
hypocrite
standing
there
and
arguing
that
he
could
not
possibly
permit
a
public
performance
ladies
especially
understand
what
troubled
him
contradiction
what
was
a
contradiction
in
life
woman
has
had
the
experience
of
saying
no
when
she
meant
yes
and
saying
yes
when
she
meant
no
had
to
admit
that
though
he
agree
to
a
public
performance
he
would
indeed
just
for
his
own
private
satisfaction
dearly
love
to
know
how
his
work
would
sound
when
done
by
professional
musicians
and
by
trained
voices
simply
like
to
know
if
it
is
as
good
as
you
kind
people
seem
to
think
he
said
the
historian
pointed
out
to
that
this
was
impossible
musicians
of
the
would
not
rehearse
a
work
merely
to
see
how
it
would
sound
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
agreed
he
recalled
that
had
once
had
a
private
performance
of
his
opera
behind
closed
doors
just
for
himself
alone
understood
what
was
bothering
that
the
writer
of
the
of
should
now
become
known
as
the
writer
of
an
amusing
little
operetta
would
certainly
be
paradoxical
thought
he
saw
a
way
out
me
do
the
submitting
to
the
he
suggested
name
will
never
appear
one
will
even
suspect
that
it
is
your
work
that
could
agree
now
what
crazy
twists
and
turns
of
his
emotions
at
one
and
the
same
time
that
his
work
might
be
turned
down
which
would
be
a
blow
to
his
pride
even
though
no
one
knew
he
was
the
author
and
that
the
work
would
be
accepted
and
then
that
his
violent
feelings
in
the
matter
would
certainly
betray
how
deeply
concerned
he
was
in
spite
of
himself
how
anxious
this
lover
of
obscurity
was
for
applause
thus
torn
between
his
desire
to
be
known
as
the
composer
of
a
successful
opera
and
the
necessity
of
remaining
true
to
his
proclaimed
desire
for
anonymity
suffered
through
several
painful
weeks
these
emotions
were
screwed
up
to
new
heights
when
after
acceptance
and
the
first
rehearsals
there
ensued
such
a
buzz
of
excitement
among
music
lovers
that
had
to
come
running
to
to
inform
him
that
the
news
had
reached
the
superintendent
of
the
amusements
and
that
he
was
now
demanding
that
the
work
be
offered
first
at
the
royal
summer
palace
of
the
honor
of
it
was
your
answer
asked
striving
to
appear
unimpressed
refused
said
else
could
do
was
incensed
of
course
said
would
first
have
to
get
the
permission
was
certain
he
would
refuse
infuriating
all
this
was
had
not
this
success
come
to
him
before
he
had
plunged
into
his
and
before
he
had
committed
himself
to
a
life
of
austerity
and
denial
when
everything
was
opening
up
to
him
even
the
court
of
he
had
to
play
a
role
of
and
forth
had
to
go
between
and
and
between
the
and
again
as
his
little
operetta
though
still
unperformed
took
on
ever
more
importance
of
course
the
news
of
who
the
composer
was
did
finally
begin
to
get
around
among
his
closest
friends
they
naturally
kept
his
secret
well
and
the
public
at
large
knew
only
of
a
great
excitement
in
musical
and
court
circles
titillating
it
was
to
go
among
people
who
did
not
know
him
as
the
composer
but
who
talked
in
the
most
glowing
terms
of
the
promise
of
the
piece
after
having
heard
the
first
rehearsals
furor
was
such
that
people
who
could
not
possibly
have
squirmed
their
way
into
the
rehearsals
were
pretending
that
they
were
intimate
with
the
whole
affair
and
that
it
would
be
sensational
listening
to
such
a
conversation
one
morning
while
taking
a
cup
of
chocolate
in
a
cafe
found
himself
bathed
in
perspiration
trembling
lest
his
authorship
become
known
and
at
the
same
time
dreaming
of
the
startling
effect
he
would
make
if
he
should
proclaim
himself
suddenly
as
the
composer
felt
himself
now
as
he
himself
says
in
his
at
a
crucial
point
of
his
life
that
was
why
on
the
day
of
the
performance
when
a
carriage
from
the
royal
stables
called
to
take
him
to
the
palace
he
did
not
bother
to
shave
the
contrary
he
was
pleased
that
his
face
showed
a
neglect
of
several
days
him
in
that
condition
and
about
to
enter
the
hall
where
the
the
the
whole
royal
family
and
all
the
members
of
the
highest
aristocracy
would
be
present
and
the
and
others
tried
to
stop
him
go
in
that
way
cried
not
asked
is
going
to
stop
me
dressed
for
the
occasion
pointed
out
to
him
dressed
as
always
am
said
better
nor
worse
home
yes
they
argued
here
you
are
in
the
palace
the
they
are
here
then
surely
have
the
right
to
be
here
said
even
more
right
am
the
composer
in
such
a
slovenly
condition
is
slovenly
about
me
asked
it
because
of
my
slovenliness
that
hair
grows
on
my
face
it
would
grow
there
whether
washed
myself
or
not
hundred
years
ago
would
have
worn
a
beard
with
pride
those
without
beards
would
have
stood
out
as
not
dressed
for
the
occasion
times
have
changed
and
must
pretend
that
hair
grow
on
my
face
the
fashion
fashion
is
the
real
king
here
since
even
he
obeys
if
you
mind
should
like
to
hear
my
own
piece
performed
of
course
behind
his
boldness
he
feel
bold
at
all
trembled
lest
his
piece
should
fail
this
in
addition
to
his
usual
fear
of
being
among
people
of
high
society
his
fear
of
making
some
inane
or
inappropriate
remark
even
deeper
than
that
his
fear
lest
in
this
closed
hall
he
should
suddenly
itch
to
relieve
himself
he
walk
out
in
the
midst
of
his
piece
before
the
court
the
was
the
first
time
any
of
us
had
laughed
since
the
morning
began
rider
from
was
as
good
as
his
word
came
spurring
and
whooping
down
the
road
his
horse
kicking
up
clouds
of
dust
shouting
they
are
heard
him
before
he
ever
showed
and
we
heard
him
yelling
after
he
was
out
of
sight
misjudged
the
strength
of
his
lungs
not
at
all
think
you
could
have
heard
him
a
mile
away
and
he
was
bursting
at
every
seam
with
importance
have
observed
that
being
up
on
a
horse
changes
the
whole
character
of
a
man
and
when
a
very
small
man
is
up
on
a
saddle
like
as
not
prefer
to
eat
his
meals
there
understandable
and
appreciate
the
sentiment
for
this
rider
never
saw
him
before
or
afterwards
and
never
saw
him
dismounted
so
whether
he
stood
tall
or
short
in
his
shoes
say
but
do
know
that
he
gave
the
day
tone
and
distinction
last
thing
in
the
world
that
resembled
a
war
was
our
line
of
farmers
and
storekeepers
and
mechanics
perched
on
top
of
a
stone
wall
and
this
dashing
rider
made
us
feel
a
good
deal
sharper
and
more
alert
to
the
situation
came
down
off
the
wall
as
if
he
had
toppled
all
of
us
and
we
crouched
behind
it
have
heard
people
talk
with
contempt
about
the
regulars
but
that
only
proves
that
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
things
of
which
they
are
deplorably
ignorant
we
felt
about
the
redcoats
we
respected
them
in
terms
of
their
trade
which
was
killing
and
know
that
myself
was
nauseated
with
apprehension
and
fear
and
that
my
hands
were
soaking
wet
where
they
held
my
gun
wanted
to
wipe
my
flint
but
dare
to
the
state
my
hands
were
in
just
as
dare
to
do
anything
about
the
priming
gun
would
fire
or
not
just
as
chance
willed
put
a
lot
more
trust
in
my
two
legs
than
in
the
gun
because
the
most
important
thing
had
learned
about
war
was
that
you
could
run
away
and
survive
to
talk
about
it
gunfire
which
was
so
near
that
it
seemed
just
a
piece
up
the
road
now
stopped
for
long
enough
to
count
to
twenty
and
in
that
brief
interval
a
redcoat
officer
came
tearing
down
the
road
whipping
his
horse
fit
to
kill
know
whether
he
was
after
our
rider
who
had
gone
by
a
minute
before
or
whether
he
was
simply
scouting
conditions
but
when
he
passed
us
by
a
musket
roared
and
he
reared
his
horse
swung
it
around
and
began
to
whip
it
back
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
was
a
fine
and
showy
rider
but
his
skill
was
wasted
on
us
above
me
and
somewhere
behind
me
a
rifle
cracked
redcoat
officer
collapsed
like
a
punctured
bolster
and
the
horse
reared
and
threw
him
from
the
saddle
except
that
one
booted
foot
caught
in
the
stirrup
crazed
by
the
weight
dragging
the
dust
and
the
heat
the
horse
leaped
our
wall
dashing
out
the
brains
against
it
and
leaving
him
lying
there
among
us
while
the
horse
crashed
away
through
the
brush
was
my
initiation
to
war
and
the
insane
symphony
war
plays
for
what
had
happened
on
the
common
was
only
terror
and
flight
but
this
grinning
broken
head
not
ten
feet
away
from
me
was
the
sharp
definition
of
what
my
reality
had
become
now
the
redcoats
were
coming
and
the
gunfire
was
a
part
of
the
dust
cloud
on
the
road
to
the
west
of
us
must
state
that
the
faster
things
happened
the
slower
they
happened
the
passage
and
rhythm
of
time
changed
and
when
remember
back
to
what
happened
then
each
event
is
a
separate
and
frozen
incident
my
recollection
there
was
a
long
interval
between
the
death
of
the
officer
and
the
appearance
of
the
first
of
the
retreating
redcoats
and
in
that
interval
the
dust
cloud
over
the
road
seems
to
hover
indefinitely
it
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
matter
of
seconds
and
then
the
front
of
the
army
came
into
view
was
only
hours
since
had
last
seen
them
but
they
had
changed
and
had
changed
the
very
front
rank
two
men
were
wounded
and
staggered
along
trailing
blood
behind
them
drummers
here
no
pipers
and
the
red
coats
were
covered
with
a
fine
film
of
dust
marched
with
bayonets
fixed
and
as
fixed
on
their
faces
was
anger
fear
and
torment
after
rank
of
them
came
down
the
road
and
the
faces
were
all
the
same
and
they
walked
in
a
sea
of
dust
hold
your
fire
your
fire
voice
called
and
what
made
it
even
more
terrible
and
unreal
was
that
the
redcoat
ranks
never
paused
for
an
instant
only
some
of
them
glancing
toward
the
stone
wall
from
behind
which
the
voice
came
front
of
their
column
had
already
passed
us
when
another
officer
came
riding
down
the
side
of
the
road
not
five
paces
from
where
we
were
carried
a
musket
but
he
had
loaded
it
with
bird
shot
and
as
the
officer
came
opposite
him
he
rose
up
behind
the
wall
and
fired
moment
there
was
a
man
in
the
saddle
the
next
a
headless
horror
on
a
horse
that
bolted
through
the
redcoat
ranks
and
during
the
next
second
or
two
we
all
of
us
fired
into
the
suddenly
disorganized
column
of
soldiers
moment
the
road
was
filled
with
disciplined
troops
marching
four
by
four
with
a
purpose
as
implacable
as
death
the
next
a
cloud
of
gun
smoke
covered
a
screaming
fury
of
sound
out
of
which
the
redcoat
soldiers
emerged
with
their
bayonets
and
their
cursing
fury
the
course
of
this
they
had
fired
on
us
but
have
no
memory
of
that
had
squeezed
the
trigger
of
my
own
gun
and
to
my
amazement
it
had
fired
and
kicked
back
into
my
shoulder
with
the
force
of
an
angry
mule
and
then
was
adding
my
own
voice
to
the
crescendo
of
sound
hurling
more
vile
language
than
ever
thought
knew
sobbing
and
shouting
and
aware
that
if
had
passed
water
before
it
was
not
enough
for
my
pants
were
soaking
wet
would
have
stood
there
and
died
there
if
left
to
myself
but
grabbed
my
arm
in
his
viselike
grip
and
fairly
plucked
me
out
of
there
and
then
came
to
some
sanity
and
plunged
away
with
such
extraordinary
speed
that
outdistanced
by
far
else
was
running
we
realized
that
the
redcoats
had
stopped
their
charge
at
the
wall
only
hope
of
survival
was
to
hold
to
the
road
and
keep
marching
tumbled
to
a
stop
in
cow
hole
a
bit
of
pasture
with
a
muddy
pool
of
water
in
its
middle
dozen
cows
mooed
sadly
and
regarded
us
as
if
we
were
insane
as
perhaps
we
were
at
that
moment
with
the
crazy
excitement
of
our
first
encounter
the
yelling
and
shooting
still
continuing
up
at
the
road
and
the
thirst
of
some
of
the
men
which
was
so
great
that
they
waded
into
the
muddy
water
and
scooped
up
handfuls
of
it
one
of
the
men
from
had
taken
a
musket
ball
in
his
belly
and
though
he
had
found
the
strength
to
run
with
us
now
he
collapsed
and
lay
on
the
ground
dying
the
holding
his
head
and
wiping
his
hot
brow
may
appear
that
we
were
cruel
and
callous
but
no
one
had
time
to
spend
sympathizing
with
poor
except
the
know
that
myself
felt
that
it
was
a
mortal
shame
for
a
man
to
be
torn
open
by
a
musket
ball
as
had
been
yet
also
felt
relieved
and
lucky
that
it
had
been
him
and
not
myself
was
drunk
with
excitement
and
the
smell
of
gunpowder
that
came
floating
down
from
the
road
and
the
fact
that
was
not
afraid
now
but
only
waiting
to
know
what
to
do
next
reloaded
my
gun
as
the
other
men
were
doing
were
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
and
we
could
trace
its
shape
from
the
ribbon
of
powder
smoke
and
dust
that
hung
over
it
you
looked
you
saw
running
across
the
meadows
some
away
from
the
road
some
toward
it
some
parallel
to
it
and
about
a
mile
to
the
west
a
cluster
of
at
least
fifty
were
making
their
way
in
our
direction
and
some
others
felt
that
we
should
march
toward
and
take
up
new
positions
ahead
of
the
column
but
another
group
maintained
that
we
should
stick
to
this
spot
and
this
section
of
road
offer
any
advice
but
certainly
did
not
want
to
go
back
to
where
the
officer
lay
with
his
brains
dashed
out
said
that
while
we
were
standing
here
and
arguing
about
it
the
would
be
gone
but
said
he
had
watched
them
marching
west
early
in
the
morning
and
moving
at
a
much
brisker
pace
it
had
still
taken
half
an
hour
for
their
column
to
pass
what
with
the
narrowness
of
the
road
and
their
baggage
and
ammunition
carts
this
was
being
discussed
we
saw
the
militia
to
the
west
of
us
fanning
out
and
breaking
into
little
clusters
of
two
and
three
men
as
they
approached
the
road
was
the
opinion
of
some
of
us
that
these
must
be
part
of
the
who
had
been
in
the
of
the
which
entitled
them
to
a
sort
of
veteran
status
and
we
felt
that
if
they
employed
this
tactic
it
was
likely
enough
the
best
one
said
makes
sense
we
cluster
together
the
redcoats
can
make
an
advantage
out
of
it
but
not
a
blessed
thing
they
can
do
with
two
or
three
of
us
except
chase
us
and
we
can
outrun
them
settled
it
and
we
broke
into
parties
of
two
and
three
decided
to
remain
with
the
and
poor
until
life
passed
away
and
he
was
hurt
so
badly
he
did
not
seem
for
long
in
this
world
went
off
with
who
maintained
that
if
he
see
to
me
he
know
who
would
heavens
he
said
thought
one
thing
have
no
trouble
learning
is
when
to
get
out
of
a
place
learned
that
now
said
ran
east
for
about
half
a
mile
before
we
turned
back
to
the
road
panting
from
the
effort
and
soaked
with
sweat
was
a
clump
of
trees
that
appeared
to
provide
cover
right
up
to
the
road
and
the
shouting
and
gunfire
never
slackened
the
trees
there
was
a
dead
redcoat
a
young
boy
with
a
pasty
white
skin
and
a
face
full
of
pimples
who
had
taken
a
rifle
ball
directly
between
the
eyes
men
were
around
him
had
stripped
him
of
his
musket
and
equipment
and
now
they
were
pulling
his
boots
and
jacket
off
grabbed
one
of
them
by
the
shoulder
and
flung
him
away
name
what
are
you
to
rob
the
dead
with
the
fight
going
on
roared
tried
to
outface
him
but
was
as
wide
as
two
average
men
and
it
would
have
taken
braver
men
than
these
were
to
outface
him
summer
the
gambling
houses
were
closed
despite
the
threats
of
a
manufacturer
was
no
longer
permitted
in
the
streets
and
other
places
of
prostitution
were
emptied
slit
breeches

to
go

no

defiance
a
chinless
reprobate
marched
down
the
aisle
in
one
morning
followed
by
one
of
the
women
from
the
whose
dress
and
walk
plainly
showed
the
lack
of
any
shame
themselves
down
on
the
front
bench
they
turned
to
smirk
at
those
around
them
first
impulse
was
to
denounce
their
blasphemy
the
thought
occurred
that
would
want
this
opportunity
used
to
tell
them

if
there
had

brazen
attempt

dishonor

man
next
morning
as
the
clock
struck
nine
he
appeared
at
the
meeting
in
the
and
insisted
that
the
couple
would
have
to
be
punished
if
the
was
to
be
respected
have
told
you
before
and
tell
you
again

rudely

the
preaching

in
anger

the
answer

ungodly
will
always
make
when
the
points
its
fingers
at
their
sins

to
you
that
the

ever
decry

reply
was
like
a
declaration
of
war

down
in
his
stall
lips
compressed

glinting
a
short
man
with
a
rotunda
of
stomach

was
on
him
as
he
began
to
speak

true

we
have
a
good
city

we
respect

a
tall
man
with
sunken
cheeks
and

got
to
his
feet

know
that
and
the
woman
are
brazenly
living
together
would
be
well
to
show
the
populace
how
we
deal
with
adulterers
the
son
of
the
famous
patriot
disagreed
not
listen
to
that

throttling
the
liberty
my
father

week
later
the

carried
out
and
the

marched
naked
through
the
streets
past
a
mocking
populace

raced
painfully
into
the
past
as
he
read
the
letter

had
just
received
from
his
sister

died
two
weeks
before
in
early
without
being
reconciled
to
the
canons

body
had
tried
to
force
him
on
his
deathbed
to
let
them
give
him
the
last
rites
of

but
he
had
died
still
proclaiming

taken
place
at
night
in
the
ground
at
the
public
crossroads
under
the
gibbet

that
his
enemies
could
not
find
his
body
and
have
it
dug
up
and
burned
of
had
been
a
good
friend
but
not
even
he
thought
deserved
burial
in
hallowed
ground
closed
his
eyes
and
saw
once
again
the
little
niche
in
his
bedroom
where
she
had
knelt
to
tell
the
good
of
her
needs
was
still
there
but
no
one
knelt
before
her
now
even
she
too
prayed
only
to
an
instant
longed
for
the
sound
of
the
bells
of
the
touch
of
his
hand
the
lilt
of
voice
in
the
square
raftered
rooms
his
bass
tones
rumbling
to
the
canons
and
the
sight
of
the
beloved
bishop
he
had
to
follow
the
light
expected
a
man
to
believe
the
why
had
given
them
to
him
trees
stood
like
specters
in
the
night
buried
the
streets
and
covered
the
slanting
rooftops
as
trudged
toward
carriage
crunched
by
its
dim
lights
filtering
through
the
gloom
sharp
wind
slapped
at
him
and
his
feet
felt
like
ice
as
the
snow
penetrated
the
holes
of
his
shoes
his
only
ones
now
patched
with
folded
parchment
city
had
recently
given
him
a
small
salary
but
it
was
not
enough
to
supply
even
necessities
he
neared
the
square
a
round
figure
muffled
in
a
long
black
cape
whisked
by
recognized
and
called
out
a
greeting
grateful
he
was
to
such
men
were
several
on
the
who
tried
to
live
like
their
efforts
the
problems
seemed
to
grow
graver
all
the
time
his
steps
entered
the
vast
church
and
climbed
the
tower
steps
to
the
bells
the
big
one
in
the
silent
moonlight
lay
a
dead
pigeon
and
on
the
smaller
bell
the
two
gray
and
white
birds
slept
huddled
together
in
the
cold
winter
air
leaned
upon
the
stone
balustrade
brushed
back
his
black
hair
shoving
it
under
his
cap
to
keep
it
from
blowing
in
his
eyes
the
world
rolled
away
to
insurmountable
white
peaks
above
him
the
deep
blue
sky
glittered
with
stars
stood
very
still
his
arms
at
his
sides
staring
up
at
the
heavens
then
down
at
the
blinking
lights
below
long
my
long
have
never
asked
for
an
easy
task
but
am
weary
of
the
strife
was
difficult
these
days
plagued
him
headaches
were
frequent
tore
through
him
like
a
physical
pain
whenever
he
thought
of
and
even
the
compromising
occasional
traveler
from
brought
news
of
who
was
now
distributing
his
among
the
peasants
came
regularly
from
and
had
and
to
confide
in
and
consult
continued
to
find
a
bitter
joy
in
smashing
images
and
tearing
down
symbols
sacred
to
the
found
it
difficult
but
he
held
him
in
check
was
busy
most
of
the
time
courting
this
girl
and
that
easy
good
looks
made
him
a
favorite
with
the
ladies
instead
of
becoming
the
of
as
had
dreamed
had
in
the
two
years
since
he
had
been
there
continued
to
be
a
godless
place
where
all
manner
of
vice
flourished
poured
in
signing
the
and
rules
in
order
to
remain
and
then
disregarding
them
rolled
prostitutes
plied
their
trade
thieves
stole
murderers
stabbed
and
the
ungodly
blasphemed
who
were
truly
longed
for
the
simple
penance
of
days
gone
by
recalled
the
heroism
of
the
past
and
demanded
we
going
to
allow
the
to
curtail
our
liberty
oh
why
he
stick
to
preaching
the
instead
of
meddling
in
civic
affairs
politics
economics
and
social
issues
that
are
no
concern
of
the
reply
was
always
the
same
that
affects
souls
is
the
concern
of
the
will
have
righteousness
burned
behind
his
eyes
as
he
prayed
and
meditated
tonight
the
confusion
cleared
he
would
not
be
coming
here
much
longer
threat
would
become
a
reality
for
he
continued
to
proclaim
loudly
that
the
city
must
rid
itself
of
that
slow
tapping
of
a
cane
on
the
stone
steps
coming
up
to
the
tower
interrupted
his
reverie
at
first
the
tapping
grew
until
it
sounded
loud
against
the
wind
thought
is
he
doing
here
at
this
hour
started
down
the
steps
to
meet
the
preacher
who
had
been
one
of
the
early
in
that
you
came
to
warn
you
of
a
plot
stood
above
him
his
face
ashen
now
like
a
man
grown
old
he
took
hand
and
led
him
below
to
the
tower
study
guiding
him
to
a
chair
beside
the
little
hearth
where
a
fire
still
burned
asked
tiredly
just
paid
me
a
visit
went
to
your
rooms
and
told
me
you
were
here
and
are
to
challenge
you
and
to
a
debate
before
the
is
to
be
a
trap
know
the
law
if
you
lose
the
debate
after
accepting
a
challenge
you
will
be
banished
will
be
the
subject
are
to
be
accused
of
to
confuse
the
religious
who
remain
loyal
and
fear
fused
in
since
the
fourth
century
a
controversy
had
raged
over
the
person
of
who
refused
to
believe
that
was
the
eternal
of
were
termed
had
come
to
saying
that
he
had
been
a
bishop
of
the
of
and
had
been
persecuted
in
for
his
faith
asked
to
be
appointed
a
preacher
had
unmasked
him
revealing
he
had
never
been
a
bishop
but
was
an
afraid
to
state
his
faith
because
he
knew
had
written
a
book
against
their
belief
that
the
soul
slept
after
death
had
refused
to
agree
to
his
appointment
as
a
preacher
and
now
sought
revenge
sighed
agrees
we
should
insist
on
a
public
debate
he
said
at
length
is
more
to
the
conspiracy
demands
that
the
be
administered
here
as
it
used
to
be
with
unleavened
bread
decrees
that
we
must
do
as
we
are
ordered
by
the
preach
only
the
word
of
and
stop
meddling
in
politics
was
always
the
spirit
with
matters
such
as
leavened
or
unleavened
bread
are
inconsequential
must
remain
a
sovereign
state
will
not
yield
to
the
demands
of
firelight
played
over
flowing
white
locks
and
rugged
features
indicated
that
if
would
after
you
and
are
banished
following
the
debate
will
be
given
a
place
of
influence
was
your
reply
to
that
would
rather
be
banished
with
two
such
than
be
made
the
following
morning
as
entered
the
on
his
way
to
visit
a
sick
refugee
he
had
a
premonition
of
danger
suddenly
a
group
of
men
and
dogs
circled
him
wanted
to
run
but
he
knew
that
if
he
did
he
would
be
lost
stood
very
still
his
heart
thumping
wildly
the
outskirts
of
the
rabble
the
brothers
and
shook
their
fists
you
going
to
comply
with
the
demands
of
chinless
called
rowdy
with
a
big
blob
of
a
nose
roared
lifted
his
hand
for
silence
this
the
ministers
will
not
yield
to
the
demands
of
voice
shook
a
little
heaved
a
stone
an
instant
was
stunned
he
felt
the
side
of
his
head
his
fingers
came
away
covered
with
blood
he
could
duck
another
stone
struck
him
another
him
be
now
the
manufacturer
said
his
little
pig
eyes
glaring
have
taught
him
a
lesson
crowd
moved
back
and
started
dizzily
down
the
hill
pummeled
him
as
he
staggered
forward
he
slipped
and
went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
melting
snow
once
a
bevy
of
dogs
was
snapping
and
snarling
around
him
more
horrible
than
the
rest
lunged
growling
deep
in
his
throat
his
hair
bristling
great
difficulty
clambered
to
his
feet
and
started
to
run
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
in
the
shelter
of
the
tent
a
rejected
hospital
tent
on
which
the
rain
now
dripped
no
longer
drumming
watched
his
own
hands
touch
the
objects
on
the
improvised
counter
of
boards
laid
across
two
beer
barrels
was
of
course
no
real
need
to
rearrange
everything
quarter
inch
this
way
or
that
for
the
hardbake
or
the
toffee
or
the
barley
sugar
or
the
sardines
or
the
bitters
or
the
condensed
milk
or
the
stationery
or
the
needles
what
could
it
mean
watched
his
own
hands
make
the
caressing
anxious
movement
that
when
rain
falls
and
nobody
comes
and
ruin
draws
close
like
a
cat
rubbing
against
the
ankles
has
been
the
ritual
of
stall
vendors
forever
recognized
the
gesture
knew
its
meaning
had
seen
a
dry
old
yellowing
hand
reach
out
with
that
painful
solicitude
to
touch
to
rearrange
to
shift
aimlessly
some
object
worth
a
pfennig
in
he
had
seen
that
gesture
and
at
that
sight
his
heart
had
always
died
within
him
such
occasions
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
look
at
the
face
above
the
hand
whatever
face
it
might
be
the
face
was
his
own
wondered
what
expression
as
he
made
that
gesture
was
on
his
face
wondered
if
it
wore
the
old
anxiety
or
the
old
taut
stoicism
there
was
no
need
he
remembered
for
his
hand
to
reach
out
for
his
face
to
show
concern
or
stoicism
was
nothing
to
him
if
rain
fell
and
nobody
came
why
was
he
assuming
the
role
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
was
he
expiating
was
he
now
taking
the
role
the
gesture
and
the
suffering
because
it
was
the
only
way
to
affirm
his
history
and
identity
in
the
torpid
befogged
loneliness
of
this
land
was
looked
out
of
the
tent
at
the
company
street
rain
dripped
on
the
freezing
loblolly
of
the
street
that
misty
gray
of
the
rain
he
saw
the
stretching
hutment
low
diminutive
log
cabins
chinked
with
mud
with
doorways
a
man
would
have
to
crouch
to
get
through
with
roofs
of
tenting
laid
over
boughs
or
boards
from
hardtack
boxes
or
fence
rails
with
cranky
chimneys
of
sticks
and
dried
mud
chimney
of
the
hut
across
from
him
was
surmounted
by
a
beef
barrel
with
ends
knocked
out
this
heavy
air
however
that
device
did
not
seem
to
help
smoke
from
that
chimney
rose
as
sluggishly
as
smoke
from
any
other
and
hung
as
sadly
in
the
drizzle
creeping
back
down
along
the
sopping
canvas
of
the
roof
the
door
was
a
board
with
large
inept
lettering
home
sweet
home
was
the
hut
of
the
hero
men
were
huddled
in
those
lairs
knew
the
names
of
some
knew
the
faces
of
all
hairy
or
shaven
old
or
young
fat
or
thin
suffering
or
hardened
sad
or
gay
good
or
bad
they
stood
about
his
tent
chaffing
each
other
exchanging
their
obscenities
cursing
command
or
weather
he
had
studied
their
faces
had
had
the
need
to
understand
what
life
lurked
behind
the
mask
of
flesh
behind
the
oath
the
banter
the
sadness
covertly
looking
at
the
only
man
in
the
world
whom
he
hated
he
had
seen
the
heavy
slack
bestubbled
jaw
open
and
close
to
emit
the
cruel
obscene
banter
and
had
seen
the
eyes
go
watery
with
whisky
and
merriment
and
suddenly
he
was
not
seeing
the
face
of
that
vile
creature
was
seeing
somehow
the
face
of
a
young
boy
the
boy
must
once
have
been
a
boy
with
sorrel
hair
and
blue
eyes
dancing
with
gaiety
and
the
boy
mouth
grinning
trustfully
among
the
freckles
that
moment
of
vision
heard
the
voice
within
himself
saying
must
not
hate
him
must
not
hate
him
or
shall
die
heart
suddenly
opened
to
joy
thought
that
if
once
only
once
he
could
talk
with
something
about
his
own
life
and
all
life
would
be
clear
and
simple
would
turn
to
him
and
say
you
know
when
was
a
boy
it
was
a
funny
thing
happened
tell
you
now
only
could
do
that
whatever
the
thing
he
remembered
and
told
would
be
a
sign
for
the
untellable
and
he
would
understand
in
the
gray
light
of
afternoon
stared
across
at
the
hut
opposite
his
tent
and
thought
of
lying
in
there
in
the
gloom
snoring
on
his
bunk
with
the
fumes
of
whisky
choking
the
air
saw
the
sign
above
the
door
of
the
hut
home
sweet
home
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
poncho
coming
up
the
company
street
with
an
armful
of
wood
was
the
campmate
of
carried
the
wood
carried
the
water
did
the
cooking
cleaning
and
mending
and
occasionally
got
a
kick
in
the
butt
for
his
pains
watched
the
moisture
flow
from
the
poncho
gave
the
rubberized
fabric
a
dull
gleam
like
metal
humbly
lowered
his
head
pushed
aside
the
door
of
the
hut
and
was
gone
from
sight
stared
at
the
door
and
remembered
that
had
been
awarded
the
of
for
gallantry
at
street
was
again
empty
drizzle
was
slacking
off
now
but
the
light
was
grayer
enormous
interest
watched
his
hands
as
they
touched
and
shifted
the
objects
on
the
board
directly
before
him
the
emptiness
of
the
street
and
his
spirit
moved
a
form
form
was
swathed
in
an
army
blanket
much
patched
fastened
at
the
neck
with
a
cord
under
the
shapeless
huddle
of
blanket
the
feet
moved
in
the
mud
feet
wore
army
shoes
in
obvious
disrepair
head
was
wrapped
in
a
turban
and
on
top
of
the
turban
rode
a
great
hamper
across
which
a
piece
of
poncho
had
been
flung
gray
face
stared
straight
ahead
in
the
drizzle
ran
down
the
cheeks
gathered
at
the
tip
of
the
nose
and
at
the
chin
figure
was
close
enough
now
for
him
to
see
the
nose
twitching
to
dislodge
the
drop
clinging
there
figure
stopped
and
one
hand
was
perilously
freed
from
the
hamper
to
scratch
the
nose
the
figure
moved
on
was
one
of
the
women
who
had
built
their
own
huts
down
near
the
river
did
washing
recognized
this
one
recognized
her
because
she
was
the
one
who
in
a
winter
twilight
on
the
edge
of
camp
had
once
stopped
him
and
reached
down
her
hand
to
touch
his
fly
mutton
bhoy
had
queried
in
her
soft
guttural
mutton
name
was
called
her
the
and
laughed
down
the
street
after
her
saw
that
she
had
again
stopped
and
again
removed
one
hand
from
the
basket
could
not
make
out
but
he
knew
that
again
she
was
scratching
her
nose
the
was
scratching
her
nose
words
ran
crazily
in
his
head
the
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
the
words
fell
into
a
pattern
the
is
scratching
her
nose
her
nose
in
the
rain
the
is
scratching
her
nose
in
the
rain
pattern
would
not
stop
came
again
and
again
felt
trapped
in
that
pattern
in
the
repetition
he
thought
he
might
weep
the
matter
with
me
demanded
out
loud
looked
wildly
around
at
the
now
empty
street
at
the
mud
at
the
rain
the
matter
with
me
demanded
he
had
stored
his
stock
in
the
great
oak
chest
locked
the
two
big
hasps
and
secured
the
additional
chain
tied
the
fly
of
the
tent
and
picked
up
the
cash
box
he
moved
up
the
darkening
street
would
consign
the
cash
box
into
the
hands
of
then
stand
by
while
his
employer
checked
the
contents
and
the
list
of
items
sold
he
what
did
not
know
mind
closed
on
that
prospect
as
though
fog
had
descended
to
blot
out
a
valley
off
in
the
dusk
he
heard
voices
singing
muffled
but
strong
one
of
the
huts
a
group
of
men
were
huddled
together
singing
stopped
strained
to
hear
heard
the
words
of
cleft
for
me
me
hide
myself
in
the
water
and
the
blood
riven
side
flow
thought
am
a
from
was
standing
there
he
thought
in
in
the
thickening
dusk
in
a
costly
greatcoat
that
had
belonged
to
another
other
a
young
man
too
had
left
that
greatcoat
behind
in
a
rich
house
and
marched
away
had
crossed
the
river
which
now
beyond
the
woods
yonder
was
sliding
darkly
under
the
mist
had
plunged
into
the
dark
woods
beyond
had
died
there
had
that
man
that
other
young
felt
as
he
stood
in
the
twilight
and
heard
other
men
far
away
singing
together
thought
of
the
hutments
regiment
after
regiment
row
after
row
the
thousands
of
huts
stretching
away
into
the
night
thought
of
the
men
the
nameless
thousands
huddling
in
them
thought
of
snoring
on
his
bunk
while
crouched
by
the
hearth
skirmishing
an
undershirt
for
lice
and
a
wet
log
sizzled
thought
of
who
once
had
risen
at
the
edge
of
a
cornfield
a
maniacal
scream
on
his
lips
and
swung
a
clubbed
musket
like
a
flail
to
beat
down
the
swirl
of
bayonets
about
him
thought
of
rising
up
fearless
in
glory
felt
the
sweetness
of
pity
flood
through
him
veining
his
very
flesh

lying
in

pity
for
them

in
his
rich
house
saying

tired
of
taking
the
blame
is
going
to
let
take
the
blame
for
a
while
thought
of
the
old
man
laughing
under
the
glitter
of
the
great
chandelier
thought
in
my
heart

make
the
world
hang
together

crouch
necessary
to

shook
his
head
said
was
a
child
too
much
a
part
of
her
environment
too
eager
to
grow
and
learn
and
experience
they
were
at
for
the
summer
again
said
a
good
place
even
though
they
were
being
robbed
soft
evening
that
marvelous
time
when
the
departing
warmth
lingers
and
a
smell
of
spume
and
wrack
haunts
everything
had
picked
herself
off
the
floor
and
begun
to
walk
was
on
the
couch
reading
was
sitting
in
an
easy
chair
about
eight
feet
away
infant
in
white
bathrobe
her
face
intense
and
purposeful
had
essayed
a
few
wobbly
steps
toward
her
father
wanna
walk

he
said
gently
he
shoved
her
behind
toward
walked
making
it
halfway
across
the
cottage
floor
lost
not
a
second
picking
herself
up
and
continuing
her
pilgrimage
to
took
her
gently
and
shoved
her
off
again
toward
did
not
laugh
this
was
work
concentration
achievement
a
few
minutes
she
was
making
the
hike
unaided
soon
she
was
parading
around
the
house
flaunting
her
new
skill
logic
a
wisp
of
optimism
as
fragile
as
the
scent
of
tropical
blossoms
that
came
through
the
window
a
euphoria
perhaps
engendered
by
the
pill
had
given
her
consoled
her
for
a
moment
had
to
be
safe
had
to
come
back
to
them
if
only
to
reap
that
share
of
experiences
that
were
her
due
if
only
to
give
her
parents
another
chance
to
do
better
by
her
the
swathings
of
terror
she
jabbed
sharp
point
would
be
reborn
a
new
child
with
new
parents
living
under
new
circumstances
comfort
was
yet
she
found
herself
returning
to
the
assurance
whenever
her
imagination
forced
images
on
her
too
awful
to
contemplate
without
the
prop
of
illusion
at
her
drugged
body
his
chest
rising
and
falling
in
mindless
rhythms
she
saw
the
grandeur
of
his
fictional
world
that
lush
garden
from
which
he
plucked
flowers
and
herbs
envied
him
admired
him
the
darkness
she
saw
him
stirring
seemed
to
be

been
up
since
on
the

unable

during
his
relief
night
before
they
had
telephoned
the
maid
and
she
had
arrived
early
bursting
her
vigorous
presence
into
the
silent
house
with
an
assurance
that
amused
and
confounded

thanking
her
for

black
and
very
energetic
trim
in

yellow
pique
uniform
speech
was
barren
of
southernisms
she
was
one
of
neutralized
minorities
adopting
the
rolling
and
constricted
vowels
of
seeing
her
dark
intelligent
face
one
would
have
gauged
the
voice
as
that
of
a
matron
ten
years
out
of
she
had
served
the
detectives
coffee
and
toast
they
politely
declined
eggs
uncomfortable
about
their
tenancy
she
settled
down
with
a
morning
newspaper
and
began
reading
the
stock
market
quotations
she
was
thus
engaged
questioned
her
about
her
whereabouts
the
previous
day
any
recollections
she
had
of
people
hanging
around
of
overcurious
delivery
boys
or
repairmen
of
strange
cars
cruising
the
neighborhood
answered
him

little
to
say
to
each

horror
the
absolute
failure
overcast
with
the
intrusions
of
the

had
left
them
all
with
a
wan
sense
of
uselessness
of
their
coffee
discussing
the
weather
the
shopping
commitments
at
the

all
of
which

caravan
of
the
previous
night
there
were
only
four
cars
parked
across
the
street
men
he
did
not
recognize
were
sipping
coffee
and
munching
sweet
rolls
did
not

a
mountainous
dark
man
his
head
thick
with
resiny
black
hair

eyes
like
two
of
the
black
olives
he
imported
in
boatloads

himself
master
of
the
house
his
nourished
face
unrevealing
consented
to
postpone
his
departure
a
few
minutes
to
talk
to
the
detective
as
soon
as
had
disclosed
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
errand
his
family
gathered
in
a
huddle
forming
a
mass
of
dark
flesh
on

around
a
brocaded
sofa
which
stood
at
one
side
of
a
baroque
fireplace
by
marble
urns
and
alabaster
lamps
they
seemed
to
be
posing
for
a
tribal
portrait
was
amazing
how
they
had
herded
together
for
protection
an
enormous
matriarch
in
a
quilted
silk
wrapper
rising
from
the
breakfast
table
a
gross
boy
in
his

in
from

sandwich
in

in

twenties

and
sullen
descending
the
marble
staircase
then
all
four
gathering
on
the
sofa
to
face
the
inquisitor
answered
him
in
monosyllables
nods
occasionally
muttering
in
to
one
another
awaiting
the
word
from
who
restlessly
cracked
his
knuckles
anxious
to
stuff
himself
into
his
white
and

insularity

a
cherry
bomb
the
hell
out
of
him
grinned
hit
him
in
the
ass
once
grinned
at
the
detective
all
needed
was
to
throw
a
little
piece
of
red
wood
that
looked
like
a
firecracker
and
that
dumb
dog
would
run
for
his
life
the
dim
underwater
light
they
dressed
and
straightened
up
the
room
and
then
they
went
across
the
hall
to
the
kitchen

intimidated
by
the
stove

the
pilot

and
turned
on
one
of
the
burners
for
her
gas
flamed
up
two
inches
high
found
the
teakettle
put
water
on
to
boil
and
then
searched
through
the
icebox
sections
of
a
loaf
of
dark
bread
butter
jam
a
tiny
cake
of
ice
their
search
for
what
turned
out
to
be
the
right
breakfast
china
but
the
wrong
table

they
opened
every
cupboard

went
back
across
the
hall
to
their
bedroom

one
of
the
suitcases
and
took
out
powdered
coffee
and
sugar
appeared
with
the
teacart
and
he
opened
the
windows
you
want
to
call
but
it
was
not
really
a
question
and
so
he
left
the
room
walked
down
the
hall
to
the
front
of
the
apartment
hesitated
and
then
knocked
lightly
on
the
closed
door
of
the
study
sleepy
voice
answered
petit
dejeuner
said
in
an
accent
that
did
credit
to
his
teacher
the
same
time
his
voice
betrayed
uncertainty
about
their
being
here
and
conveyed
an
appeal
to
whatever
is
reasonable
and
dependable
in
everybody
ordinary
conversation
was
impossible
it
was
at
least
something
that
they
were
able
to
offer
the
sugar
bowl
with
their
sugar
in
it
and
the
plate
of
bread
and
butter
and
that
could
return
the
pitcher
of
hot
milk
to
them
handle
first
put
a
spoonful
of
powdered
coffee
into
his
cup
and
then
filled
it
with
hot
water

sorry
that
my
work
prevents
me
from
doing
anything
with
you
today
assured
him
that
they
did
not
expect
or
need
to
be
entertained
put
a
teaspoonful
of
powdered
coffee
in
his
cup
and
filled
it
with
hot
water
and
then
stirring
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
chair
creaked
time
he
moved
or
said
something
the
chair
creaked
again
was
not
entirely
silent
or
openly
rude
unless
asking
to
move
to
another
chair
and
placing
himself
in
the
fauteuil
that
creaked
so
alarmingly
was
an
act
of
rudeness
went
right
on
creaking
under
his
own
considerable
weight
and
all
it
needed
thought
was
for
somebody
to
fling
himself
back
in
a
fit
of
laughter
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
the
open
window
they
heard
sounds
below
in
the
street
cartwheels
a
tired
plodding
step
voices
indicated
the
photograph
on
the
wall
and
asked
what
church
the
stone
sculpture
was
in
told
him
and
he
promptly
forgot
passed
the
marmalade
the
bread
the
butter
back
and
forth
was
said
about
hotels
or
train
journeys
offered
his
car
to
use
at
any
time
he
cared
to
and
when
this
offer
was
not
accepted
the
armchair
creaked
all
three

another
cup
of
coffee
was

shrill
ring
of
the
telephone

out
into
the
hall
realized
that
he
had
no
idea
where
the
telephone
was
that
moment
the
bathroom
door
flew
open
and
came
out
with
his
face
lathered
for
shaving

strode
down
the
hall
tying
the
sash
of
his
dressing
gown

went

study
but
the
ringing
came
from

feet
of
cord
and
when
the
conversation
came
to
an
end
carried
the
instrument
with
him
the
whole
length
of
the
apartment
to
his
bathroom
where
it
rang
three
more
times
while
he
was
shaving
and
in
the
tub
he
left
the
apartment
he
knocked
on
their
door
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
for
them

few
minutes

handed
a
key
to
the

door
and
cautioned
him
against
leaving
it
unlocked
while
they
were
out
of
the

enough
time
had
elapsed
so
that
there
was
little
likelihood
of
his
returning
for
something
he
had
forgotten
went
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
looking
into
one
room
after
another
the
room
next
to
theirs
was
a
huge
cradle
of
mahogany
ornately
carved
and
decorated
with
gold
leaf
was
the
most
cradle
he
had
ever
seen
came
their
bathroom
and
then
a
bedroom
that
judging
by
the
photographs
on
the
walls
must
belong
to
young
woman
who
looked
like
with
her
two
children
and
on
their
wedding
day
photographs
in
oval
frames
of
and
an
elderly
man
who
must
be
grandfather
considerably
younger
and
very
different
schoolboy
a
man
whose
glance
direct
lifelike
and
mildly
accusing
was
contradicted
by
the
gilt
and
black
frame
was
the
kind
of
frame
that
is
only
put
around
the
photograph
of
a
dead
person
could
it
be
the
metal
shutters
closed
the
dining
room
was
so
dark
that
it
seemed
still
night
in
there
of
the
shutters
was
partly
open
and
he
made
out
the
shapes
of
chairs
and
sofas
which
seemed
to
be
upholstered
in
brown
or
russet
velvet
curtains
were
of
the
same
material
and
there
were
some
big
oil
paintings
portraits
in
the
style
of
and
taken
individually
the
big
rooms
were
or
seemed
to
be
square
the
apartment
as
a
whole
formed
a
triangle
apex
the
study
where
slept
was
light
and
bright
and
airy
and
cheerful
window
looked
out
on
the
it
was
the
only
window
of
the
apartment
that
did
around
slowly
he
saw
a
marble
fireplace
a
desk
a
low
bookcase
of
mahogany
with
brass
wire
instead
of
glass
panes
in
the
doors

with
its

with
a
pile
of
classical

beside
it

the
one
on

the

were

over
to
the
desk
and
stood
looking
at
the
papers
on
it
but
not
touching
anything
clock
on
the
mantel
piece
was
scandalized
and
ticked
so
loudly
that
he
glanced
at
it
over
his
shoulder
and
then
quickly
left
the
room
concierge
called
out
to
them
as
they
were
passing
through
the
foyer
quarters
were
on
the
right
as
you
walked
into
the
building
and
her
small
front
room
was
clogged
with
heavy
furniture
a
big
round
oak
dining
table
and
chairs
a
buffet
with
a
row
of
unclaimed
letters
inserted
between
the
mirror
and
its
frame
suitcases
had
come
while
they
were
out
and
had
been
put
in
their
room
the
concierge
said
waited
until
they
were
inside
the
elevator
and
then
said
what
do
we
do
the
guess
guess
than
sit
around
waiting
for
the
suitcases
to
be
delivered
they
had
gone
went
to
the
expecting
to
find
the
treasures
of
and
found
instead
a
duplication
of
that
long
double
row
of
booths
in
clothing
and
junk
of
every
sort
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
looked
even
so
at
everything
bought
some
cotton
aprons
and
bought
shoestrings
had
lunch
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
overlooking
the
intersection
of
two
broad
busy
unpicturesque
streets
and
coming
home
they
got
lost
in
the
it
took
them
over
an
hour
to
get
back
to
the
station
where
they
should
have
changed
in
order
to
take
the
line
that
went
to
the
was
the
end
of
the
afternoon
when
he
took
the
huge
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
inserted
it
into
the
keyhole
he
opened
the
door
there
stood
on
his
way
out
of
the
apartment
was
wearing
sneakers
and
shorts
and
an
shirt
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
little
black
bag
did
not
explain
where
he
was
going
and
they
did
not
ask
they
went
on
down
the
hall
to
their
room
you
think
he
could
be
having
an
affair
asked
as
they
heard
the
front
door
close
no
said
shocked
this
is
after
all
know
but
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
probably
spending
the
evening
with
friends
for
that
he
needs
a
little
bag
went
shopping
in
the
neighborhood
and
bought
two
loaves
of
bread
with
the
ration
coupons
they
had
been
given
in
and
some
cheese
and
a
dozen
eggs
and
a
bag
of
oranges
from
a
peddler
in
the
the
first
oranges
they
had
seen
since
they
landed
had
sitting
in
front
of
a
cafe
they
got
home
was
grateful
for
the
stillness
in
the
apartment
and
thought
how
under
different
circumstances
they
might
have
stayed
on
here
in
these
rooms
that
reminded
him
of
the
apartment
in
the
could
have
been
perfectly
happy
here
for
ten
whole
days
went
down
the
hall
to
bathroom
to
turn
on
the
heater
and
on
the
side
of
the
tub
he
saw
a
pair
of
blue
wool
swimming
trunks
felt
them
were
damp
reached
out
and
felt
the
bath
towel
hanging
on
the
towel
rack
over
the
tub
also
looked
around
the
room
and
then
called
out
here
quick
is
it
asked
standing
in
the
doorway
solved
the
mystery
of
the
little
bag
it
is
and
there
is
what
was
in
it
where
do
people
go
swimming
in
boat
in
the
river
maybe
boat
a
big
boat
anchored
near
the
with
a
swimming
pool
in
it
you
notice
it
if
he
has
time
to
go
swimming
he
had
time
to
be
with
us
looked
at
him
in
surprise
know
he
said
reading
her
mind
know
what
going
to
do
with
you
because
we
are
in
he
said
and
know
so
few
people
something
like
this
matters
more
than
it
would
at
home
he
was
so
nice
when
he
was
nice
because
feel
like
dancing
think
it
was
that
really
what
was
it
know
wish
did
tweed
coat
maybe
thing
about
is
that
very
proud
the
thing
about
hurt
feelings
the
wet
bathing
suit
pointed
out
is
that
the
person
who
has
them
is
not
quite
the
innocent
party
he
believes
himself
to
be
instance
what
about
all
those
people
went
toward
unhesitatingly
as
if
this
were
the
one
moment
they
would
ever
have
together
their
one
chance
of
knowing
each
other
the
embarrassing
questions
raised
by
objects
do
not
need
to
be
answered
or
we
would
all
have
to
go
sleep
in
the
open
fields
in
any
case
answers
may
clarify
but
they
do
not
change
anything
brought
with
him
a
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
of
about
a
hundred
weight
took
body
then
and
wrapped
it
in
with
the
spices
that
is
how
the
prepare
a
body
for
burial
as
present
at
the
were
sister
of
as
he
might
he
could
find
no
place
where
the
spoke
of
a
moment
when
could
have
been
alone
with
the
scene
was
crowded
with
mourners
such
as
the
dramatic
in
where
the
spectators
had
usurped
last
poignant
moment
his
concept
there
could
be
no
one
else
present
first
desire
was
to
create
a
mother
and
son
alone
in
the
universe
might
have
had
that
moment
to
hold
her
child
on
her
lap
after
the
soldiers
had
laid
him
on
the
ground
while
of
was
at
asking
for
body
was
gathering
his
mixture
of
myrrh
and
aloes
and
the
others
had
gone
home
to
mourn
who
saw
his
finished
would
take
the
place
of
the
biblical
witnesses
would
feel
what
was
undergoing
would
be
no
halos
no
angels
would
be
two
human
beings
whom
had
chosen
felt
close
to
having
spent
so
long
concentrating
on
the
beginning
of
her
journey
she
was
intensely
alive
anguished
her
son
was
dead
though
he
would
later
be
resurrected
he
was
at
this
moment
dead
indeed
the
expression
on
his
face
reflecting
what
he
had
gone
through
on
the
cross
his
sculpture
therefore
it
would
not
be
possible
for
him
to
project
anything
of
what
felt
for
his
mother
only
what
felt
for
her
son
inert
body
would
be
passive
his
eyes
closed
would
have
to
carry
the
human
communication
seemed
right
to
him
was
a
relief
to
shift
in
his
mind
to
technical
problems
his
was
to
be
life
size
how
was
to
hold
him
on
her
lap
without
the
relationship
seeming
ungainly
would
be
slender
of
limb
and
delicate
of
proportion
yet
she
must
hold
this
man
as
securely
and
convincingly
as
she
would
a
child
was
only
one
way
to
accomplish
this
by
design
by
drawing
diagrams
and
sketches
in
which
he
probed
the
remotest
corner
of
his
mind
for
creative
ideas
to
carry
his
concept
started
by
making
free
sketches
to
loosen
up
his
thinking
so
that
images
would
appear
on
paper
these
approximated
what
he
was
feeling
within
himself
the
same
time
he
started
walking
the
streets
peering
at
the
people
passing
or
shopping
at
the
stalls
storing
up
fresh
impressions
of
what
they
looked
like
how
they
moved
particular
he
sought
the
gentle
nuns
with
head
coverings
and
veils
coming
to
the
middle
of
their
foreheads
remembering
their
expressions
until
he
reached
home
and
set
them
down
on
paper
that
draperies
could
be
designed
to
serve
structural
purposes
he
began
a
study
of
the
anatomy
of
folds
improvised
as
he
went
along
completing
a
clay
figure
then
bought
yards
of
an
inexpensive
material
from
a
draper
wet
the
lightweight
cloth
in
a
basin
and
covered
it
over
with
clay
that
brought
from
the
bank
of
the
to
the
consistency
of
thick
mud
fold
could
be
accidental
each
turn
of
the
drapery
had
to
serve
organically
to
cover
the
slender
legs
and
feet
so
that
they
would
give
substantive
support
to
body
to
intensify
her
inner
turmoil
the
cloth
dried
and
stiffened
he
saw
what
adjustments
had
to
be
made

commented
wryly
when
he
had
sluiced
down
the
floor
for
a
week
making

if
you
control
the
way
these
folds
are
bunched
like
this
or
made
to
flow
you
can
enrich
the
body
attitudes
can
have
as
much
tactile
appeal

so
that

the

gravely
forbids
us
to
bow
down
to

to

why
our

for

asked

to

him
a

around

him
to

the

from
his

kept
him
from
bolting
at

showed
him
the
quick

for
two
hours
a
day
with
each
model
sent
by
the
rabbi
presented
quite
a
different
problem
this
sculpture
must
take
place
years
after
her
moment
of
decision
he
could
not
conceive
of
her
as
a
woman
in
her
old
wrinkled
broken
in
body
and
face
by
labor
or
worry
image
of
the
had
always
been
that
of
a
young
woman
even
as
had
his
memory
of
his
mother
introduced
him
into
several
homes
he
sketched
sitting
in
their
flowing
gowns
of
linen
and
silk
young
girls
not
yet
twenty
some
about
to
be
married
some
married
a
year
or
two
the
hospital
had
taken
only
men
he
had
had
no
experience
in
the
study
of
female
anatomy
but
he
had
sketched
the
women
of
in
their
fields
and
homes
was
able
to
discern
the
body
lines
of
the
women
under
their
robes
spent
concentrated
weeks
putting
his
two
figures
together
a
who
would
be
young
and
sensitive
yet
strong
enough
to
hold
her
son
on
her
lap
and
a
who
though
lean
was
strong
even
in
death
a
look
he
remembered
well
from
his
experience
in
the
dead
room
of
drew
toward
the
composite
design
from
his
meticulously
accurate
memory
without
need
to
consult
his
sketches
he
was
ready
to
go
into
a
figure
in
clay
he
would
have
free
expression
because
the
material
could
be
moved
to
distort
forms
he
wanted
to
emphasize
or
get
greater
intensity
he
added
or
subtracted
clay
he
turned
to
wax
because
there
was
a
similarity
of
wax
to
marble
in
tactile
quality
and
translucence
respected
each
of
these
approach
techniques
and
kept
them
in
character
his
quill
drawings
had
a
scratchiness
suggesting
skin
texture
the
clay
he
used
plastically
to
suggest
soft
moving
flesh
as
in
an
abdomen
in
a
reclining
torso
the
wax
he
smoothed
over
to
give
the
body
surface
an
elastic
pull
he
never
allowed
these
models
to
become
fixed
in
his
mind
they
remained
rough
starting
points
carving
he
was
charged
with
spontaneous
energy
too
careful
or
detailed
studies
in
clay
and
wax
would
have
glued
him
down
to
a
mere
enlarging
of
his
model
true
surge
had
to
be
inside
the
marble
itself
and
models
were
his
thinking
was
action
arrangement
with
was
working
well
except
that
sometimes
could
not
figure
who
was
master
and
who
apprentice
had
been
trained
so
rigorously
by
the
that
was
unable
to
change
his
habits
up
before
dawn
to
scrub
the
floors
whether
they
were
dirty

boiling
on
the
fire
for
washing
laundry
every

the
pots
scoured
with

this

the
wet

on

miles
into

in

over

in

stiffening
in

were
severed

nothing
left
but
her
duty
to
his
land
and
his
son
came
and
sat
mutely
with
her
sharing
her
pain
and
anguish
averting
his
eyes
from
the
ice
packs
on
her
bosom
and
kept
in
bed
a
week
until
her
milk
dried
she
returned
to
life
in
the
big
house
she
felt
shriveled
of
all
emotion
save
dedication
to
duty
disciplined
herself
daily
to
do
what
must
be
done
had
even
steeled
herself
to
keep
upstairs
in

room
off
the
empty
nursery
although
the
girl
tried
to
insist
on
moving
back
to
the
quarters
to
spare
remembrance
of
the
death
drooped
about
the
place
wearing
a
haunted
brooding
look
which
attributed
to
the
death
until
the
day
a
letter
came
for
her
addressed
to
bearing
a
postmark
the
slanting
hand
knew
uneasily
that
it
was
from
the
colonel

taken
and
from

moving
to
take

curiosity
and
foreboding
at
what
the

shared
the

for
many
years
and
they
needed
to

both
felt
deeply
and
with
a
sigh
they
fell
back
on
the
pillows

remaining
candles
with
a
long
snuffer

as
if
every

was
topped
by

in

with

his

hung
on

took
out
a
good
razor
a
present
from
found
tepid
water
in
a
pitcher
and
a
last
bit
of
soap
and
he
lathered
his

and
stood
stropping
the

on
his
broad
leather
belt
its
buckle
held
firm
by
a
knob
of

calumny
of

would
be
great
need
soon
for
his
skill
as
surgeon
but
somehow
he
had
not
planned
to
use
his
knowledge
merely
for
war
had
certain
psychic
intuitions
that
this
rebellion
was
not
wholly
what
it
appeared
on
the

knew
that
many
were
using
it
for
their

ends
it
did
not

stropped

what

was
that

could
understand
moral
aridity
of

them
loyal
usually
to
their
ledgers
some
like
would
bankrupt
themselves
for
the
new
ideas
circumstances
would
test
us
all
he
decided
and
ingratitude
would
occur
doubt
would
do
well

war
was
a
heaven
what
of
that
poor
tarred
and
feathered
wretch
he
had
seen
on

an

suddenly
for

he
could

the

his

so
desirable

lusty
so
full
of

shaving
washed
his
face
clean
of
lather
and
combed
and
retied
his
hair

proud
that
he
had
never
worn
a

and
more
of

were
wearing
their

and
not

did
not
have
to

it
by
thinking
too
much

could
be
tossed
outside

of

by
a
stray
bullet
these

began
to
pack
the
saddlebags
all
this
too
shall
pass
away
it
came
to
him
out
of
some
dim
corner
of
memory
from
a
church
service
when
he
was
a
boy
yes
in
a
white
church
with
a
thin
spur
steeple
in
the
patriarchal
where
a
feeling
of
plenitude
was
normal
in
those
manors
with
their
squires
leathered
men
and
wrinkled
women
in
drab
black
rags
carried
on
in
a
primitive
way
almost
unchanged
from
feudal
times
puzzled
wondered
how
they
could
go
on
in
poverty
superstition
ignorance
with
a
complete
lack
of
desire
to
make
either
their
land
or
their
lives
flourish
remembered
a
meeting
long
ago
had
returned
from
the
colonies
in
and
before
the
national
leadership
exalted
the
miracles
of
drying
up
swamps
and
irrigating
the
desert
drive
to
buy
tractors
and
machinery
was
launched
remembered
that
his
own
reaction
had
been
one
of
indifference
he
found
the
meaning
too
late
aggravated
him
land
of
the
was
rich
but
no
one
seemed
to
care
the
unfertile
land
in
humans
broke
their
backs
pushing

to
the
brink
had
sat
beside
at
the
rostrum
of
a
congress
of
of
them
were
there
in
this
loosely
knit
association
of
diversified
ideologies
and
each
berated
the
other
and
beat
his
breast
for
his
own
approaches
rose
to
speak
the
hall
became
silent
do
not
care
if
your
beliefs
take
you
along
a
path
of
religion
or
a
path
of
labor
or
a
path
of
activism
are
here
because
all
our
paths
travel
a
blind
course
through
a
thick
forest
seeking
human
dignity
the
forest
all
our
paths
merge
into
a
single
great
highway
which
ends
in
the
barren
eroded
hills
of

our
singular
goal
we
travel
through
the
forest
is
for
each
conscience
we
end
our
journey
is
always
the
same
all
seek
the
same
thing
through
different
ways
an
end
to
this
long
night
of
two
thousand
years
of
darkness
and
unspeakable
abuses
which
will
continue
to
plague
us
until
the
of
flies
over

how

sounded
good
to
but
he
did
not
believe
it
his
heart
he
had
no
desire
to
go
to
loathed
the
idea
of
drying
up
swamps
or
the
chills
of
malaria
or
of
leaving
his
natural
birthright

had
told
only

my
city
not
now
sat
on
a
train
on
the
way
to

wondered
if
he
was
not
being
punished
for
his
lack
of
belief
saw
the
smug
eyes
of
the
chief
and
all
the
and
the
faces
of
the
peasants
who
held
only
hatred
for
him
had
let
this
black
hole
of
death
in
heart
exist
without
a
cry
of
protest
there
had
been
big
glittering
rooms
where
bowed
and
kissed
the
hands
as
they
flirted
from
behind
their
fans
am
a
by

by

the
betrayal
gnawed
at
heart

his
teeth
together

himself

all
the
goddamned
sons
of
them

terrible

her
back
on

in

order
up
another
drink
am
she
said
forgotten
all
about
and
the
and
how
it
was
fifty
dollars
was
spending

just
me
and
getting
drunk
together
like
we
used
to
in
the
old
days
and
me
staring
at
her
across
the
table
crazy
to
get
my
hands
on
her
partly
because
wanted
to
wring
her
neck
because
she
was
so
ornery
but
mostly
because
she
was
so
wonderful
to
touch
or
sober
she
was
the
most
attractive
woman
in
the
world
for
me
was
crazy
about
her
all
over
again
was
the
call
of
the
wild
all
right
evening
turned
out
to
be
hell
like
all
the
others
moved
down
from
ginmill
to
ginmill
was
the
same
old
routine
got
to
dancing
just
a
little
tiny
dancing
step
to
a
hummed
tune
that
you
could
hardly
notice
and
trying
to
pick
up
strange
men
but
each
time
was
ready
to
say
to
hell
with
it
and
walk
out
pull
herself
together
and
talk
so
understandingly
in
that
sweet
husky
voice
about
the
good
times
and
the
happiness
had
together
and
there
was
back
on
the
hook
did
have
the
decency
to
call
up
and
tell
her
met
old
friends
and
would
be
home
late
could
scratch
her
eyes
out
cried
and
stamped
her
foot
when
came
back
from
the
phone
booth
know
like
my
men
to
have
other
women
hate
it
hate
it
got
so
drunk
had
to
take
her
home
was
a
walk
up
on
just
about
made
me
carry
her
upstairs
and
then
she
clung
to
me
and
let
me
go
was
a
jacket
on
the
chair
and
a
straw
hat
on
the
table
place
smelt
of
some
kind
of
hair
lotion
these
pimplike
characters
use
about
had
to
shake
her
to
make
her
listen
about
him
she
was
very
mysterious
and
dramatic
and
allow
each
other
absolute
freedom
are
above
being
jealous
used
to
me
bringing
home
strange
men
just
tell
him
my
husband
object
to
that
object
he
pokes
his
nose
in
here
slug
him
really
would
be
funny
began
to
laugh
was
still
laughing
when
grabbed
her
and
started
rolling
her
on
the
bed
all
made
of
flesh
and
blood
not
a
plaster
saint
up
was
horrible
in
my
life
have
felt
so
remorseful
about
anything
done
as
did
about
spending
that
night
with
my
own
wife
both
had
hangovers
declared
she
lift
her
head
from
the
pillow
lay
under
the
covers
making
jabbing
motions
with
her
forefinger
telling
me
where
to
look
for
the
coffeepot
was
stumbling
in
my
undershirt
trying
to
find
my
way
around
her
damn
kitchenette
when
smelt
that
sickish
sweet
hairtonic
smell
was
somebody
else
in
the
apartment
stiffened
could
feel
the
hair
stand
up
on
the
back
of
my
neck
like
a
that
is
going
to
get
into
a
fight
turned
around
with
the
percolator
in
my
hand
eyes
were
so
bleary
could
barely
see
him
but
there
he
was
a
little
smooth
olivefaced
guy
in
a
new
spring
overcoat
and
a
taffycolored
fedora
eyes
eyebrow
mustache
face
without
an
expression
in
the
world
have
time
to
speak
before
voice
was
screeching
at
us
from
the
bed
meet
meet
exhusband
gave
the
nastiest
laugh
ever
heard
either
of
you
forget
that
not
any
property
you
want
to
fight
go
down
on
the
sidewalk
was
enjoying
the
situation
that
was
a
psychologist
all
right
of
wanting
to
sock
the
poor
bastard
found
myself
having
a
fellowfeeling
for
him
he
felt
the
same
way
never
felt
such
a
lowdown
hound
in
my
life
thing
knew
he
was
in
the
kitchenette
cooking
up
the
breakfast
and
was
handing
her
coffeecup
and
she
was
lying
there
handsome
as
a
queen
among
her
courtiers
face
after
that
night
even
have
the
nerve
to
call
her
on
the
telephone
wrote
her
that
met
up
with
and
that
old
bonds
had
proved
too
strong
and
asked
her
to
send
my
clothes
down
by
express
course
had
to
give
her
address
but
she
never
came
near
us
she
did
was
write
me
a
pleasant
little
note
about
how
it
was
beautiful
while
it
lasted
but
that
now
life
had
parted
our
ways
and
it
was
goodbye
forever
never
said
a
word
about
the
fifty
dollars
added
a
postscript
begging
me
to
be
careful
about
drinking
must
know
that
that
was
my
greatest
weakness
underlined
three
times
learned
that
had
called
on
the
telephone
and
made
a
big
scene
about
trying
to
take
her
husband
away
finished
me
with
to
squeeze
all
the
drama
out
of
a
situation
there
was
shacked
up
with
in
that
filthy
fourth
floor
attic
on
use
the
phrase
advisedly
because
there
was
something
positively
indecent
about
our
relationship
felt
it
and
it
ate
on
me
all
the
time
but
know
how
right
was
till
later
did
know
was
that
was
always
around
slept
in
the
hall
bedroom
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
do
you
think
pays
the
rent
have
me
throw
the
poor
boy
out
on
the
street
said
when
needled
her
about
it
said
sure
that
was
what
wanted
her
to
do
but
she
paid
no
attention
had
a
wonderful
way
of
not
listening
to
things
she
want
to
hear
think
she
was
twotiming
me
with
right
then
be
on
the
safe
side
never
let
get
out
of
my
sight
day
or
night
had
me
worried
make
out
what
his
racket
was
thought
him
a
pimp
or
procurer
but
he
seem
to
be
was
smooth
and
civil
spoken
but
it
seemed
to
me
there
was
something
tough
under
his
selfeffacing
manner
he
let
treat
him
like
a
valet
the
place
was
cleaned
or
a
meal
served
it
was
who
did
the
work
never
could
find
out
what
his
business
was
always
seemed
to
have
money
in
his
pocket
phone
had
been
disconnected
but
telegrams
came
for
him
and
notes
by
special
messenger
and
then
he
would
disappear
for
several
days
was
all
he
would
say
with
that
smooth
hurt
smile
when
put
leading
questions
just
an
international
spy
would
shout
with
her
screechy
laugh
devil
he
have
been
too
happy
either
got
no
relief
from
drink
because
though
sometimes
would
buy
himself
a
drink
if
he
went
out
with
us
in
the
evening
leave
it
on
the
table
untouched
was
in
liquor
rode
him
pretty
hard
guess
if
pushed
him
too
far
give
me
a
look
out
of
narrowed
eyes
and
the
hard
cruel
bony
skull
would
show
through
that
smooth
face
of
his
day
told
that
guy
will
kill
us
both
just
listen
drunk
every
night
was
the
only
way
could
handle
the
situation
seemed
to
feel
the
same
way
still
had
that
much
in
common
trouble
was
drinking
cost
money
way
and
were
hitting
it
up
we
needed
ten
or
fifteen
dollars
an
evening
must
have
wheedled
a
little
out
of
raised
some
kale
by
hocking
the
good
clothes
had
left
over
from
my
respectable
uptown
life
but
when
that
was
gone
have
a
cent
know
what
we
would
have
done
if
come
to
town
looked
like
a
heavier
had
the
same
bullet
head
of
curly
reddish
hair
but
he
have
pokerfaced
humor
or
his
brains
or
his
charm
was
a
big
thick
beefy
violent
man
may
have
been
a
lecher
and
a
plugugly
but
he
was
a
good
churchgoing
and
he
loved
his
little
sister
had
that
clannishness
that
made
them
stick
together
in
spite
of
politics
and
everything
took
and
me
out
to
dinner
at
a
swell
steak
house
and
told
us
with
tears
in
his
eyes
how
happy
he
was
we
had
come
together
again
hath
joined
etcetera
were
real
religious
people
except
for
it
would
be
up
to
me
to
keep
the
little
girl
out
of
mischief
had
been
worried
as
hell
ever
since
lost
her
job
on
that
fashion
magazine
had
gone
big
with
the
girls
when
he
told
them
his
sister
was
an
editor
of
about
me
trying
to
help
her
get
her
job
back
evening
had
been
as
demure
as
a
little
girl
getting
ready
for
her
first
communion
just
about
blew
us
both
out
of
the
water
when
suddenly
came
out
with
what
she
came
out
with
brother
take
a
job
right
now
she
said
with
her
eyes
on
her
ice
cream
going
to
have
a
baby
baby
my
own
baby
first
thought
was
how
had
it
happened
so
soon
but
counted
back
on
my
fingers
and
sure
enough
been
living
together
six
weeks
meanwhile
was
bubbling
over
with
sentiment
thing
that
ever
happened
really
would
have
to
settle
down
to
love
honor
and
obey
and
have
to
quit
drinking
come
for
the
christening
by
he
would
we
separated
that
evening
pushed
a
hundred
dollar
bill
into
hand
to
help
towards
a
layette
he
left
town
saw
to
it
that
was
fixed
up
with
a
job
had
contacts
all
over
the
labor
movement
friend
of
named
had
just
muscled
into
the
portwatchers
were
retired
longshoremen
and
small
time
seafarers
off
towboats
and
barges
who
acted
as
watchmen
on
the
wharves
of
them
were
elderly
men
was
responsible
and
sometimes
dangerous
work
because
the
thieving
is
awful
in
the
port
of
as
well
paid
as
they
should
have
been
reason
the
portwatchers
let
take
them
over
was
to
get
the
protection
of
his
musclemen
needed
a
front
some
labor
stiff
with
a
clean
record
to
act
as
business
agent
of
the
local
was
a
retired
wobbly
and
structural
iron
worker
never
gouged
a
cent
off
a
fellow
worker
in
my
thirty
years
in
the
movement
once
radicalism
was
a
recommendation
wait
to
get
me
hired
my
gray
hair
and
my
weatherbeaten
countenance
certainly
looked
the
honest
working
stiff
things
a
man
will
do
for
a
woman
was
one
fact
which
could
not
overlook
one
truth
which
he
could
not
deny
long
as
there
were
two
human
beings
working
together
on
the
same
project
there
would
be
competition
and
you
could
no
more
escape
it
than
you
could
expect
to
escape
the
grave
matter
how
devoted
a
man
was
no
matter
how
fully
he
gave
his
life
to
the
he
could
never
extinguish
that
one
spark
of
pride
that
gave
him
definition
as
an
individual
of
the
jobs
in
the
mission
might
be
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
but
they
were
certainly
not
equal
in
the
eyes
of
the
servants
was
only
natural
that
would
strive
for
a
position
in
which
he
could
make
the
decisions
himself
was
prey
to
this
spirit
of
competition
and
he
knew
it
not
for
a
more
exalted
office
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
church
his
ambitions
for
the
bishopry
had
died
very
early
in
his
career
but
for
the
one
clear
victory
he
had
talked
about
to
the
colonel
was
not
sure
how
much
of
this
desire
was
due
to
his
devotion
to
the
church
and
how
much
was
his
own
ego
demanding
to
be
satisfied
for
the
two
were
intertwined
and
could
not
be
separated
wanted
desperately
to
see
defeated
the
in
the
village
rooted
out
the
mission
standing
triumphant
for
in
the
triumph
of
the
he
himself
would
be
triumphant
too
perhaps
this
was
a
part
of
the
eternal
plan
that
ambition
when
linked
with
would
be
a
driving
indefatigable
force
for
good
in
the
world
sighed
foolish
it
was
to
try
to
fathom
the
truth
in
an
area
where
only
faith
would
suffice
would
have
to
work
without
questioning
the
motives
which
made
him
work
and
content
himself
with
the
thought
that
the
eventual
victory
however
it
was
brought
about
would
be
sweet
indeed
first
move
was
to
send
to
the
village
to
spend
a
few
days
arm
had
been
giving
him
some
trouble
and
was
not
enough
of
a
medical
expert
to
determine
whether
it
had
healed
improperly
or
whether
was
simply
rebelling
against
the
tedious
work
in
the
print
shop
using
the
stiffness
in
his
arm
as
an
excuse
any
event
sent
him
to
the
local
hospital
to
have
it
checked
telling
him
to
keep
his
ears
open
while
he
was
in
the
village
to
see
if
he
could
find
out
what
was
planning
was
elated
at
the
prospect
was
allowed
to
spend
his
nights
at
an
inn
near
the
hospital
and
he
was
given
some
extra
money
to
go
to
the
pachinko
parlor
an
excellent
place
to
make
contact
with
the
enemy
left
with
all
the
joyous
spirit
of
a
child
going
on
a
holiday
nodding
attentively
as
gave
him
his
final
instructions
was
to
get
involved
in
no
arguments
he
was
to
try
to
make
no
converts
he
was
simply
to
listen
and
report
back
what
he
heard
was
a
ridiculous
situation
and
knew
it
for
frankly
partisan
openly
gregarious
would
make
a
poor
espionage
agent
he
wanted
to
know
anything
he
would
end
up
asking
about
it
but
in
this
guileless
manner
he
would
probably
receive
more
truthful
answers
than
if
he
tried
to
get
them
by
indirection
all
of
his
experience
in
the
mission
field
had
never
seen
a
convert
quite
like
the
moment
that
had
first
walked
into
the
mission
to
ask
for
a
job
any
job
his
qualifications
neatly
written
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
precise
hand
he
had
been
ready
to
become
a
had
already
been
studying
the
he
knew
the
fundamentals
and
after
studying
with
for
a
time
he
approached
announced
that
he
wanted
to
be
baptized
and
that
was
that
had
never
been
able
to
find
out
much
about
past
talked
very
little
about
himself
except
for
the
infrequent
times
when
he
used
a
personal
illustration
in
connection
with
another
subject
the
pieces
of
this
mosaic
together
had
the
vague
outlines
of
a
biography
was
the
fourth
son
of
an
elderly
farmer
who
lived
on
the
coast
in
and
divided
his
life
between
the
land
and
the
sea
supplementing
the
marginal
livelihood
on
his
small
rented
farm
with
seasonal
employment
on
a
fishing
boat
exception
brothers
turned
to
either
one
or
both
of
their
occupations
but
showed
a
talent
for
neither
and
instead
spent
most
of
his
time
on
the
beach
where
he
repaired
nets
and
proved
immensely
popular
as
a
storyteller
had
gone
into
the
navy
had
been
trained
as
an
officer
had
participated
in
one
or
two
battles
he
never
went
into
detail
regarding
his
military
experience
and
at
the
age
of
quite
as
a
bolt
out
of
the
blue
he
had
walked
into
the
mission
as
if
he
belonged
here
and
had
become
a
was
often
curious
often
tempted
to
ask
questions
but
he
never
did
and
when
decided
to
tell
him
about
his
experiences
he
would
do
so
unasked
had
no
doubt
that
would
come
back
from
the
village
bursting
with
information
ready
to
impart
it
with
his
customary
gusto
liberally
embellished
with
his
active
imagnation
the
telephone
rang
on
the
day
after
went
down
to
the
village
had
a
hunch
it
would
be
with
some
morsel
of
information
too
important
to
wait
until
his
return
for
there
were
few
telephones
in
the
village
and
the
phone
in
office
rarely
rang
unless
it
was
important
was
surprised
to
find
secretary
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
was
even
more
startled
when
he
heard
what
wanted
oyabun
was
entertaining
a
group
of
dignitaries
the
secretary
said
businessmen
from
for
the
most
part
and
wished
to
show
them
the
mission
had
never
seen
one
before
and
had
expressed
a
curiosity
about
it
said
guess
it
will
be
all
right
would
the
oyabun
like
to
bring
his
guests
up
here
afternoon
the
secretary
said
three
if
it
will
be
of
convenience
to
you
at
that
time
right
said
will
be
expecting
them
was
about
to
hang
up
the
phone
but
a
note
of
hesitancy
in
the
voice
left
the
conversation
open
had
something
more
to
say
beg
to
inquire
if
the
back
is
now
safe
for
travelers
he
said
laughed
despite
himself
the
oyabun
has
been
working
on
it
he
said
then
checked
himself
and
added
can
tell
that
the
back
road
is
in
very
good
condition
and
will
be
quite
safe
for
his
party
to
use
gosaimasu
secretary
sighed
with
relief
and
then
the
telephone
clicked
in
hand
had
no
idea
why
wanted
to
visit
the
mission
the
oyabun
to
make
such
a
trip
was
either
a
sign
of
great
weakness
or
an
indication
of
equally
great
confidence
and
from
all
the
available
information
it
was
probably
the
latter
must
feel
fairly
certain
of
his
victory
in
order
to
make
a
visit
like
this
a
trip
which
could
be
so
easily
misinterpreted
by
the
people
in
the
village
the
same
time
it
was
unlikely
that
any
businessmen
would
spend
a
day
in
a
mission
out
of
mere
curiosity
was
bringing
his
associates
here
for
a
specific
purpose
and
would
not
be
able
to
fathom
it
until
they
arrived
he
had
given
the
call
a
few
moments
thought
he
went
into
the
kitchen
to
ask
to
prepare
tea
and
sushi
for
the
visitors
using
the
formal
china
and
the
silver
tea
service
which
had
been
donated
to
the
mission
then
he
went
outside
to
inspect
the
grounds
had
a
pile
of
cuttings
near
one
side
of
the
lawn
asked
him
to
move
it
for
the
time
being
he
wanted
the
mission
compound
to
be
effortlessly
spotless
good
initial
impression
would
be
important
now
went
into
the
print
shop
where
had
just
finished
cleaning
the
press
many
pamphlets
do
we
have
in
stock
said
should
say
about
a
hundred
thousand
said
would
like
to
enact
a
little
tableau
this
afternoon
said
explained
about
the
visit
and
the
effect
he
wished
to
create
the
picture
of
a
very
busy
mission
did
not
wish
to
deceive
exactly
just
to
display
the
mission
activities
in
a
graphic
and
impressive
manner
nodded
as
he
listened
to
the
instructions
and
said
he
would
arrange
the
things
requested
next
stop
was
at
the
schoolroom
where
was
monitoring
a
test
beckoned
to
her
from
the
door
and
she
slipped
quietly
outside
told
her
of
the
visitors
and
then
of
his
plans
many
children
do
you
have
present
today
said
looked
back
toward
the
schoolroom
she
said
only
fourteen
little
girl
had
had
to
go
home
has
a
pretty
bad
cold
would
like
them
to
appear
very
busy
today
not
busy
exactly
but
joyous
exuberant
full
of
life
want
to
create
the
impression
of
a
compound
full
of
children
you
think
you
can
manage
it
smiled
try
was
walking
back
toward
the
residential
hall
came
out
of
the
basement
and
bounded
up
to
him
altercation
in
the
coffee
house
had
done
little
to
dampen
his
spirits
but
he
was
still
a
little
wary
around
for
they
had
not
yet
discussed
the
incident
think
fixed
the
pump
so
we
have
to
worry
about
it
for
a
long
time
he
said
adjusted
the
gauge
so
that
the
pump
cuts
out
before
the
water
gets
too
low
said
looked
out
over
the
expanse
of
the
compound
was
going
to
take
a
lot
of
activity
to
fill
it
you
ever
operated
a
transit
said
sir
said
are
about
to
become
a
surveyor
said
gets
back
with
the
jeep
want
you
to
round
up
two
or
three
boys
can
help
you
find
an
old
transit
in
the
basement
glass
is
out
of
it
but
that
matter
looks
pretty
efficient
and
the
important
thing
went
on
to
explain
what
he
had
in
mind
nodded
said
he
could
do
it
was
warming
to
his
strategy
by
the
time
he
got
back
to
the
residential
hall
was
rather
a
childish
game
all
in
all
but
everybody
seemed
to
be
getting
into
the
spirit
of
the
thing
and
he
could
not
remember
when
he
had
enjoyed
planning
anything
quite
so
much
was
not
sure
what
effect
it
would
have
but
that
was
really
beside
the
point
when
you
got
right
down
to
it
was
not
going
to
lose
the
mission
by
default
and
whatever
reason
had
for
bringing
his
little
group
to
the
mission
he
was
going
to
be
in
for
a
surprise
found
in
the
parlor
and
asked
her
to
make
sure
everything
was
in
order
in
the
residential
hall
and
then
to
take
charge
of
the
office
while
the
party
was
here
everything
had
been
done
went
back
to
his
desk
to
occupy
himself
with
his
monthly
report
until
three
two
thirty
he
sent
to
the
top
of
the
wall
at
the
northeast
corner
of
the
mission
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
ridge
road
and
give
a
signal
when
he
first
glimpsed
the
approach
of
party
attired
in
his
best
blue
serge
suit
sat
in
a
chair
out
on
the
lawn
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
smoking
a
cigarette
and
waiting
air
was
cooler
here
and
the
lacy
pattern
of
the
trees
threw
a
dappled
shadow
on
the
grass
an
effect
which
he
found
pleasant
concluded
by
asking
him
to
name
another
hour
should
this
one
be
inconvenient
fish
took
the
bait
replied
that
he
could
not
imagine
what
importance
there
might
be
in
thus
meeting
with
a
stranger
but
joy
of
joys
he
would
be
at
home
at
the
hour
mentioned
when
she
called
he
had
thought
better
of
the
matter
and
decided
not
to
involve
himself
in
a
new
entanglement
was
told
by
the
manservant
who
opened
the
door
that
his
lordship
was
engaged
on
work
from
which
he
had
left
strict
orders
he
was
not
to
be
disturbed
was
bitterly
disappointed
but
determined
not
to
let
the
rebuff
daunt
her
purpose
wrote
again
and
now
abandoning
for
the
moment
the
theme
of
love
she
asked
for
help
in
the
matter
of
her
career
could
act
and
she
could
write
lordship
was
concerned
in
the
management
of
but
if
there
were
no
opportunities
there
would
he
read
and
criticize
her
novel
last
he
consented
to
meet
her
and
following
that
brief
interview
wrote
him
a
yet
more
remarkable
proposal
you
any
objection
to
the
following
plan
evening
we
may
go
out
of
town
together
by
some
stage
or
mail
about
the
distance
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
we
shall
be
free
and
unknown
we
can
return
the
following
morning
concluded
by
asking
for
a
brief
interview
to
settle
with
you
where
and
she
threw
in
a
tribute
to
his
gentle
manners
and
the
wild
originality
of
your
countenance
opened
his
reply
with
trembling
fingers
he
agreed
he
would
see
her
that
evening
at
last
their
meeting
he
told
her
not
to
bother
about
where
he
would
attend
to
that
was
one
of
the
new
in
the
room
and
as
rose
to
go
he
asked
her
to
sing
him
one
song
before
she
left
sang
him
charming
ballad
which
was
the
vogue
of
the
moment
had
never
sung
better
voice
is
delightful
he
approved
with
a
warm
smile
will
be
a
new
experience
have
never
before
made
love
to
a
nightingale
have
been
cooing
doves
chattering
magpies
thieving
jackdaws
a
proud
peacock
a
silly
goose
and
a
harpy
eagle
whom
was
silly
enough
to
mate
with
and
who
is
now
busy
tearing
at
my
vitals
so
they
went
he
choosing
of
all
places
an
inn
near
scene
a
generation
ago
of
the
obscene
orgies
of
the
regaled
with
an
account
of
the
mock
mass
performed
by
the
cassocked
bloods
which
he
had
had
at
firsthand
from
old
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
wore
the
monkish
scourge
at
his
waist
but
this
it
seems
was
not
employed
for
girls
danced
in
the
chancel
of
the
the
youngest
and
seemingly
the
most
innocent
being
chosen
to
read
a
sermon
filled
with
veiled
depravities
jaded
amorist
conjured
up
pictures
of
the
blasphemous
rites
with
relish
all
that
belonged
to
the
age
of
and
abbot
and
beadsman
of
the
casual
seduction
of
a
bluestocking
seemed
tame
by
comparison
passed
close
by
the
turn
to
scant
half
mile
away
and
were
doubtless
sitting
on
their
diminutive
terrace
the
air
about
them
scented
with
stock
and
listening
to
the
nightingale
who
had
nested
in
the
big
lime
tree
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
and
peaceful
but
what
were
charm
and
peace
compared
to
high
adventure
with
the
fabulous
many
women
had
longed
for
the
privilege
that
was
hers
was
she
to
behave
wondered
be
passive
to
be
girlishly
shy
was
palpably
absurd
was
the
pursuer
as
clearly
as
was
in
poem
while
her
did
not
suffer
from
inexperience
satiety
might
well
be
an
equal
handicap
she
would
not
pretend
modesty
but
neither
must
she
be
crudely
bold
that
was
the
thing
the
bedroom
she
would
insist
on
darkness
his
club
foot
he
might
well
be
grateful
the
inn
which
was
situated
close
to
a
broad
weir
was
greeted
by
the
landlord
with
obsequious
deference
and
addressed
as
milord
place
was
evidently
a
familiar
haunt
and
wondered
what
other
illicit
loves
had
been
celebrated
in
the
comfortable
rooms
to
which
they
were
shown

in
the
sitting
room

the

to
me
last
time
was
here
the
grate
bellowed
out

as
it
might
have
been
preparing
us
for

some
owls

built

promise
you
never
have
trouble
of
that
sort
again
not
only
had
he
been
here
before
but
it
seemed
he
might
well
come
again
felt
suddenly
small
and
cheap
heroine
of
a
trivial
episode
in
the
voluminous
history
of
cold
supper
was
ordered
and
a
bottle
of
port
ship
had
borne
him
to
wines
had
started
to
cross
the
the
first
shipments
in
a
dozen
years
but
the
supplies
had
not
yet
reached
rural
hostelries
where
the
sweet
wines
of
the
peninsula
still
ruled
they
waited
for
supper
they
sat
by
the
fire
glasses
in
hand
while
philosophized
as
much
for
his
own
entertainment
as
hers
is
overpriced
he
said
great
tragedies
are
concerned
with
man
against
not

the
prize
of

yourself
as
a

this
little
adventure
is
an
event
of
major
importance

to

pretty
important

the

you

about
how

what
she

to

nothing
ask
you

unfaithful

a

she
thought
of
answering
with
the
truth
but
she
knew
there
were
men
who
shied
away
from
virginity
who
demanded
some
degree
of
education
in

as
well
as

well
she
said
not
catechize
you

the
others
so
long
as

my
place
in

was
striking
the
right
note
man
ever

a
better
opinion
of
himself

indeed
with
one
so
favored
flattery
could
hardly
seem
overdone

to
him
and
slipping
an

about
his

sat
on
his
knee
drew
her
close
and

on

turned
her
face
to
his

went
to
her
shoulder
and
pushed
aside
the
knotted
scarf
that
surmounted
the

then
to
better

he
took
hold
of
the
knot
and
with
dextrous
fingers
untied
it

beneath

buttoned
and
withdrawing
his
lips
from
hers
he
set
her
upright
on
his
knee
and
started
to
undo
it
unhurriedly
as
if
she
were
a
child
kindled
by
his
kiss
his
caressing
hand
her
desire
was
aflame
sprang
up
and
went
swiftly
to
the
bedroom
poured
himself
another
glass
of

her
spirit
is
the
most
challenging
loveliness
in
all
nature

she
longed
to
tell
them
she
had
become
mistress
odd
coincidence
on
the
evening
of
her
return
chose
to
read
which
was
the
latest
of
the
titled
successes
he
declaimed
the
sonorous
measures
it
was
as
much
as
could
do
to
restrain
herself
from
bursting
out
with
her
dramatic
tidings
it
is
not
the
best
of
which
he
is
capable
said
as
he
closed
the
book
it
is
still
poetry
of
a
high
order
he
would
only
leave
the
said

tired
of

hero
of
his
next

slightly
overdone
carelessness

his
most
bitter
detractor
a
pardonable
irony
wrote
to
the
father
who
had
publicly
disowned
his

probably
be
glad
to
hear
that

careless

all

slammed
in

face
previous
scandals
gaily
diverting
as
they
were
had
only
served
to
increase
his
popularity
under
the
impact
of
his
disclosures
he
was
brought
suddenly
to
the
realization
that
there
was
a
limit
to
tolerance
however
brilliant
however
the
offender
might
be
tried

and
openly
flaunted
his
devotion
to
his
half
sister

he
soon
saw
as
did
she
that
this
course
if
persisted
in
would
involve
them
in
a
common
ruin
the
moment
there
was
no
woman
in
his
life
and
it
was
this
vacuum
that
had
given
her
opportunity
the
liaison
successfully
started
in
the
last
days
of
autumn
was
now
languishing
since
the
separation
from
his
wife
had
been
living
in
a
smallish
house

to
bring
to
it

an
occasional
visitor

every
move

spies

the
pass

the
colonel
had
thought
that
the
suggestion
of
taking
it
himself
would
tip
the
colonel
in
the
direction
of
serving
his
own
order
but
the
slip
of
paper
was
folded
and
absently
thrust
into
the
belt
his
yearning
the
colonel
would
not
go
down
to

the
boat
had
touched
the
weaker
ones
and
the
two
wounded
men
had
been
lifted
out
and
carried
away
by
the
soldiers
had
presented
his
pouch
and
been
led
to
the
bombproof
officer
had
told
him
that
both
lists
must
be
checked
had
given
his
name
and
asked
for
a
pass
officer
surprised
said
he
would
have
to
see
had
nodded
absently
and
muttered
that
he
would
check
the
lists
himself
later
had
peered
through
the
darkness
at
the
rampart
men
he
would
take
back
across
the
river
stood
there
but
he
turned
away
from
them
wanted
no
part
of
the
emotions
of
the
exchange
no
memory
of
the
joy
and
gratitude
that
other
men
felt
had
hoped
to
be
alone
in
the
bombproof
but
the
soldier
had
followed
him
carefully
ignored
the
man
he
could
not
deny
his
presence
it
would
be
better
to
speak
to
him
since
silence
could
not
exorcise
his
form
glanced
briefly
at
him
seeing
only
a
body
rigidly
erect
behind
the
languid
banner
be
too
long
my
pass
is
approved
may
be
a
half
hour
soldier
answered
in
a
curious
muffled
voice
his
lips
barely
moving
turned
away
and
did
not
see
the
knees
buckle
and
his
body
sag
sir
had
acknowledged
the
man
was
easier
to
think
now
decided
stiff
figure
in
the
corner
no
longer
blocked
his
thoughts
paced
slowly
stooping
staring
at
the
damp
slippery
floor
tried
to
order
the
words
of
the
three
officers
seeking
to
create
some
coherent
portrait
of
the
dead
boy
he
groped
blindly
lack
of
success
steadily
eroded
his
interest
stopped
pacing
leaned
against
the
dank
timbered
wall
and
let
his
mind
drift
feeling
of
futility
an
enervation
of
mind
greater
than
any
fatigue
he
had
ever
known
seeped
through
him
in
the
name
of
was
he
doing
crouched
in
a
timbered
pit
on
the
wrong
bank
of
the
river
had
he
crossed
the
dark
water
to
bring
back
a
group
of
reclaimed
soldiers
or
to
skulk
in
a
hole
grew
annoyed
and
at
the
same
time
surprised
at
that
emotion
was
conscious
of
a
growing
sense
of
absurdity
had
written
it
all
out
he
the
report
official
enough
did
he
hope
to
accomplish
here
had
ordered
him
not
to
leave
the
far
bank
by
a
guilty
urge
he
had
disobeyed
the
order
of
a
man
he
respected
what
tell
something
he
would
find
out
for
himself
figure
in
the
corner
belched
loudly
a
deep
liquid
eruption
snorted
and
then
laughed
aloud
voice
was
muffled
again
stricken
with
chagrin
clutched
the
staff
and
his
dark
eyes
blinked
apologetically
me
sir
get
out
of
here
ran
up
the
ladder
and
stood
for
a
second
sucking
in
the
cool
air
that
smelled
of
mud
and
river
weeds
his
left
the
two
skiffs
dented
their
sharp
bows
into
the
soft
bank
boat
swung
slowly
to
the
pull
of
the
current
soldier
held
the
end
of
a
frayed
rope
guards
appeared
carrying
their
rifles
at
ready
stared
at
them
curiously
were
stocky
men
well
fed
and
with
neat
uniforms
and
sturdy
boots
them
shambled
a
long
column
of
weak
tattered
men
thin
gray
figures
raised
a
hoarse
cawing
cry
like
the
call
of
a
bird
flock
moved
toward
the
skiffs
with
shocking
eagerness
elbowing
and
shoving
men
were
knocked
down
but
did
not
attempt
to
rise
crept
down
the
muddy
slope
toward
the
waiting
boats
soldiers
grounded
arms
and
settled
into
healthy
indifferent
postures
to
watch
the
feeble
boarding
of
the
skiffs
crawling
men
tried
to
rise
and
fell
again
one
moved
to
them
watched
two
of
them
flounder
into
the
shallow
water
and
listened
to
their
voices
beg
shrilly
a
confused
soaked
and
stumbling
shift
of
bodies
and
lifting
arms
the
two
men
were
dragged
into
the
same
skiff
third
crawling
man
forced
himself
erect
swayed
like
a
drunkard
his
arms
milling
in
slow
circles
paced
forward
unsteadily
leaning
too
far
back
his
head
tilted
oddly
steps
were
short
and
stiff
and
with
his
head
thrown
back
his
progress
was
a
supercilious
strut
appeared
to
be
peering
haughtily
down
his
nose
at
the
crowded
and
unclean
vessel
that
would
carry
him
to
freedom
stalked
into
the
water
and
fell
heavily
over
the
side
of
the
barge
his
weight
nearly
swamping
the
craft
looked
for
the
fourth
man
had
reached
the
three
passive
guards
he
crept
in
an
incertain
manner
patting
the
ground
before
him
guards
did
not
look
at
him
figure
on
the
earth
halted
seemingly
bewildered
sank
back
on
his
thin
haunches
like
a
weary
hound
he
began
to
crawl
again
watched
the
creeping
figure
felt
a
spectator
interest
the
man
make
it
or
not
only
there
was
a
clock
for
him
to
crawl
against
he
failed
to
reach
the
riverbank
in
five
minutes
say
then
the
skiffs
would
pull
away
and
leave
him
groping
in
the
mud
three
minutes
to
make
it
sporting
the
guards
did
not
move
but
stood
inert
aloof
from
the
man
figure
halted
and
gasped
man
began
to
creep
in
the
wrong
direction
deceived
by
a
slight
rise
in
the
ground
turned
slowly
and
began
to
crawl
back
up
the
bank
toward
the
rampart
raced
for
him
his
boots
slamming
the
soft
earth
guards
came
to
life
with
astonishing
menace
spun
and
flung
their
rifles
up
gesticulated
wildly
man
dropped
to
his
knee
for
better
aim
me
help
him
for
the
love
of
guards
lowered
their
rifles
and
their
rifles
and
peered
at
with
sullen
puzzled
faces
pounded
to
the
crawling
man
and
stopped
panting
heavily
reached
down
and
closed
his
fingers
on
the
upper
arm
his
clutch
a
flat
strip
of
muscle
surged
on
the
bone
bent
awkwardly
and
lifted
the
man
to
his
feet
stared
into
a
cadaverous
face
clotted
balls
the
color
of
mucus
rolled
between
fiery
lids
sticks
of
fingers
the
tips
gummy
with
dark
earth
patted
at
throat
voice
was
a
sweet
patient
whisper
said
that
take
my
arm
and
get
me
right
there
you
no
matter
it
far
far
could
it
be
thought
bleakly
how
far
can
a
blind
man
crawl
body
length
or
all
the
rest
of
his
nighted
life
far
talk
deep
like
us
fellas
raises
the
voice
bein
in
camp
yes
on
now
you
walk
course
can
can
walk
real
good
stumbled
down
the
bank
man
leaned
his
frail
body
against
shoulder
was
no
heavier
than
a
child
paused
for
breath
man
wheezed
weakly
his
fetid
breath
beating
softly
against
neck
sweet
whisper
came
after
great
effort
wish
you
was
promised
to
take
me
hush
almost
there
supported
the
man
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
passed
the
frail
figure
over
the
bow
of
the
nearest
skiff
man
swayed
on
a
thwart
turning
his
ruined
eyes
from
side
to
side
turned
away
sickened
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
heard
the
patient
voice
calling
are
you
him
lie
down
snatched
a
deep
breath
had
not
meant
to
shout
stood
with
his
back
to
the
skiff
men
mewed
and
scratched
begging
to
be
taken
away
spoke
bewilderedly
to
the
dark
night
flecked
with
torches
you
do
you
do
to
them
jabbed
at
him
accusingly
was
angry
sickened
had
not
felt
that
during
the
afternoon
nor
later
his
emotions
had
been
inward
war
on
a
night
like
this
it
was
only
the
outward
emotions
that
mattered
what
could
be
flung
out
into
the
darkness
to
damage
others
was
it
was
sure
of
it
type
of
man
allowed
this
sort
of
thing
to
happen
a
fool
he
had
been
to
think
of
his
brother
was
dead
did
it
matter
name
had
been
crossed
off
a
list
his
cool
body
lay
in
the
ground
words
had
any
meaning
had
he
thought
of
to
go
to
grovel
and
beg
understanding
confess
with
a
canvas
chair
as
a
gouging
at
his
heart
until
a
rough
and
stupid
hand
bade
him
rise
and
go
were
slaughtered
every
day
tumbled
into
eternity
like
so
many
torn
parcels
flung
down
a
portable
chute
made
him
think
had
a
right
to
witness
his
humiliation
right
had
to
any
special
consideration
better
more
deserving
hell
with
him
chafe
with
impatience
to
see
rip
open
the
note
with
trembling
hands
and
read
the
formal
report
in
beautiful
hand
would
curse
believed
that
brave
boys
cry
spat
on
the
ground
was
grimly
satisfied
had
stupidly
thought
himself
compelled
to
ease
his
pain
he
knew
perfectly
that
he
had
but
longed
to
increase
his
own
suffering
would
not
want
to
be
one
of
those
writers
who
begin
each
morning
by
exclaiming
and
what
would
you
have
made
of
a
bomb
shelter
ornamented
with
four
ducks
a
birdbath
and
three
composition
gnomes
with
long
beards
and
red
mobcaps
say
want
to
begin
a
day
like
this
but
often
wonder
what
the
dead
would
have
done
the
shelter
is
as
much
a
part
of
my
landscape
as
the
beech
and
trees
that
grow
on
the
ridge
can
see
it
from
this
window
where
write
was
built
by
the
and
stands
on
the
acre
of
ground
that
adjoins
our
property
bulks
under
a
veil
of
thin
new
grass
like
some
embarrassing
fact
of
physicalness
and
think
set
out
the
statuary
to
soften
its
meaning
would
have
been
like
her
was
a
pale
woman
on
her
terrace
sitting
in
her
parlor
sitting
anywhere
she
ground
an
axe
of
her
a
cup
of
tea
and
she
would
say
these
cups
look
just
like
a
set
gave
to
the
last
year
her
the
new
swimming
pool
and
she
would
say
slapping
her
ankle
suppose
this
must
be
where
you
breed
your
gigantic
mosquitoes
her
a
chair
and
she
would
say
a
nice
imitation
of
those
chairs
inherited
from
trumps
were
more
touching
than
they
were
anything
else
and
seemed
to
imply
that
the
nights
were
long
her
children
ungrateful
and
her
marriage
bewilderingly
threadbare
years
ago
she
would
have
been
known
as
a
golf
widow
and
the
sum
of
her
manner
was
perhaps
one
of
bereavement
usually
wore
weeds
and
a
stranger
watching
her
board
a
train
might
have
guessed
that
was
dead
but
was
far
from
dead
was
marching
up
and
down
the
locker
room
of
the
shouting
throw
a
little
nuclear
hardware
at
them
and
show
them
boss
was
brigadier
of
the
light
infantry
and
at
one
time
or
another
declared
war
on
and
all
began
on
an
autumn
afternoon
and
who
after
all
these
centuries
can
describe
the
fineness
of
an
autumn
day
might
pretend
never
to
have
seen
one
before
or
to
more
purpose
that
there
would
never
be
another
like
it
clear
and
searching
sweep
of
sun
on
the
lawns
was
like
a
climax
of
the
lights
were
burning
somewhere
and
the
smoke
smelled
for
all
its
ammoniac
acidity
of
beginnings
boundless
blue
air
was
stretched
over
the
zenith
like
the
skin
of
a
drum
her
house
one
late
afternoon
stopped
to
admire
the
light
was
the
day
to
canvass
for
infectious
hepatitis
had
been
given
sixteen
names
a
bundle
of
literature
and
a
printed
book
of
receipts
was
her
work
to
go
among
her
neighbors
and
collect
their
checks
house
stood
on
a
rise
of
ground
and
before
she
got
into
her
car
she
looked
at
the
houses
below
as
she
knew
it
was
complex
and
reciprocal
and
almost
every
roof
she
saw
signified
charity
worked
for
the
brain
did
mental
health
worked
for
the

in
charge
of
diseases
of
the

and

was

of
was
cancer
and
did
the
kidney
led
the
birthcontrol
league

arthritis
and
way
in
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
slate
roof
of
house
a
roof
that
signified
gout
undertook
the
work
of
going
from
house
to
house
with
the
thoughtless
resignation
of
an
honest
and
traditional
laborer
was
her
destiny
it
was
her
life
mother
had
done
it
before
her
and
even
her
old
grandmother
who
had
collected
money
for
smallpox
and
unwed
mothers
had
telephoned
most
of
her
neighbors
in
advance
and
most
of
them
were
ready
for
her
experienced
none
of
the
suspense
of
some
poor
stranger
selling
encyclopedias
and
there
she
stayed
to
visit
and
drink
a
glass
of
sherry
contributions
were
ahead
of
what
she
had
got
the
previous
year
and
while
the
money
of
course
was
not
hers
it
excited
her
to
stuff
her
kit
with
big
checks
stopped
at
the
after
dusk
and
had
a
stayed
too
late
and
when
she
left
it
was
dark
and
time
to
go
home
and
cook
supper
for
her
husband
got
a
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
for
the
hepatitis
fund
she
said
excitedly
when
he
walked
in
did
everybody
on
my
list
but
the
and
the
want
to
get
my
kit
in
tomorrow
morning
would
you
mind
doing
them
while
cook
the
dinner
know
the
said
does
but
they
gave
me
ten
last
year
was
tired
he
had
his
business
worries
and
the
sight
of
his
wife
arranging
pork
chops
in
the
broiler
only
seemed
like
an
extension
of
a
boring
day
was
happy
enough
to
take
the
convertible
and
race
up
the
hill
to
the
thinking
that
they
might
give
him
a
drink
the
were
away
their
maid
gave
him
an
envelope
with
a
check
in
it
and
shut
the
door
in
at
the
driveway
he
tried
to
remember
if
he
had
ever
met
them
name
encouraged
him
because
he
always
felt
that
he
could
handle
the
was
a
glass
pane
in
the
front
door
and
through
this
he
could
see
into
a
hallway
where
a
plump
woman
with
red
hair
was
arranging
flowers
hepatitis
he
shouted
heartily
took
a
good
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
before
she
turned
and
walking
with
very
small
steps
started
toward
the
door
please
come
in
she
said
girlish
voice
was
nearly
a
whisper
was
not
a
girl
he
could
see
hair
was
dyed
and
her
bloom
was
fading
and
she
must
have
been
crowding
forty
but
she
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
women
who
cling
to
the
manners
and
graces
of
a
pretty
child
of
eight
wife
just
called
she
said
separating
one
word
from
another
exactly
like
a
child
am
not
sure
that
have
any
cash
any
money
that
is
but
if
you
will
wait
just
a
minute
will
write
you
out
a
check
if
can
find
my
checkbook
you
step
into
the
living
room
where
cozier
fire
had
just
been
lighted
he
saw
and
things
had
been
set
out
for
drinks
and
like
any
stray
his
response
to
these
comforts
was
instantaneous
was
he
wondered
home
on
a
late
train
his
clothes
upstairs
a
shower
the
end
of
the
room
there
was
a
desk
heaped
with
papers
and
she
began
to
riffle
these
making
sighs
and
and
noises
of
girlish
exasperation
am
terribly
sorry
to
keep
you
waiting
she
said
but
you
make
yourself
a
little
drink
while
you
wait
on
the
table
train
does
come
out
on
is
away
she
said
voice
dropped
has
been
away
for
six
weeks
have
a
drink
then
if
have
one
with
me
you
will
promise
to
make
it
weak
down
he
said
and
enjoy
your
drink
and
look
for
your
checkbook
later
only
way
to
find
things
is
to
relax
in
all
they
had
six
drinks
described
herself
and
her
circumstances
unhesitatingly
manufactured
plastic
tongue
depressors
travelled
all
over
the
world
like
to
travel
made
her
feel
faint
and
in
where
she
had
gone
that
summer
she
had
been
given
raw
fish
for
breakfast
and
so
she
had
come
straight
home
and
her
husband
had
formerly
lived
in
where
she
had
many
friends
but
thought
the
country
would
be
safer
in
case
of
war
would
rather
live
in
danger
than
die
of
loneliness
and
boredom
had
no
children
she
had
made
no
friends
seen
you
though
before
she
said
with
enormous
coyness
patting
his
knee
seen
you
walking
your
dogs
on
and
driving
by
in
the
convertible
thought
of
this
lonely
woman
sitting
at
her
window
touched
him
although
he
was
even
more
touched
by
her
plumpness
plumpness
he
knew
is
not
a
vital
part
of
the
body
and
has
no
procreative
functions
serves
merely
as
an
excess
cushion
for
the
rest
of
the
carcass
knowing
its
humble
place
in
the
scale
of
things
why
did
he
at
this
time
of
life
seem
almost
ready
to
sell
his
soul
for
plumpness
remarks
she
made
about
the
sufferings
of
a
lonely
woman
seemed
so
broad
at
first
that
he
know
what
to
make
of
them
but
after
the
sixth
drink
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
suggested
that
they
go
upstairs
and
look
for
her
checkbook
there
never
done
this
before
she
said
later
when
he
was
arranging
himself
to
leave
voice
shook
with
feeling
and
he
thought
it
lovely
doubt
her
truthfulness
although
he
had
heard
the
words
a
hundred
times
never
done
this
before
they
always
said
shaking
their
dresses
down
over
their
white
shoulders
never
done
this
before
they
always
said
waiting
for
the
elevator
in
the
hotel
corridor
never
done
this
before
they
always
said
pouring
another
whiskey
never
done
this
before
they
always
said
putting
on
their
stockings
ships
at
sea
on
railroad
trains
in
summer
hotels
with
mountain
views
they
always
said
never
done
this
before
have
you
been
asked
sadly
when
he
came
in
after
eleven
had
a
drink
with
the
told
me
he
was
in
came
home
unexpectedly
ate
some
supper
in
the
kitchen
and
went
into
the
room
to
hear
the
news
them
shouted
a
little
nuclear
hardware
at
them
them
boss
in
bed
he
had
trouble
sleeping
thought
first
of
his
son
and
daughter
away
at
college
loved
them
was
the
only
meaning
of
the
word
that
he
had
ever
known
he
played
nine
imaginary
holes
of
golf
choosing
his
handicap
his
irons
his
stance
his
opponents
and
his
weather
in
detail
but
the
green
of
the
links
seemed
faded
in
the
light
of
his
business
worries
money
was
tied
up
in
a
hotel
an
pottery
works
and
a
detergent
for
and
luck
had
been
running
against
him
worries
harried
him
up
out
of
bed
and
he
lighted
a
cigarette
and
went
to
the
window
the
starlight
he
could
see
the
trees
stripped
of
their
leaves
the
summer
he
had
tried
to
repair
some
of
his
losses
at
the
track
and
the
bare
trees
reminded
him
that
his
tickets
would
still
be
lying
like
leaves
in
the
gutters
near
and
and
ash
beech
and
elm
one
hundred
to
win
on
in
the
fourth
fifty
to
win
on
in
the
third
one
hundred
to
win
on
in
the
eighth
walking
home
from
school
would
scuff
through
what
seemed
to
be
his
foliage
getting
back
into
bed
he
thought
unashamedly
of
planning
where
they
would
next
meet
and
what
they
would
do
are
he
thought
so
few
true
means
of
forgetfulness
in
this
life
that
why
should
he
shun
the
medicine
even
when
the
medicine
seemed
as
it
did
a
little
crude
was
not
as
though
she
noted
clearly
that
her
nephews
had
not
been
to
see
her
for
ten
years
not
since
their
last
journey
eastward
to
witness
their
being
lowered
into
the
rocky
soil
that
aside
from
due
notification
of
certain
major
events
in
their
lives
two
marriages
two
births
one
divorce
and
cards
of
the
traditional
sort
had
been
the
only
thin
link
she
had
with
them
through
the
widowed
years
thoughts
were
not
discrete
there
was
a
look
about
her
mouth
as
though
she
were
tasting
lemons
grasped
the
chair
arms
and
brought
her
thin
body
upright
like
a
bird
alert
for
flight
turned
and
walked
stiffly
into
the
parlor
to
the
escritoire
warped
and
cracked
now
from
fifty
years
in
an
atmosphere
of
sea
spray
she
extracted
two
limp
vellum
sheets
and
wrote
off
the
letters
one
to
one
to
her
trembling
hand
with
the
pen
grasped
tight
in
it
was
pressed
against
the
paper
the
words
came
sharply
smoothly
as
authoritatively
as
they
would
dropping
from
her
own
lips
the
stiffly
regal
look
of
them
she
saw
grimly
lacked
the
quaver
of
age
which
thwarting
the
efforts
of
her
amazing
will
ran
through
her
spoken
words
like
a
thin
ragged
string
come
down
as
soon
as
you
conveniently
can
the
upright
letters
stalked
from
the
pen
have
an
important
matter
to
discuss
with
you
am
afraid
there
is
not
much
to
amuse
small
children
here
should
be
obliged
if
you
could
make
other
arrangements
for
your
daughters
may
stay
as
long
as
you
wish
of
course
but
if
arranging
for
the
care
of
the
girls
must
take
time
into
account
think
a
day
or
two
should
be
enough
to
finish
our
business
in
give
my
regards
to
signed
the
letters
quickly
stamped
them
and
placed
them
on
the
hall
table
for
to
mail
in
town
she
went
back
to
the
wicker
chair
and
resolutely
adjusted
her
eyes
to
the
glare
on
the
water
nephews
will
be
coming
down
she
said
that
evening
as
brought
her
dinner
into
the
dining
room
the
whole
meal
on
a
vast
tray
looked
at
the
girl
speculatively
from
eyes
which
had
paled
with
the
years
from
the
early
evening
lights
of
them
which
had
first
startled
to
look
at
her
in
an
uncousinly
way
they
had
faded
to
a
of
color
which
had
possibly
from
her
constant
looking
at
the
water
something
of
the
light
of
the
sea
in
them
placed
the
tray
on
the
table
and
with
a
flick
of
dark
wrist
drew
off
the
cloth
smiled
and
the
teeth
gleamed
in
her
beautifully
modeled
olive
face
will
be
so
nice
for
you
she
said
voice
was
ripe
and
full
and
her
teeth
flashed
again
in
brilliance
before
the
warm
curved
lips
met
and
her
mouth
settled
in
repose
said
the
old
lady
and
brought
her
eyes
down
to
the
tray
remember
them
suppose
glinted
suspiciously
at
the
dish
before
her
blowfish
hope
bought
them
whole
stepped
back
her
eyes
roaming
the
tray
for
omissions
she
looked
at
the
old
woman
again
her
eyes
calm
she
said
remember
that
they
came
here
every
summer
used
to
play
with
the
older
one
sometimes
when
let
me
name
fell
with
lazy
affectionate
remembrance
from
her
lips
an
instant
the
old
aunt
felt
something
indefinable
flash
through
her
smile
would
have
said
triumph
turned
and
with
an
easy
grace
walked
toward
the
kitchen
lifted
her
head
and
followed
the
retreating
figure
her
eyes
resting
nearly
closed
on
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
rounded
hips
a
moment
she
held
her
face
to
the
empty
doorway
then
she
snorted
and
groped
for
her
fork
no
greater
catastrophe
in
the
universe
she
reflected
dourly
impaling
tender
green
beans
on
the
silver
fork
than
the
dwindling
away
of
a
family
expansion
proliferation
these
are
the
laws
of
living
things
with
the
penalty
for
not
obeying
them
the
ultimate
in
punishments
oblivion
the
fate
of
the
individual
is
visited
on
the
group
then
the
warm
sweet
butter
dripped
from
her
raised
trembling
fork
and
she
pushed
her
head
forward
belligerently
ah
then
the
true
bitterness
of
existence
could
be
tasted
indeed
the
young
garden
beans
were
brackish
in
her
mouth
was
the
last
living
of
the
older
generation
had
once
been
a
widespread
family
at
one
time
she
knew
there
were
enough
to
populate
an
entire
county
had
now
narrowed
down
to
the
two
boys
and
swung
her
eyes
up
to
the
blue
of
the
window
her
jaws
gently
mashing
the
bitter
beans
hope
lay
in
the
nephews
she
asked
the
intensifying
light
out
there
with
one
married
to
a
barren
woman
and
the
other
divorced
having
sired
two
girl
children
with
none
to
bear
on
the
name
ate
seemed
to
her
as
it
seemed
each
night
that
the
gloom
drew
itself
in
and
became
densest
at
the
empty
chairs
giving
her
the
frequent
illusion
that
she
dined
with
shadows
too
she
talked
low
quirking
her
head
at
one
or
another
of
the
places
most
often
at
armchair
which
faced
her
across
the
long
table
it
might
have
been
the
absent
nephews
she
addressed
consciously
playing
with
the
notion
that
this
was
one
of
the
summers
of
their
early
years
thought
again
of
her
children
those
two
who
had
died
young

the
later

which
might
have
saved

attach
even
a
label

their
separate
malignancies

the
cruel
clearness
of
her
memory
the
boy
remained
unchanged
quick
with
the
delight
of
laughter
and
the
pain
with
which
she
recalled
that
short
destroyed
childhood

still
unendurable

her

one
with

desolate

see

the

and
feel
his
contrition
blotted
out
in
one
shameful
moment
of
covetousness
and
were

there

his

to

the

his
fingers
curved
around
it
in

way

the

set
of

plainly

the
figure

come

of

on

that

the

the

the

primeval
memory
composed
of
equal
parts
salt
water
clams
seaweed
and
northern
air
turned
from
the
flying
trees
to
look
ahead
and
saw
with
an
inward
eye
again
the
great
fieldstone
house
which
built
on
one
of
the
many
acres
of
ancestral
land
bordering
the
west
harbor

been
to
his
as
the
last
century
ended
thoughts

have
been
keeping
silent
pace
beside
his
own
climbing
the
same
crags
in
dirty
white
sneakers
clambering
out
on
top
of
the
headland
and
coming
upon
the
sudden
glinting
water
at
the

instant
the
asked
and
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
double
lines
in
the
middle
of
the
road
the
twin
white
ribbons
which
the
car
swallowed
rapidly
as
it
ascended
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
came
down

was
the
day

in
an
unexpected
grandiose
gesture
handed
over
the
pretty
sloop
to
for
keeps
on
condition
that
he
never
fail
to
let
his
brother
accompany
him
whenever
younger
the
boy
wished
two
of
them

developed
into
a
remarkable
sailing
team
all
of
this
happening
in
a
time
of
their
lives
when
their
youth
and
their
brotherhood
knitted
them
together
as
no
other
time
or
circumstance
could
seemed
then
to
have
had
a
single
mind
and
body
a
mutuality
which
had
been
accepted
with
the
fact
of
their
youth
casually
saw
the
as
she
lay
her
slender
mast
up
and
gently
turning
its
point
describing
constant
languid
circles
against
a
cumulus
sky
of
them
had
known
the
feeling
of
the
small
life
in
her
waiting
ready
for
the
two
of
them
to
run
up
her
sails
had
been
long
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
came
unexpectedly
upon
the
sea
it
without
preparation
as
they
did
robbed
of
anticipation
a
common
disappointment
seized
them
were
climbing
the
hill
in
the
night
when
the
headlights
abruptly
probed
solid
blackness
became
two
parallel
luminous
tubes
which
broadened
out
into
a
faint
mist
of
light
and
ended
stopped
the
car
and
switched
off
the
lights
and
they
sat
looking
at
the
water
which
there
being
no
moon
out
at
first
could
be
distinguished
from
the
sky
only
by
an
absence
of
stars
eyes
were
old
and
they
never
saw
well
but
heated
with
whisky
glare
at
my
noise
growing
red
and
raising
up
his
rage
decided
hated
the
kid
too
dying
in
our
kitchen
while
was
away
where
watch
dying
just
to
entertain
and
making
me
go
up
snapping
steps
and
down
a
drafty
hall
lumped
under
the
covers
at
the
end
like
dung
covered
with
snow
snoring
and
whistling
not
care
about
the
kid
not
care
about
getting
waked
so
he
could
give
up
some
of
his
whisky
to
a
slit
of
a
kid
and
maybe
lose
one
of
his
hiding
places
in
the
bargain
would
make
him
mad
enough
if
he
was
sober
hurry
though
it
was
cold
and
the
kid
was
in
the
kitchen
was
all
shoveled
up
like
thought
be
pushed
at
his
shoulder
calling
his
name
think
his
name
stopped
the
snoring
but
he
move
except
to
roll
a
little
when
shoved
him
covers
slid
down
his
skinny
neck
so
saw
his
head
fuzzed
like
a
dandelion
gone
to
seed
but
his
face
was
turned
to
the
wall
there
was
the
pale
shadow
of
his
nose
on
the
plaster
and
thought
you
look
much
like
a
bully
now
be
sure
he
was
still
asleep
was
a
cagey
sonofabitch
shook
him
a
little
harder
and
made
some
noise
said
was
leaning
too
far
over
knew
better
always
slept
close
to
the
wall
so
you
had
to
lean
to
reach
him
he
was
smart
put
you
off
knew
better
but
was
thinking
of
the
kid
in
all
that
dough
his
arm
came
up
ducked
away
but
it
caught
me
on
the
side
of
the
neck
watering
my
eyes
and
backed
off
to
cough
was
on
his
side
looking
at
me
his
eyes
winking
the
hand
that
had
hit
me
a
fist
in
the
pillow
the
hell
out
of
here
say
anything
trying
to
get
my
throat
clear
but
watched
him
was
like
a
mean
horse
to
come
at
from
the
rear
was
better
though
hit
me
was
bitter
when
he
missed
the
hell
out
of
here
sent
me
told
me
to
wake
you
fat
hell
on
out
of
here
found
the
kid
by
the
crib
the
hell
out
pulled
at
the
covers
was
tasting
his
mouth
froze
good
is
rubbing
him
with
snow
got
him
in
the
kitchen
the
kid
kid

in
an
awful
good
humor
whenever

felt
the
memory
was
present
in
both
of
them
stirring
in
their
chests
like
a
laugh
or
a
growl
as
eager
as
an
animal
to

cursing
all

way
downstairs

the
table
where
the

the

was
ready

but
when
said

whisky
it
surprised
him
like
it
surprised
me
and
he
ran
down
never
went
near
the
old
man
when
he
was
sleeping
it
off
any
more
for
years
first
thing
every
morning
when
she
washed
her
face
she
could
see
the
scar
on
her
chin
where
cut
her
with
a
boot
cleat
and
maybe
she
saw
him
heaving
it
again
the
dirty
sock
popping
out
as
it
flew
should
have
been
nearly
as
easy
for
her
to
remember
that
as
it
was
for
to
remember
going
after
the
axe
while
he
was
still
spattered
with
yellow
sick
insides
you
said
if
needed
said
shook
his
head
but
neither
of
us
tried
to
stop
her
we
had
then
one
of
us
would
have
had
to
go
instead
rubbed
the
kid
with
more
snow
rubbed
rubbed
get
more
snow
said
took
the
pail
and
shovel
and
went
out
on
the
porch
know
where
went
thought
gone
upstairs
and
expected
to
hear
she
had
had
surprised
like
she
had
surprised
me
when
she
said
go
and
then
she
surprised
him
again
when
she
came
back
so
quick
like
she
must
have
because
when
came
in
with
the
snow
she
was
there
with
a
bottle
with
three
white
feathers
on
its
label
and
was
holding
it
angrily
by
the
throat
he
was
being
queer
and
careful
pawing
about
in
the
drawer
and
holding
the
bottle
like
a
snake
at
the
length
of
his
arm
was
awful
angry
because
thought
was
going
to
do
something
big
something
heroic
even
especially
for
her
know
him
know
him
we
felt
the
same
sometimes
while
thinking
about
that
at
all
not
anything
like
that
was
no
way
of
getting
even
like
getting
cheated
at
the
fair
were
always
trying
so
you
got
to
expect
it
had
given
something
of
his
we
both
had
when
we
thought
she
was
going
straight
to
something
valuable
but
since
she
know
given
it
to
her
there
was
no
easy
way
of
getting
it
back
cut
the
foil
off
finally
and
unscrewed
the
cap
was
put
out
too
because
there
was
only
one
way
of
understanding
what
done
had
found
one
of
hiding
places
found
one
and
she
said
a
word
while
and
had
hunted
and
hunted
as
we
always
did
all
winter
every
winter
since
the
spring
that
had
come
and
had
looked
in
the
privy
and
found
the
first
one
had
a
knack
for
hiding
knew
we
were
looking
and
he
enjoyed
it
now
found
it
by
luck
most
likely
but
she
said
anything
and
we
know
how
long
ago
been
or
how
many
other
ones
found
saying
nothing
was
sure
to
find
out
he
seem
to
because
he
hid
them
so
well
he
find
them
himself
or
because
he
looked
and
find
anything
and
figured
he
hid
one
after
all
or
had
drunk
it
up
find
out
about
this
one
because
we
were
using
it
fool
could
see
what
was
going
on
he
found
out
found
it
be
bad
took
pride
in
his
hiding
was
all
the
pride
he
had
guess
fooling
and
me
took
doing
he
figure
for
much
figure
her
at
all
and
if
he
found
out
a
woman
be
bad
poured
some
in
a
tumbler
going
to
put
more
towels
on
him
not
what
he
needs
something
warm
to
his
skin
he
where
froze
good
bad
for
frostbite
why
only
put
towels
on
his
chest
and
belly
got
to
thaw
slow
ought
to
know
that
on
the
towels
had
run
poked
her
toe
in
the
clothes
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
began
pouring
whisky
in
the
mouth
but
his
mouth
filled
without
any
getting
down
his
throat
and
in
a
second
it
was
dripping
from
his
chin
help
me
prop
him
up
got
hold
his
mouth
open
want
to
touch
him
and
hoped
would
do
it
but
she
kept
looking
at
the
clothes
piled
on
the
floor
and
the
pool
of
water
by
them
and
make
any
move
to
on
right
shove
lift
lifting
took
him
by
the
shoulders
head
flopped
back
mouth
fell
open
skin
on
his
neck
was
tight
was
cold
all
right
his
head
up
choke
mouth
is
open
shut
choke
choke
anyway
his
head
up
hold
him
like
that
your
arms
around
him
was
cold
all
right
put
my
arm
carefully
around
him
had
his
fingers
in
the
mouth
choke
for
sure
up
hold
him
like
told
you
was
cold
all
right
and
wet
had
my
arm
behind
his
back
was
in
his
at
this
time
long
past
the
establishment
of
his
name
and
the
wish
to
be
lionized
yet
once
again
and
it
was
almost
a
decade
since
he
had
sworn
off
lecturing
was
never
a
doubt
any
more
how
his
structures
would
be
received
it
was
always
the
same
unqualified
success
now
could
no
longer
build
anything
whether
a
private
residence
in
his
county
or
a
church
in
without
it
being
obvious
that
he
had
done
it
and
while
here
and
there
he
was
taken
to
task
for
again
developing
the
same
airy
technique
they
were
such
fanciful
and
sometimes
even
playful
buildings
that
the
public
felt
assured
by
its
sense
of
recognition
after
a
time
a
quality
of
authentic
uniqueness
about
them
which
once
established
by
an
artist
as
his
private
vision
is
no
longer
disputable
as
to
its
other
values
was
internationally
famous
a
crafter
of
a
genuine
in
foreign
eyes
an
original
designer
whose
inventive
childishness
with
steel
and
concrete
was
made
even
more
believably
sincere
by
his
personality
had
lived
for
almost
thirty
years
in
this
same
stone
farmhouse
with
the
same
wife
a
remarkably
childish
thing
in
itself
he
rose
at
six
every
morning
made
himself
some
coffee
had
his
corn
flakes
and
more
coffee
smoked
four
cigarettes
while
reading
last
and
then
put
on
his
shoes
and
walked
under
a
vine
bower
to
his
workshop
was
an
enormously
long
building
whose
walls
were
made
of
rocks
some
of
them
brought
home
from
every
continent
during
his
six
years
as
an
oil
geologist
debris
of
his
other
careers
was
piled
everywhere
a
pile
of
wire
cages
for
mice
from
his
time
as
a
geneticist
and
a
microscope
lying
on
its
side
on
the
window
sill
vertical
steel
columns
wired
for
support
to
the
open
ceiling
beams
with
spidery
steel
cantilevers
jutting
out
into
the
air
masonry
constructions
on
the
floor
from
the
time
he
was
inventing
his
disastrous
fireplace
whose
smoke
would
pass
through
a
whole
house
visible
all
the
way
up
through
wire
gratings
on
each
floor
files
desk
drafting
board
and
a
high
stool
formed
the
only
clean
island
in
the
chaos
else
his
ideas
lay
or
hung
in
visible
form
his
models
drawings
canvases
in
monochromes
from
his
painting
days
and
underfoot
a
windfall
of
books
that
looked
as
though
their
insides
had
been
ransacked
by
a
maniac
he
had
once
used
as
the
basis
of
the
design
for
the
plant
hung
on
a
rope
in
one
corner
and
over
his
desk
next
to
several
old
and
dusty
hats
was
a
clean
pair
of
roller
skates
which
he
occasionally
used
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
house
worked
standing
with
his
left
hand
in
his
pocket
as
though
he
were
merely
stopping
for
a
moment
sketching
with
the
surprised
stare
of
one
who
was
watching
another
hand
he
would
grunt
softly
to
some
invisible
onlooker
beside
him
sometimes
he
would
look
stern
and
moralistic
as
his
pencil
did
what
he
disapproved
all
seemed
if
one
could
have
peeked
in
at
him
through
one
of
his
windows
as
though
this
man
with
the
muscular
arms
and
neck
was
merely
the
caretaker
trying
his
hand
at
the
work
air
of
disengagement
carried
over
to
his
apparent
attitude
toward
his
things
and
people
often
mistook
it
for
boredom
in
him
or
a
surrender
to
repetitious
routine
he
was
not
bored
at
all
he
had
found
his
style
quite
early
in
his
career
and
he
thought
it
quite
wonderful
that
the
world
admired
it
and
he
could
not
imagine
why
he
should
alter
it
are
after
all
fortunate
souls
who
hear
everything
but
only
know
how
to
listen
to
what
is
good
for
them
and
was
as
things
go
a
fortunate
man
left
his
home
the
day
after
wearing
a
mackinaw
and
sheepskin
mittens
and
without
a
hat
would
wear
this
same
costume
in
despite
his
wife
reminders
over
the
past
five
days
that
he
must
take
some
cool
clothes
with
him
he
was
too
busy
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
they
parted
when
she
was
in
an
impatient
humor
he
was
bent
over
behind
the
wheel
of
the
station
wagon
feeling
in
his
trouser
cuffs
for
the
ignition
key
which
he
had
dropped
a
moment
before
she
came
out
of
the
house
with
an
enormous
shawl
over
her
head
which
she
had
bought
in
that
country
during
one
of
their
trips
abroad
and
handed
him
a
clean
handkerchief
through
the
window
the
key
under
his
shoe
he
started
the
engine
and
while
it
warmed
up
he
turned
to
her
standing
there
in
the
dripping
fog
and
said
the
refrigerator
saw
the
surprise
in
her
face
and
laughed
as
though
it
were
the
funniest
expression
he
had
ever
seen
kept
on
laughing
until
she
started
laughing
with
him
had
a
deep
voice
which
was
full
of
good
food
she
had
cooked
and
good
humor
an
explosive
laugh
which
always
carried
everything
before
it
would
settle
himself
into
his
seat
to
laugh
he
laughed
it
was
all
he
was
doing
she
was
made
to
fall
in
love
with
him
again
there
in
the
rutted
dirt
driveway
standing
in
the
cold
fog
mad
as
she
was
at
his
going
away
when
he
really
have
to
mad
at
their
both
having
got
older
in
a
life
that
seemed
to
have
taken
no
more
than
a
week
to
go
by
was
at
this
time
a
lanky
woman
of
breeding
with
an
austere
narrow
face
which
had
the
distinction
of
a
steeple
or
some
architecture
that
had
been
designed
long
ago
for
a
stubborn
sort
of
prayer
eyebrows
were
definite
and
heavy
and
formed
two
lines
moving
upward
toward
a
high
forehead
and
a
great
head
of
brown
hair
that
fell
to
her
shoulders
was
an
air
of
blindness
in
her
gray
eyes
the
look
that
ultimately
comes
to
some
women
who
are
born
at
the
end
of
an
ancestral
line
long
since
divorced
from
and
which
besides
has
kept
its
estate
intact
was
personally
sloppy
and
when
she
had
colds
would
blow
her
nose
in
the
same
handkerchief
all
day
and
keep
it
soaking
wet
dangling
from
her
waist
and
when
she
gardened
she
would
eat
dinner
with
dirt
on
her
calves
just
when
she
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
some
depravity
of
peasanthood
she
would
disappear
and
come
down
bathed
brushed
and
taking
breaths
of
air
and
even
with
her
broken
nails
her
hands
would
come
to
rest
on
a
table
or
a
leaf
with
a
thoughtless
delicacy
a
grace
of
history
so
to
speak
and
for
an
instant
one
saw
how
ferociously
proud
she
was
and
adamant
on
certain
questions
of
personal
value
even
spoke
differently
when
she
was
clean
and
she
was
clean
now
for
his
departure
and
her
voice
clear
and
rather
sharp
drive
carefully
for
sake
called
trying
to
attain
a
half
humorous
resentment
at
his
departure
he
did
not
notice
and
was
already
backing
the
car
down
to
the
road
saying
the
stump
of
a
tree
as
he
passed
it
the
same
stump
which
had
impaled
the
car
of
many
a
guest
in
the
past
thirty
years
and
which
he
refused
to
have
removed
stood
clutching
her
shawl
around
her
shoulders
until
he
had
swung
the
car
onto
the
road
when
he
had
it
pointed
down
the
hill
he
stopped
to
gaze
at
her
through
the
window
had
begun
to
turn
back
toward
the
house
but
his
look
caught
her
and
she
stood
still
waiting
there
for
what
his
expression
indicated
would
be
a
serious
word
of
farewell
looked
at
her
out
of
himself
she
thought
as
he
did
only
for
an
instant
at
a
time
the
look
which
always
surprised
her
even
now
when
his
uncombable
hair
was
yellowing
a
little
and
his
breath
came
hard
through
his
lungs
the
look
of
the
gaunt
youth
she
had
suddenly
found
herself
staring
at
in
the
on
a
once
she
kept
herself
protectively
ready
to
laugh
again
and
sure
enough
he
pointed
at
her
with
his
index
finger
and
said
more
and
roared
off
into
the
fog
his
foot
evidently
surprising
him
with
the
suddenness
with
which
it
pressed
the
accelerator
just
as
his
hand
did
when
he
worked
walked
back
to
the
house
and
entered
feeling
herself
returning
sensing
some
kind
of
opportunity
in
the
empty
building
is
a
death
in
all
partings
she
knew
and
promptly
put
it
out
of
her
mind
enjoyed
great
parties
when
she
would
sit
up
talking
and
dancing
and
drinking
all
night
but
it
always
seemed
to
her
that
being
alone
especially
alone
in
her
house
was
the
realest
part
of
life
she
could
let
out
the
three
parakeets
without
fear
they
would
be
stepped
on
or
that
would
let
them
out
one
of
the
doors
she
could
dust
the
plants
then
break
off
suddenly
and
pick
up
an
old
novel
and
read
from
the
middle
on
improvise
on
the
harp
and
finally
the
best
part
of
all
simply
sit
at
the
plank
table
in
the
kitchen
with
a
bottle
of
wine
and
the
newspapers
reading
the
ads
as
well
as
the
news
registering
nothing
on
her
mind
but
letting
her
soul
suspend
itself
above
all
wishing
and
desire
did
this
now
comfortably
aware
of
the
mist
running
down
the
windows
of
the
silence
outside
of
the
dark
afternoon
it
was
getting
to
be
fell
asleep
leaning
on
her
hand
hearing
the
house
creaking
as
though
it
were
a
living
a
private
life
of
its
own
these
two
hundred
years
hearing
the
birds
rustling
in
their
cages
and
the
occasional
whirring
of
wings
as
one
of
them
landed
on
the
table
and
walked
across
the
newspaper
to
perch
in
the
crook
of
her
arm
few
minutes
she
would
awaken
for
a
moment
to
review
things
yes
was
on
his
way
south
and
the
two
boys
were
away
in
school
and
nothing
was
burning
on
the
stove
and
was
coming
for
dinner
and
bringing
three
guests
of
hers
she
fell
asleep
again
as
soddenly
as
a
person
with
fever
and
when
she
awoke
it
was
dark
outside
and
the
clarity
was
back
in
her
eyes
stood
up
smoothing
her
hair
down
straightening
her
clothes
feeling
a
thankfulness
for
the
enveloping
darkness
outside
and
above
everything
else
for
the
absence
of
the
need
to
answer
to
respond
to
be
aware
even
of
coming
in
or
going
out
and
yet
now
that
she
was
beginning
to
cook
she
glimpsed
a
future
without
him
a
future
alone
like
this
and
the
pain
made
her
head
writhe
and
in
a
moment
she
found
it
hard
to
wait
for
to
come
with
her
guests
went
into
the
living
room
and
turned
on
three
lamps
then
back
into
the
kitchen
where
she
turned
on
the
ceiling
light
and
the
switch
that
lit
the
floods
on
the
barn
illuminating
the
driveway
knew
she
was
feeling
afraid
and
inwardly
laughed
at
herself
were
both
so
young
after
all
so
unready
for
any
final
parting
could
it
have
been
thirty
years
already
she
wondered
yes
nineteen
plus
thirty
was
and
she
was
and
she
had
been
married
at
nineteen
stood
still
over
the
leg
of
lamb
rubbing
herbs
into
it
quite
suddenly
conscious
of
a
nausea
in
her
stomach
and
a
feeling
of
wrath
a
sensation
of
violence
that
started
her
shivering
they
all
said
your
time
will
come
being
a
bride
while
you
can
was
no
room
for
company
in
the
tiny
where
the
boys
always
took
their
brides
till
they
could
get
a
house
and
a
farm
of
their
own
when
the
filled
up
and
ran
over
the
found
beds
for
everyone
in
their
own
homes
there
was
still
not
anything
that
could
do
gave
up
asking
and
accepted
her
reprieve
saying
so
she
was
really
grateful
for
to
attend
the
dying
was
something
she
had
never
experienced
and
certainly
had
not
imagined
when
she
thought
of
the
duties
she
would
have
as
wife
had
made
curtains
for
all
the
windows
of
her
little
house
and
she
had
kept
it
spotless
and
neat
shabby
as
it
was
and
cooked
good
meals
for
had
done
all
the
things
she
had
promised
herself
she
would
do
but
she
had
not
thought
of
this
died
she
would
have
said
in
hospitals
or
in
cars
on
the
highway
at
night
was
gone
all
day
now
not
coming
in
for
dinner
and
sometimes
not
for
supper
they
first
married
he
had
been
working
in
the
fields
all
day
and
she
would
get
in
the
car
and
drive
to
wherever
he
was
working
to
take
him
a
fresh
hot
meal
there
was
no
work
in
the
fields
nor
would
there
be
till
it
rained
and
she
did
not
know
where
he
went
that
she
complained
or
had
any
cause
to
or
five
of
the
cousins
from
were
about
his
age
so
naturally
they
ran
around
together
was
no
reason
for
her
to
ask
what
they
did
a
new
pattern
of
days
began
to
develop
for
did
not
die
lay
still
on
the
bed
her
head
hardly
denting
the
pillow
sometimes
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
around
and
sometimes
she
took
a
little
milk
or
soup
stopped
expecting
her
to
die
the
next
minute
but
only
in
the
next
day
or
two
who
had
driven
hundreds
of
miles
for
the
burial
would
not
go
home
for
she
might
die
any
time
but
they
might
as
well
unpack
their
suitcases
for
she
might
linger
on
the
pattern
was
established
had
put
up
her
breakfast
dishes
and
mopped
her
linoleum
rugs
she
would
go
to
the
was
not
anything
she
could
do
there
but
that
was
where
everyone
was
or
would
be
and
the
boys
would
come
by
say
sit
on
the
porch
a
while
older
men
would
be
there
at
noon
and
maybe
rest
for
a
time
before
they
took
their
guns
off
to
the
creek
or
drove
down
the
road
towards
town
women
and
children
stayed
at
the
women
keeping
their
voices
low
as
they
worked
around
the
house
or
sat
in
the
living
room
sounded
like
chickens
shut
up
in
a
coop
for
the
night
children
had
to
play
away
from
the
house
in
the
barn
loft
or
the
pasture
behind
the
barn
to
maintain
a
proper
quietness
and
on
all
day
someone
would
be
wiping
at
the
powdery
gray
dust
that
settled
over
everything
evaporative
cooler
had
been
moved
to
room
and
her
door
was
kept
shut
so
that
the
rest
of
the
house
stayed
open
though
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
it
was
hotter
or
cooler
that
way
dust
clogged
their
throats
and
the
heat
parched
them
so
that
the
women
were
always
making
ice
water
had
cleaned
up
an
old
ice
box
and
begun
to
buy
blocks
of
ice
in
town
as
the
electric
refrigerator
came
nowhere
near
providing
enough
ice
for
the
crowds
who
ate
and
drank
there
afternoon
as
the
women
sat
clucking
softly
a
new
carload
of
people
pulled
up
at
the
gate
was
a
black
grayed
with
the
dust
of
the
road
its
windows
closed
tight
so
you
knew
that
the
people
who
climbed
out
of
it
would
be
cool
and
unwrinkled
were
an
old
fat
couple
as
described
them
to
herself
a
thick
man
and
a
girl
about
ten
or
twelve
was
much
embracing
much
exclaiming
how
is
she
the
same
about
the
same
the
women
got
up
and
offered
their
chairs
and
when
they
were
all
seated
again
the
guests
made
their
inquiries
and
their
explanations
were
on
our
vacation
in
explained
in
a
muffled
voice
that
must
have
been
used
to
booming
and
the
news
catch
up
with
us
till
we
were
nearly
home
came
on
as
soon
as
we
could
was
the
suggestion
of
ice
water
and
in
spite
of
the
protest
not
really
thirsty
to
escape
the
stuffy
air
and
the
smothering
soft
voices
hurried
to
the
kitchen
filled
a
big
pitcher
and
set
it
with
glasses
on
a
tray
it
to
the
living
room
she
imagined
the
picture
she
made
tall
and
roundly
slim
a
bit
sophisticated
in
her
yellow
sheath
with
a
graceful
swingy
walk
that
she
had
learned
as
a
twirler
with
the
school
band
immediately
she
was
ashamed
of
herself
for
feeling
vain
at
such
a
time
in
such
a
place
and
she
tossed
back
her
long
yellow
hair
smiling
shyly
as
she
entered
the
room
the
thick
man
was
looking
at
her
felt
the
look
and
looked
back
because
she
could
not
help
it
seeing
that
he
was
neither
as
old
nor
as
thick
as
she
had
at
first
believed
who
is
this
asked
when
she
passed
him
a
glass
said
fondly
married
our
baby
boy
this
summer
see
said
a
right
smart
younger
than
the
rest
yes
laughed
ten
years
younger
than
expect
him
to
come
along
thought
for
the
longest
he
was
a
tumor
joke
was
not
funny
to
and
she
blushed
as
she
always
did
then
hearing
the
muffled
boom
of
laughter
blushed
redder
is
anyway
asked
that
night
makes
me
uncomfortable
a
second
cousin
or
something
got
in
the
oil
business
out
at
and
lucked
into
some
money
old
is
he
know
guess
been
married
and
got
this
kid
he
bothers
you
pay
him
any
mind
just
a
big
windbag
was
thinking
about
something
else
did
you
know
fixing
to
have
a
antelope
season
on
the
was
talking
about
antelope
again
when
they
woke
up
never
had
a
chance
to
kill
an
antelope
never
was
a
season
before
but
now
they
want
to
thin
out
on
account
of
the
drouth
he
ever
visit
here
when
he
was
a
kid
asked
know
he
was
a
kid
around
took
a
gun
from
behind
the
door
and
with
a
quick
now
was
gone
for
the
day
immediately
and
his
daughter
drove
up
in
the
going
after
ice
said
and
thought
maybe
go
along
and
keep
us
company
was
really
no
reason
to
refuse
and
had
never
ridden
in
a
along
the
road
to
town
talked
he
said
me
about
yourself
and
told
him
because
she
thought
herself
that
she
had
had
an
interesting
life
was
such
a
teenager
having
been
a
twirler
sweetheart
and
secretary
of
her
sophomore
year
she
had
started
going
steady
with
who
was
a
football
player
sweetheart
and
president
of
was
easy
to
see
that
they
were
made
for
each
other
and
they
knew
what
they
wanted
would
be
a
senior
this
year
and
he
planned
to
graduate
there
was
no
need
for
to
go
on
since
all
she
wanted
in
life
was
to
make
a
home
for
and
blushing
raise
his
children
sighed
lucky
kids
he
said
give
anything
if
could
have
found
a
girl
like
you
he
told
about
himself
course
he
say
much
really
because
of
but
could
imagine
what
kind
of
woman
his
wife
had
been
and
what
a
raw
deal
he
had
got
made
her
feel
different
about
was
going
to
tell
about
how
mistaken
she
had
been
but
he
brought
one
of
the
cousins
home
for
supper
and
all
they
did
was
talk
about
antelope
was
trying
to
get
to
say
she
would
cook
one
if
he
brought
it
home
a
whole
antelope
exclaimed
even
cook
a
piece
of
antelope
steak
never
even
saw
any
you
could
want
to
roast
the
whole
thing
and
have
it
for
the
boys
told
him
he
do
anything
like
that
with
his
dying
and
he
said
well
they
had
to
eat
they
they
all
dying
felt
like
going
off
to
the
bedroom
to
cry
but
they
were
going
up
to
the
after
supper
and
she
had
to
put
on
a
clean
dress
and
fix
her
hair
a
little
night
they
all
went
to
and
and
sat
on
the
open
front
porch
where
they
could
get
the
breeze
was
or
a
little
past
and
nearly
light
as
day
all
sat
around
and
drank
ice
water
and
the
men
smoked
and
everybody
had
a
good
time
in
a
while
they
said
what
a
shame
it
was
with
dying
but
they
all
agreed
she
have
wanted
it
any
other
way
night
the
older
men
got
to
talking
about
going
on
a
moonlight
night
and
two
or
three
of
the
other
boys
declared
they
had
never
been
and
from
side
of
the
family
said
he
would
just
get
up
from
there
and
take
them
right
then
they
had
left
some
of
the
people
moved
around
to
find
more
comfortable
places
to
sit
were
not
many
chairs
so
that
some
preferred
to
sit
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
resting
their
feet
on
the
ground
and
others
liked
to
sit
where
they
could
lean
back
against
the
wall
who
had
been
sitting
against
the
wall
said
he
needed
more
fresh
air
and
took
the
spot
on
the
edge
of
the
porch
where
had
been
sitting
be
a
darn
sight
more
comfortable
there
said
laughing
and
they
all
laughed
felt
that
she
was
not
exactly
more
comfortable
had
been
sitting
close
to
her
touching
her
actually
and
holding
her
hand
from
time
to
time
but
it
seemed
at
once
that
sat
much
closer
it
was
just
that
he
had
so
much
more
flesh
so
that
more
of
it
seemed
to
come
in
contact
with
hers
but
she
had
never
been
so
aware
of
flesh
before
she
was
not
sorry
he
sat
by
her
but
in
fact
was
flattered
had
become
the
center
of
the
company
such
stories
he
had
to
tell
had
sold
oil
stock
to
and
in
person
he
had
helped
fight
an
fire
that
raged
six
days
and
nights
tell
me
doctor
where
do
you
plan
to
conduct
the
hatching
asked
will
have
to
be
in
the
hotel
the
doctor
retorted
confirming
anticipations
want
you
to
do
is
to
go
to
the
market
with
me
early
tomorrow
morning
and
help
smuggle
the
hen
back
into
the
hotel
doctor
paid
the
bill
and
they
repaired
to
the
hotel
room
number
nine
to
initiate
further
into
these
undertakings
doctor
opened
the
smallest
of
his
cases
an
unimposing
straw
bag
and
exposed
the
contents
for
inspection
carefully
packed
in
straw
were
six
eggs
but
the
eye
of
a
poultry
psychologist
was
required
to
detect
what
scientifically
valuable
specimentalia
lay
inside
to
they
were
merely
six
not
unusual
eggs
was
little
enough
time
to
contemplate
them
however
in
an
instant
the
doctor
was
stalking
across
the
room
with
an
antique
ledger
in
his
hands
thoroughly
eared
and
big
as
a
table
top
placed
it
on
lap
is
my
hen
ledger
he
informed
him
in
an
absorbed
way
been
going
since
when
was
a
junior
in
college
first
entry
there
is
the
the
earliest
and
one
of
the
most
successful
of
my
varieties
great
big
scapulars
and
hardly
any
primaries
at
all
take
them
near
a
river
though
or
squawk
like
a
turkey
cock
the
day
before
ledger
was
full
of
most
precise
information
date
of
laying
length
of
incubation
period
number
of
chick
reaching
the
first
week
second
week
fifth
week
weight
of
hen
size
of
wattles
and
so
on
all
scrawled
out
in
a
hand
that
looked
more
than
the
most
jagged
and
sprawling
had
ever
seen
these
particulars
was
a
series
of
connected
by
arrows
and
crosses
which
denoted
the
lineage
of
the
breed
instruction
was
rapid
for
the
doctor
had
to
go
off
to
the
to
hear
more
speeches
with
only
time
for
one
sip
of
wine
to
sustain
him
through
them
all
after
the
return
that
night
could
see
from
the
high
window
in
his
own
room
the
now
familiar
figure
crouched
on
a
truly
impressive
heap
of
towels
apparently
giving
its
powers
one
final
chance
before
it
was
replaced
in
its
office
by
a
hen
knocking
at
door
roused
him
at
six
the
following
morning
was
the
doctor
dressed
and
ready
for
the
expedition
to
the
market
and
was
obliged
to
prepare
himself
in
haste
doctor
stood
about
waiting
for
to
dress
with
a
show
of
impatience
and
soon
they
were
moving
as
quietly
as
could
be
through
the
hallways
past
the
bedroom
of
the
patronne
and
so
into
the
street
market
was
not
far
and
once
there
the
sense
of
immediacy
left
him
and
he
fell
into
a
state
of
harmony
with
the
birds
around
him
stroked
the
hens
and
they
responded
with
delighted
clucks
he
gobbled
with
the
turkeys
and
they
at
once
were
all
attention
he
quacked
with
the
ducks
and
cackled
with
a
pair
of
exceedingly
flattered
geese
dawn
progressed
and
it
seemed
that
the
doctor
would
never
be
done
with
his
ministrations
when
quite
abruptly
something
broke
his
revery
was
a
fine
broody
hen
white
with
a
maternal
eye
and
a
striking
abundance
of
feathers
in
the
under
region
of
the
abdomen
doctor
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
professional
interests
have
found
scope
drew
attention
to
those
excellences
which
might
otherwise
have
escaped
him
the
fine
color
in
comb
and
wattles
the
length
and
quality
of
neck
and
saddle
hackles
the
firm
wide
spread
of
the
toes
and
a
rare
justness
in
the
formation
of
the
ear
lappets
search
was
ended
he
had
found
his
fowl
purchase
was
effected
and
they
made
their
way
towards
the
hotel
again
the
hen
with
whom
some
sort
of
communication
had
been
set
up
nestling
in
the
arms
clocks
struck
as
they
approached
the
hotel
entrance
and
hopes
that
the
chambermaid
and
patronne
would
still
be
abed
began
to
rise
in
well
exercised
breast
doctor
was
wearing
a
long
greatcoat
hardly
necessary
in
the
weather
but
a
garment
which
proved
well
adapted
to
the
sequestration
of
hens
entered
first
and
was
followed
by
the
doctor
who
for
all
his
care
manifested
a
perceptible
bulge
on
his
left
side
where
the
hen
was
cradled
advanced
in
a
line
across
the
entrance
hall
to
the
stairway
and
up
with
gingerly
steps
towards
the
first
landing
was
then
that
they
heard
the
tread
of
one
descending
and
in
some
perturbation
glancing
up
saw
the
patronne
coming
towards
them
as
they
gained
the
landing
messieurs
vous
etes
matinals
she
greeted
them
pleasantly
explained
that
they
had
been
out
for
a
stroll
before
breakfast
while
the
doctor
edged
around
behind
him
attempting
to
hide
the
protuberance
at
his
left
side
behind
arm
and
back
voulez

petits
dejeuners
tout
de
suite
alors
hostess
enquired
told
her
that
there
was
no
hurry
for
their
breakfasts
trying
at
the
same
time
to
effect
a
speedy
separation
of
the
persons
before
and
behind
him
doctor
he
noticed
was
attempting
a
transverse
movement
towards
the
stairs
but
before
the
movement
could
be
completed
a
distinct
and
audible
cluck
ruffled
the
air
in
the
hollow
of
the
swerved
in
the
head
coughed
loudly
and
the
doctor
with
a
sforzando
of
chicken
noises
floating
behind
him
took
to
the
stairs
in
leaps
the
surprised
woman
looking
at
for
an
explanation
but
he
parting
from
her
without
ceremony
only
offered
a
few
words
about
the
provincial
speech
and
a
state
of
nerves
brought
on
by
the
demands
of
his
work
that
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
followed
by
her
suspicious
gaze
entered
his
room
the
doctor
was
already
preparing
a
nest
in
the
straw
case
six
eggs
ready
for
the
attentions
was
no
reference
to
the
incident
on
the
stairs
his
powers
being
absorbed
by
this
more
immediate
business
hen
appeared
to
have
no
doubts
as
to
her
duties
and
was
quick
to
settle
down
to
the
performance
of
them
part
of
her
audience
was
totally
engaged
the
connoisseur
witnessing
a
peculiarly
fine
performance
of
some
ancient
classic
the
other
part
the
guest
of
the
connoisseur
attentive
as
one
who
must
take
an
intelligent
interest
in
that
which
he
does
not
fully
understand
spectacle
progressed
towards
a
denouement
which
was
obviously
still
remote
the
audience
attended
elapsed
but
the
doctor
was
obviously
unconscious
of
its
passage
until
an
unwelcome
knock
on
the
door
interrupted
the
processes
of
nature
he
jumped
up
to
pull
hen
and
case
out
of
view
and
went
to
the
door
opened
it
a
crack
and
in
doing
so
made
as
much
shuffling
coughing
and
scraping
noise
as
possible
in
order
to
drown
emanations
from
the
hen
who
had
begun
to
protest
was
the
fille
de
chambre
come
to
clean
the
room
and
while
she
stood
before
him
with
ears
pricked
up
and
regard
all
curiosity
explaining
her
errand
could
see
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
doctor
doing
all
he
could
to
calm
the
displeased
bird
was
reluctant
but
succeeded
in
persuading
her
to
come
back
in
five
minutes
and
the
door
was
shut
again
was
that
young
feller
doctor
instantly
asked
was
the
fille
de
chambre
the
one
you
thought
get
the
eggs
out
looked
mighty
interested
though
coming
back
in
five
minutes
to
do
the
room
mind
was
working
at
a
great
speed
he
rose
to
put
his
greatcoat
on
and
addressed
in
a
muted
voice
you
got
our
keys
handy
in
my
pocket
right
you
go
outside
and
beckon
me
when
safe
hall
was
empty
and
beckoned
they
climbed
the
stairs
which
creaked
very
loudly
to
their
sensitive
ears
and
reached
the
next
floor
guest
was
locking
his
room
they
passed
behind
him
and
got
to
room
unnoticed
doctor
sat
down
rather
wearily
caressing
the
hen
and
remarking
that
the
city
was
not
the
place
for
a
man
but
no
sooner
was
the
remark
out
than
a
knock
at
this
door
obliged
him
to
cover
the
hen
with
his
greatcoat
once
more
the
door
managed
to
persuade
the
increasingly
astonished
fille
de
chambre
to
return
in
ten
minutes
was
evident
that
a
second
transfer
had
to
be
effected
and
that
it
had
to
take
place
between
the
time
the
fille
finished
the
room
and
the
time
she
began
waited
three
minutes
and
then
crept
out
on
the
halls
were
empty
and
they
passed
down
the
stairs
to
number
nine
and
listened
at
the
door
bustle
of
sheets
being
smoothed
and
pillows
being
arranged
indicated
the
fille
de
presence
inside
they
listened
and
suddenly
a
step
towards
the
door
announced
another
important
fact
doctor
shot
down
to
the
lavatory
and
turned
the
doorknob
but
to
no
effect
the
lavatory
was
occupied
a
look
of
alarm
passed
over
his
face
he
did
not
arrest
his
movements
but
disappeared
into
the
shower
room
just
as
the
chambermaid
emerged
from
number
nine
suppressed
those
expressions
of
relief
which
offered
to
prevail
in
his
face
and
escape
from
his
throat
unwarranted
they
were
in
any
case
for
as
he
stood
facing
the
fille
de
chambre
his
ears
were
assailed
by
new
sounds
from
the
interior
of
the
shower
room
events
of
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
mysterious
to
any
bird
accustomed
only
to
the
predictable
life
of
coop
and
barnyard
had
overcome
the
hen
and
she
gave
out
a
series
of
cackly
wails
perhaps
mourning
her
nest
but
briefly
enjoyed
wits
had
not
left
him
however
for
all
his
years
and
the
wails
were
almost
immediately
lost
in
the
sound
of
water
rushing
out
from
the
showerhead
nodded
to
the
maid
as
though
nothing
unusual
were
taking
place
and
entered
the
room
the
doctor
himself
entered
his
hair
somewhat
wet
from
the
shower
but
evidently
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
their
adventures
comment
he
opened
the
closet
and
from
its
shelves
constructed
a
highboard
around
the
egg
case
which
he
had
placed
on
the
floor
inside
the
hen
was
nested
and
all
seemed
well
two
men
sat
for
some
time
savoring
the
pleasure
of
escape
from
peril
and
the
relief
such
escape
brings
before
they
got
up
and
left
the
hotel
the
doctor
to
go
to
the
conference
house
and
to
go
to
the
main
post
office
returned
to
the
hotel
rather
weary
and
with
no
new
prospects
of
a
role
in
the
late
afternoon
but
found
the
doctor
in
an
ebullient
mood
the
time
arrived
he
was
engaged
in
some
sort
of
intimate
communication
with
the
hen
who
had
settled
herself
on
the
nest
most
peacefully
after
the
occurrences
of
the
morning
have
short
memories
the
doctor
remarked
why
they
are
better
company
than
most
people
know
and
he
went
on
to
break
some
important
news
to
he
began
seems
like
some
people
in
want
to
hear
more
from
me
than
those
fellers
over
at
the
conference
house
do
got
a
big
vulture

the
zoo

of
them

only
of
their
species
outside
like
willing
but
the
male
just
flops
around
all
day
like
the
bashful
boy
who
took
behind
the
barn
and
then
know
what
to
do
and
the
people
at
the
zoo
got
any
vulture
chicks
to
show
for
their
trouble
downstairs
with
the
tray
wished
he
could
have
given
in
to
but
he
knew
better
than
to
do
what
she
said
when
she
had
that
look
were
times
it
right
to
make
a
person
happy
like
the
times
she
came
in
the
kitchen
and
asked
know

peanut
butter

peanut
butter
sandwich

this
house
he
always
told
her
cry

of
the
jar

knew
how
important
it
was
for
her
to
keep
her
figure

young
wife
was
reading

these
empty
rooms

sounded
as
though
they
already
existed
spite
of
the
hundred
things
he
had
on
his
mind
went
and
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
got
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
that
the
time
in
the
world
only
been
married
four
years
years
wailed
a
long
time
waiting
many
times
have
told
you
he
began
and
was
almost
glad
when
she
cut
him
off
many
times
and
flounced
to
the
sink
where
she
began
noisily
to
wash
her
hands
many
times
was
the
truth
of
it
thought
hardly
believed
his
reason
himself
any
more
it
had
seemed
a
good
reason
to
begin
with
no
couple
could
afford
to
have
children
you
going
to
work
with
a
child
hanging
on
you
asked
want
to
keep
this
job
you
doubted
whether
she
heard
him
over
the
running
water
sat
for
a
while
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
watching
the
bend
of
her
back
as
she
gathered
up
her
things
a
comb
a
bottle
of
aspirin
to
take
upstairs
and
pack
made
him
sad
some
days
and
he
was
never
sure
why
it
was
something
to
do
with
her
back
the
thinness
of
it
and
the
quick
jerky
way
she
bent
was
too
young
that
was
all
too
young
and
thin
and
straight
was
bellowing
out
in
the
hall
hurried
through
the
swinging
door
been
bursting
my
lungs
for
you
complained
was
standing
in
front
of
the
mirror
tightening
his
tie
had
on
his
gray
tweed
overcoat
and
his
city
hat
and
his
brief
case
lay
on
the
bench
know
what
you
think
been
doing
about
my
clothes
he
said
coat
looks
like
a
rag
heap
were
a
few
blades
of
lint
on
the
shoulder
took
the
clothesbrush
out
of
the
closet
and
went
to
work
gave
a
real
he
brushed
his
shoulders
and
his
back
and
his
collar
with
long
firm
strokes
cried
when
the
brush
tipped
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
apologized
and
quickly
set
the
hat
right
he
stood
back
to
look
at
who
was
pulling
on
his
pigskin
gloves
enjoyed
seeing
him
start
out
he
wore
his
clothes
with
style
he
was
going
to
town
nothing
was
good
enough
he
had
cursed
at
once
for
leaving
a
fleck
of
polish
on
his
shoelace
home
he
even
wash
his
hands
for
supper
and
he
wandered
around
the
yard
in
a
pair
of
sweaty
old
corduroys
velvet
smoking
jackets
wine
and
blue
which
had
bought
him
hung
brushed
and
unworn
in
the
closet
said
giving
a
final
set
to
his
hat
out
for
those
movers
watched
him
hurry
down
the
drive
to
his
car
a
handsome
man
it
made
him
proud
to
see
drove
away
went
on
looking
out
the
window
noticed
a
speck
of
dirt
on
the
sill
and
swiped
at
it
with
his
finger
he
looked
at
his
finger
at
the
wrinkled
heavy
knuckle
and
the
thick
nail
he
used
like
a
knife
to
pry
up
slit
and
open
the
first
time
he
be
sad
about
the
move
house
was
ten
years
off
his
life
let
himself
brass
handle
and
hinge
shone
for
his
reward
and
he
knew
how
to
get
at
the
dust
in
the
china
flowers
and
how
to
take
down
the
long
glass
drops
which
hung
from
the
chandelier
knew
the
house
like
a
blind
man
through
his
fingers
and
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
all
the
time
and
rags
and
polishes
he
had
spent
on
keeping
it
up
years
ago
he
had
come
to
the
house
to
be
interviewed
tulips
and
the
big
pink
peonies
had
been
blooming
along
the
drive
and
he
had
walked
up
from
the
bus
almost
singing
had
been
out
back
in
a
straw
hat
planting
flowers
had
talked
to
him
right
there
with
the
hot
sun
in
his
face
which
made
him
sweat
and
feel
ashamed
had
been
surprised
at
her
for
that
he
had
liked
the
way
she
had
looked
in
a
fresh
neat
cotton
dress
citron
yellow
if
he
remembered
had
had
a
dignity
about
her
even
barefoot
and
almost
too
tan
then
the
flowers
she
had
planted
had
spread
all
over
the
hill
the
jonquils
were
blooming
in
a
flock
by
the
front
gate
and
the
periwinkles
were
coming
on
blue
by
the
porch
steps
a
week
the
hyacinths
would
spike
out
the
dogwood
in
early
for
alfresco
party
and
after
that
the
cherries
the
yard
looked
wet
and
bald
the
trees
bare
under
their
buds
but
in
a
while
flowers
would
bloom
like
a
marching
parade
had
dug
a
hole
for
each
bulb
each
tree
wore
a
tag
with
her
writing
on
it
where
would
she
go
for
her
gardening
now
think
take
to
window
boxes
he
hurried
to
the
living
room
had
a
thousand
things
to
see
to
he
help
thinking
all
getting
old
getting
small
the
snail
is
pulling
in
her
horns
the
living
room
was
standing
by
the
window
with
a
sheaf
of
lists
in
her
hand
was
looking
out
at
the
garden
she
said
get
the
basket
for
the
breakables
had
the
big
straw
basket
ready
in
the
hall
brought
it
in
and
put
it
down
beside
her
was
looking
fine
she
had
on
her
suit
blue
with
lavender
binding
across
the
house
he
could
have
smelled
her
morning
perfume
hung
in
all
her
day
clothes
sweet
and
strong
sometimes
when
he
was
pressing
raised
her
dresses
to
his
face
studied
the
list
see
china
lemon
tree
alabaster
cockatoo
followed
her
around
the
room
collecting
the
small
frail
objects
birthday
and
anniversary
and
wrapping
them
in
tissue
paper
of
them
trusted
the
movers
they
came
to
photograph
twenty
by
twelve
inches
in
a
curly
silver
frame
said
rights
ought
to
leave
that
seeing
he
take
my
clotheshorse
smiled
at
and
he
saw
the
hateful
hard
glitter
in
her
eyes
picked
up
the
photograph
and
began
to
wrap
it
least
you
could
leave
it
for
the
movers
said
possessed
you
to
tell
me
a
clotheshorse
would
be
a
good
idea
folded
the
tissue
paper
carefully
used
it
every
day
every
morning
lay
out
his
clothes
on
it
over
now
it
was
his
main
present
that
fool

added
sharply
laid
it
in
the
basket
sets
store
by
that
was
meant
to
be
my
present
she
went
on
down
the
list
was
relieved
those
presents
had
been
on
his
mind
had
only
agreed
with
about
getting
the
valet
but
he
had
actually
suggested
the
photograph
to
know
what
she
likes
he
had
said
wearily
one
evening
in
when

off
his
overshoes

to
get
her
for

talking
about
a
picture

told
him
mean
picture
of
me

persuaded

a
disagreement

because
he
was
setting
up

in
the
next
room
the
door
he
had
seen
walking
around
waiting
for
she
had
come
down
had
heard
her
shaking
out
the
skirt
of
her
new
pink
silk
hostess
gown
do
you
like
it
had
asked
had
said
look
about
fifteen
years
old
that
a
compliment
know
had
stood
at
a
little
distance
studying
her
as
though
he
would
walk
around
next
and
look
at
the
back
of
her
head
you
make
me
feel
naked
had
giggled
and
she
went
sweeping
and
rustling
to
the
couch
and
sank
down
look
like
that
picture
have
at
the
office
had
started
a
line
not
a
wrinkle
look
like
an
old
man
compared
and
he
had
picked
up
his
photograph
with
the
red
bow
still
on
it
an
old
man

wear
pink
when
sixty
love
that
photograph
going
to
put
it
on
my
dresser
guess
children
make
a
woman
old
man
gets
old
anyhow
a
minute
he
went
on
must
think
the
curse
is
on
me
seeing
you
fresh
as
an
apple
and
me
old
and
gray
give
you
a
medical
certificate
framed
if
you
like

a
picture
with
a
few
lines
the
man

in
if
he
has
to
that
they
had
sat
for
five
minutes
without
saying
a
word
had
stood
up
rustling
and
rustling
and
gone
upstairs
it
love
had
no
doubt
that
it
was
the
rest
of
the
summer
my
scholarly
mania
for
making
plaster
casts
and
spatter
prints
of
flowers
and
leaves
was
all
but
surpassed
by
the
constantly
renewed
impressions
of
that
my
mind
served
up
to
me
for
contemplation
and
delight
in
all
the
preceding
years
had
had
the
power
to
bring
me
closer
to
a
knowledge
of
profound
sorrow
than
the
breakup
of
camp
the
packing
away
of
my
camp
uniforms
the
severing
of
ties
with
the
six
or
ten
people
had
grown
most
to
love
in
the
world
final
separation
from
them
in
the
railroad
terminal
across
the
river
from
would
nearly
cry
welcoming
arms
would
seem
woeful
inadequate
unwanted
that
year
was
different
for
just
as
the
city
in
the
form
of
my
street
clothes
had
intruded
upon
my
mountain
nights
so
an
essential
part
of
the
summer
gave
promise
of
continuing
into
the
fall
and
about
to
be
separated
not
by
a
mere
footbridge
or
messhall
kitchen
but
by
the
immense
obstacle
of
residing
in
cruelly
distant
boroughs
had
agreed
to
correspond
letters
became
the
center
of
my
existence
lived
to
see
an
envelope
of
hers
in
the
morning
mail
and
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
in
the
afternoon
to
reread
her
letter
for
the
tenth
time
and
finally
prepare
an
answer
memory
has
catalogued
for
easy
reference
and
withdrawal
the
image
of
her
pink
scented
stationery
and
the
unsloped
almost
printed
configurations
of
her
neat
studious
handwriting
with
which
she
invited
me
to
recall
our
summer
so
many
sentences
beginning
with
when
and
others
concerning
camp
friends
who
resided
in
her
suburban
neighborhood
and
news
of
her
commencing
again
her
piano
lessons
her
private
school
a
visit
to
to
see
her
grandparents
and
an
uncle
who
was
a
surgeon
returned
on
furlough
wounded
from
the
war
in
my
letters
took
on
a
personality
that
differed
from
the
self
knew
in
real
life
epistolatory
me
was
a
foreign
correspondent
dispatching
exciting
cables
and
communiques
full
of
dash
and
wit
and
glamor
quoting
from
the
books
read
imitating
the
grand
styles
of
the
authors
recommended
by
a
teacher
in
whose
special
class
was
enrolled
letters
took
their
source
from
a
stream
of
my
imagination
in
which
was
transformed
into
a
young
man
not
unlike
my
bunkmate
he
of
the
porch
steps
anecdotes
who
smoked
cigarettes
performed
the
tango
wore
fifty
dollar
suits
and
sneaked
off
into
the
dark
with
girls
to
do
unimaginable
things
with
them
in
my
fantasies
had
a
proud
bearing
and
with
a
skill
that
was
vaguely
continental
would
lead
through
an
evening
of
dancing
and
handsome
descriptions
of
my
newest
exploits
would
guide
her
gently
to
the
climax
which
in
my
dreams
was
always
represented
by
our
almost
suffocating
one
another
to
death
with
deep
moist
kisses
burning
with
love
night
after
reading
her
letter
about
her
surgeon
uncle
it
must
have
been
late
in
had
a
vision
of
myself
returned
in
ragged
uniform
from
nearly
dying
my
head
bandaged
and
blooded
and
bending
over
me
the
power
of
her
love
bringing
me
back
to
life
many
nights
afterward
the
idea
of
her
having
been
so
close
to
me
in
that
imagined
bed
would
return
and
fill
me
with
obscure
and
painful
desires
would
cause
me
to
lie
awake
in
shame
tossing
with
irresolution
longing
to
fall
into
a
deep
sleep
weeks
went
by
and
the
longer
our
separation
grew
the
more
unbounded
and
almost
unbearable
my
fantasies
became
caused
my
love
for
to
become
warmer
and
at
the
same
time
more
hopeless
as
if
my
adolescent
self
knew
that
only
torment
would
ever
bring
me
the
courage
to
ask
to
see
her
again
it
turned
out
took
matters
into
her
own
hands
received
permission
to
give
a
camp
party
she
asked
that
come
and
be
her
date
went
and
mum
and
nervous
all
but
made
a
fool
of
myself
among
those
jubilantly
reunited
bunkmates
was
shy
with
and
acted
as
had
during
those
early
mornings
when
we
all
seemed
to
be
playing
for
effect
to
be
detached
and
unconcerned
with
the
girls
who
were
properly
our
dates
but
about
whom
later
in
the
privacy
of
our
bunks
we
would
think
in
terms
of
the
most
elaborate
romance
remember
standing
in
a
corner
watching
act
the
hostess
serving
soft
drinks
to
her
guests
was
wearing
her
dark
hair
in
two
thick
braids
to
attain
an
effect
she
thought
was
appropriate
to
made
her
look
sweet
and
schoolgirlish
was
excited
to
be
with
her
but
did
not
know
how
to
express
it
a
moment
did
come
that
night
when
the
adventurous
letter
writer
and
fantasist
seemed
to
stride
off
my
flashy
pages
out
of
my
mind
and
plant
himself
in
reality
was
late
we
were
playing
kissing
games
and
and
were
called
on
to
kiss
in
front
of
the
others
blushed
and
were
flustered
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
fleetest
brush
of
lips
upon
cheek
kiss
outraged
our
friends
but
it
was
done
and
meanwhile
had
released
in
me
all
the
remote
exciting
premonitions
of
lust
all
the
mysterious
sensations
that
had
imagined
a
truly
consummated
kiss
would
convey
to
me
was
at
that
party
that
finally
overcoming
my
timidity
inspired
by
tales
only
and
overheard
among
older
boys
asked
to
spend
with
me
she
accepted
and
so
great
was
my
emotion
that
all
could
think
of
saying
was
amazing
you
know
we
agreed
to
think
of
how
we
wished
to
spend
that
night
would
write
to
one
another
and
make
a
definite
plan
was
terribly
pleased
my
school
and
neighborhood
friends
during
the
next
months
bragged
and
swaggered
and
pompously
described
my
impending
date
though
boasted
and
gave
off
a
dapper
front
was
beneath
it
all
frightened
would
be
the
first
time
had
ever
been
completely
alone
with
a
girl
loved
had
no
idea
of
what
subjects
one
discussed
when
alone
with
a
girl
or
how
one
behaved
hold
her
hand
while
walking
or
only
when
crossing
the
street
bring
along
a
corsage
or
send
one
to
her
it
preferable
to
meet
her
at
home
or
in
the
city
accompany
her
to
the
door
of
her
home
or
should
ask
to
be
invited
in
or
out
should
kiss
her
goodnight
this
was
unknown
to
me
and
yet
had
dared
to
ask
her
out
for
the
most
important
night
of
the
year
in
one
letter
informed
me
that
her
father
did
not
like
the
idea
of
her
going
out
alone
on
knew
for
a
moment
an
immense
relief
but
the
letter
went
on
she
had
cried
she
had
implored
she
had
been
miserable
at
his
refusal
and
finally
he
had
relented
and
now
how
happy
she
was
how
expectant
optimism
gave
me
heart
forced
confidence
into
myself
made
inquiries
read
a
book
of
etiquette
wrote
her
with
authority
that
we
would
meet
on
the
steps
of
the
a
rendezvous
spot
that
had
learned
was
the
most
sophisticated
would
attend
a
film
and
later
on
stated
we
might
go
to
the
or
or
for
waffles
set
the
hour
of
our
meeting
for
seven
five
that
night
it
was
already
dark
and
behind
my
closed
door
was
dressing
as
carefully
as
a
groom
wore
a
new
brown
worsted
suit
with
a
faint
herringbone
design
and
wide
lapels
like
a
ears
leather
wallet
bulky
with
twisted
raised
stitches
around
the
edges
stuffed
with
money
had
been
saving
in
an
overcoat
of
rough
blue
wool
was
given
a
proud
farewell
by
my
mother
and
father
and
set
out
into
the
strangely
still
streets
of
felt
superior
to
the
neighborhood
friends
was
leaving
behind
felt
older
than
my
years
and
was
full
of
compliments
for
myself
as
headed
into
the
subway
that
was
carrying
its
packs
of
passengers
out
of
that
dull
borough
and
into
the
unstable
tantalizing
excitement
of
when
ascended
to
it
with
my
fellow
subway
travellers
all
dressed
as
if
for
a
huge
wedding
in
a
family
of
which
we
were
all
distant
members
was
nearly
impassable
the
sidewalks
swarming
with
celebrants
with
bundled
up
sailors
and
soldiers
already
hugging
their
girls
and
their
rationed
bottles
of
whiskey
policemen
sat
astride
noble
horses
along
the
curbside
to
prevent
the
revellers
from
spilling
out
in
front
of
the
crawling
traffic
night
was
cold
but
the
crowd
kept
one
warm
giant
electric
signs
and
marquees
were
lit
up
for
the
first
time
since
blackout
regulations
had
been
instituted
and
the
atmosphere
was
alive
with
the
feeling
that
victory
was
just
around
the
corner
noisemakers
substitutes
for
the
unavailable
tin
models
were
being
hawked
and
bought
at
makeshift
stands
every
few
yards
along
and
ears
were
continually
serenaded
by
the
rasps
and
bleats
old
gentlemen
next
to
me
held
a
bugle
to
his
lips
and
blasted
away
at
every
fourth
step
and
during
the
interim
shouted
out
for
neighbors
cheered
him
on
was
a
great
sense
of
camaraderie
did
one
join
them
were
they
all
walking
to
supposed
to
buy
a
funny
hat
and
a
rattle
for
was
a
quarter
of
seven
when
the
crowd
washed
me
up
among
the
other
gallants
who
had
established
the
steps
as
the
from
which
to
launch
their
night
of
merrymaking
looked
over
their
faces
and
felt
a
twinge
they
all
looked
so
much
more
knowing
than
looked
away
looked
for
to
materialize
out
of
the
clogging
curdling
crowd
and
as
the
time
passed
and
waited
a
fiend
came
to
life
beside
me
and
whispered
in
my
ear
was
planning
to
greet
exactly
would
we
go
after
the
movie
the
lines
in
front
of
the
movie
houses
were
too
long
and
we
get
in
brought
along
enough
money
felt
for
my
wallet
thick
substantial
outline
calmed
me
when
saw
that
it
was
already
ten
past
seven
began
to
wonder
if
something
had
gone
wrong
her
father
had
changed
his
mind
and
had
refused
to
let
her
leave
at
this
very
moment
her
father
was
calling
my
house
in
an
effort
to
cancel
the
plans
grew
uneasy
about
me
there
was
a
hectic
interplay
of
meetings
taking
place
like
abrupt
jerky
scenes
in
old
silent
movies
joyous
greetings
and
beginnings
huggings
and
kissings
enthusiastic
forays
into
the
festive
night
platoons
were
taking
up
new
positions
on
the
steps
arriving
and
departing
while
stayed
glued
like
a
signpost
to
one
spot
two
hotel
doormen
came
thumping
down
the
steps
carrying
a
to
be
set
up
as
a
barricade
in
front
of
the
haberdashery
store
window
next
to
the
entranceway
and
as
watched
them
in
their
gaudy
red
coats
that
nearly
scraped
the
ground
their
golden
fringed
epaulets
and
spic
caps
suddenly
saw
just
over
their
shoulders
gracefully
making
her
way
through
the
crowd
heart
almost
stopped
beating
were
patients
on
the
bus
the
morning
left
for
most
of
them
disturbed
and
hallucinating
interne
a
nurse
and
two
attendants
were
in
charge
of
us
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
stared
out
the
bus
window
at
grim
dirty
seemed
incredible
as
listened
to
the
monotonous
drone
of
voices
and
smelled
the
fetid
odors
coming
from
the
patients
that
technically
was
a
ward
of
the
state
of
going
to
a
hospital
for
the
mentally
ill
suddenly
thought
of
the
way
her
pretty
eyes
could
flash
with
anger
her
quiet
competence
the
gentleness
and
sweetness
that
lay
just
beneath
the
surface
of
her
defenses
had
become
good
friends
during
my
stay
at
had
told
her
enough
about
myself
to
offset
somewhat
the
damaging
stories
that
had
appeared
in
local
newspapers
after
my
little
adventure
in
knew
that
lived
at
a
good
address
on
the
that
had
once
been
a
medical
student
and
was
thinking
of
returning
to
the
university
to
finish
my
medical
studies
knew
also
that
was
unmarried
and
without
a
single
known
relative
quite
sure
that
felt
enough
remorse
about
my
drinking
or
that
would
not
return
to
it
once
was
out
and
on
my
own
again
had
worried
her
read
those
newspaper
stories
about
you
she
had
said
must
have
loved
that
girl
very
much
but
you
have
meant
it
when
you
said
that
you
wanted
to
kill
her
do
you
say
that
asked
was
full
of
booze
and
well
a
drunk
is
apt
to
do
anything
he
says
do
grew
up
in
an
neighborhood
on
tell
me
about
drunks
not
the
kind
to
go
violent
you
in
love
with
that
girl
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
were
met
my
eyes
suddenly
angry
have
gone
into
nursing
if
care
about
people
interested
in
every
patient
helped
take
care
of
think
of
people
like
you
well
what
are
young
intelligent
have
a
whole
lifetime
before
you
to
make
something
worth
while
of
yourself
but
you
mess
it
up
with
whiskey
indifference
attitudes
blame
that
girl
for
breaking
her
engagement
with
you
she
pretty
yes
said
feeling
annoyed
she
was
very
pretty
believe
that
going
back
to
medical
school
and
finish
do
you
should
worked
this
ward
for
three
months
now
keep
getting
the
same
ones
back
again
and
again
all
mean
well
have
great
promises
to
make
when
they
are
about
to
go
home
but
drinking
is
their
sickness
not
seemed
like
them
but
maybe
you
are
treated
your
stay
here
like
a
big
joke
not
a
joke
to
be
sent
to
a
place
like
this
or
to
wanted
to
go
to
college
too
you
asked
has
some
of
the
best
eyes
flashed
angrily
what
mean
about
you
she
said
seem
to
know
much
about
reality
tell
you
why
go
to
college
the
oldest
of
six
children

policeman
and
makes
less
than
seven
thousand
dollars

year

no
money
for
tuition
for
clothes

all
the
things
you
apparently
take
for
granted
training
here

dollars

month

good
deal

to

two
baby
brothers
that
are
going
to

my
profession
until
an
old
maid
to
give
it
to
them
you
have
a
boy
friend
asked
none
of
your
business
she
said
then
changed
the
subject
about
your
father
and
mother
you
think
of
them
when
in
a
place
like
this
father
and
mother
died
when
was
two
years
old
said
aunt
raised
me
died
when
was
doing
my
military
service
have
no
one
but
myself
to
worry
about
in
my
voice
must
have
touched
her
deeply
because
her
anger
passed
quickly
and
she
turned
away
to
keep
me
from
seeing
her
face
sorry
she
said
know
what
do
without
my
family
always
been
so
close
me
more
about
them
eyes
became
bright
as
she
talked
about
her
father
and
mother
aunts
and
uncles
cousins
felt
cheated
and
lonely
as
only
an
orphan
can
she
had
finished
said
dad
sounds
like
a
good
father
and
a
good
policeman
bet
he
be
pleased
if
a
rumdum
like
me
were
to
ask
his
daughter
for
a
date
mean
after
out
of
the
hospital
a
month
or
so
from
now
father
is
a
sergeant
of
detectives
and
has
been
attached
to
for
five
years
a
pretty
good
judge
of
character
think
mind
too
much
if
he
were
sure
decided
not
to
be
a
rumdum
in
the
future
about
you
would
you
feel
about
it
if
were
to
ask
you
for
a
date
when
get
through
at
thought
you
were
serious
about
going
back
to
school
that
learned
something
from
your
experiences
here
and
at
well
might
consider
such
an
offer
about
your
that
girl
you
were
going
to
kill
suddenly
seemed
very
important
to
me
that
should
know
the
truth
about
me
that
was
not
the
confused
sick
irresponsible
person
she
believed
me
to
be
are
things
about
me
that
tell
you
now
said
but
if
go
out
to
dinner
with
me
when
get
out
of
like
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
can
say
this
dead
serious
about
going
back
to
school
for
that
other
girl
just
say
that
never
want
to
see
her
again
will
get
to
come
home
on
long
weekends
from
you
get
one
overnight
a
month
go
up
to
the
for
dinner
said
you
like
to
dance
always
have
a
good
orchestra
like
to
dance
she
said
then
turned
and
walked
away
been
anything
really
personal
in
her
interest
in
me
knew
that
was
just
that
she
felt
deeply
about
every
patient
on
the
ward
and
wanted
to
believe
that
they
might
benefit
from
their
treatment
there
riding
this
hospital
bus
feeling
isolated
and
utterly
alone
knew
that
she
was
genuine
and
unique
quite
unlike
any
girl
had
known
before
seemed
the
most
important
thing
in
my
life
at
this
moment
that
she
should
know
the
real
truth
about
me
was
a
fantastic
story
two
people
in
the
state
of
knew
that
was
entering
under
an
assumed
name
or
why
was
unlikely
that
any
girl
as
sharp
as
would
believe
it
without
proof
had
the
proof
all
documented
in
a
legal
agreement
which
would
show
her
the
moment
was
free
to
do
so
the
bus
turned
into
the
main
highway
and
headed
toward
settled
back
in
my
seat
and
closed
my
eyes
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
past
two
weeks
trying
to
put
the
pieces
in
order
wondered
suddenly
as
listened
to
the
disconnected
jabberings
coming
from
the
patient
behind
me
if
had
not
perhaps
imagined
it
all
this
was
reality
and
the
actor
was
delusion
a
figment
of
imagination
had
come
to
from
early
in
with
a
dramatic
production
called
was
a
bad
play
real
turkey
which
only
a
prevalence
of
angels
with
grandiose
dreams
of
capital
gain
and
tax
money
to
burn
could
have
put
into
rehearsal
one
not
even
the
producer
had
any
real
hope
of
getting
it
back
to
because
it
was
a
suspense
gangster
story
of
the
era
many
of
us
felt
that
it
might
catch
on
for
a
run
in
continue
as
a
road
company
and
eventually
become
a
movie
optimism
was
completely
unjustified
critics
literally
screamed
their
indignation
was
doomed
from
the
moment
leveled
on
it
in
his
column
opened
on
and
closed
the
following
of
the
entire
cast
alone
received
good
notices
for
my
portrayal
of
a
psychopathic
killer
let
me
in
for
a
lot
of
kidding
from
the
rest
of
the
company
two
members
of
which
were
native
were
paid
off
morning
and
given
tickets
back
to
felt
lonely
and
depressed
as
packed
my
bags
at
the
seemed
to
me
that
my
life
was
destined
to
be
one
brilliant
failure
after
another
had
been
among
the
top
third
in
my
class
at
had
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
medical
school
but
run
out
of
money
and
energy
at
the
same
time
later
had
quit
my
safe
secure
spot
on
a
network
soap
opera
to
take
a
part
in
this
play
seemed
to
me
that
was
not
only
unlucky
but
quite
stupid
as
well
knew
that
soon
be
back
working
as
an
orderly
at
the
hospital
or
as
a
counterman
at
or
while
waiting
for
another
acting
job
to
open
suddenly
occurred
to
me
that
did
not
particularly
like
acting
that
was
at
some
sort
of
crossroads
and
would
have
to
decide
soon
what
was
going
to
do
with
my
life
closed
the
last
bag
and
stood
all
three
at
the
door
for
the
bellboy
to
pick
up
then
went
to
the
bathroom
for
a
drink
of
water
telephone
rang
answered
it
a
voice
too
dignified
and
to
be
real
said

actor

for
a
while
beg
your
pardon

him

pick
you
up
at
your
hotel
at
twelve
smiled
send
the
of
course
of
course
started
to
say
something
else
appropriate
but
the
man
had
hung
up
finally
went
downstairs
to
the
bar
off
the
main
lobby
where
most
of
the
cast
were
drowning
their
sorrows
over
the
untimely
passing
of
all
bowed
low
as
approached
them
right
you

said
the
great
actor
is
about
to
buy
a
drink

motioned
to

car
told
him
showing

and
said

talking
to
about

monthly
rental
right
told
him
consulted
the
parking
ticket
then

find
it
all
right
told
him
went
back
to
the
agency
car
and
got
out

electric
bug

of
the
newest
devices

set
in
the
car
put
in
new
batteries
so
as
to

certain

plenty
of
power
and
on
my
way
out
walked
over
to
the
regular
parking
stalls
and
stood
looking
at
them
thoughtfully
waited
until
the
parking
attendant
was
busy
with
a
customer
then
slipped
around
the
back
of
the
car
with
license
number
attached
the
electronic
bug
to
the
rear
bumper
and
walked
out
attendant
waved
me
on
of
the
hardest
chores
a
detective
has
is
hanging
around
on
a
city
street
trying
to
make
himself
inconspicuous
keeping
an
eye
on
the
entrance
of
an
office
building
and
waiting
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
possible
to
be
more
or
less
interested
in
window
displays
then
in
people
passing
by
a
while
however
a
mind
gets
fed
up
and
that
magnifies
all
of
the
disagreeable
physical
symptoms
which
go
with
that
sort
of
an
assignment
want
to
sit
down
leg
muscles
and
back
muscles
feel
weary
conscious
of
the
fact
that
your
feet
hurt
that
the
city
pavements
are
hard
waited
a
solid
two
hours
before
my
man
came
out
of
the
office
building
came
out
alone
far
behind
him
when
he
entered
the
parking
lot
and
hurried
over
to
his
car
attendant
recognized
me
once
more
and
said
did
you
do
about
that
office
made
up
my
mind
yet
said
a
sublease
have
a
couple
of
them
figuring
on
one
here
and
one
out
quite
a
ways
where
usually
curb
parking
curb
parking
is
undependable
and
annoying
particularly
when
it
rains
he
said
kept
trying
to
get
him
to
take
my
money
told
him
in
a
rush
right
now
know
where
the
car
is
me
to
drive
it
out
have
one
of
the
boys
get
it
he
said
one
of
the
rules
on
transients
drive
out
their
own
cars
it
as
snappy
as
you
can
will
you
asked
all
right
he
said
going
to
be
a
regular

in
the
office
building
here

to
lease
a
place
way
out
in
the
sticks

where
it
grinned
at
him
handed
him
a
couple
of
dollars
and
said
the
time
you
get
the
parking
charge
figured
up
there
should
be
a
cigar
in
it
for
you
hurried
over
to
the
agency
heap
jumped
in
started
the
motor
and
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
car
wanted
to
shadow
turn
to
the
left
was
held
up
a
bit
trying
to
make
a
left
turn
the
time
made
it
he
was
gone
was
pretty
heavy
turned
on
the
electric
bug
and
the
signal
came
in
loud
and
clear
made
time
and
picked
him
up
within
ten
blocks
stayed
half
a
block
behind
him
letting
lots
of
cars
keep
in
between
us
listening
to
the
steady
beep
beep
beep
fifteen
minutes
of
traffic
driving
he
turned
to
the
left
see
him
but
the
electric
bugging
device
gave
steady
beeps
when
it
was
straight
ahead
short
half
beeps
when
the
car
was
following
was
to
the
left
and
long
beeps
when
it
turned
to
the
right
it
ever
got
behind
me
the
beep
turned
to
a
buzz
turned
left
too
soon
and
got
a
signal
showing
that
was
still
behind
him
but
he
was
to
the
right
a
while
the
signal
became
a
buzz
and
knew
he
was
behind
me
meant
parked
someplace
made
a
big
circle
until
located
the
car
parked
at
the
curb
in
front
of
an
apartment
house
found
a
parking
place
half
a
block
away
sat
in
the
car
and
waited
quarry
was
in
the
apartment
house
for
two
hours
he
came
out
and
started
driving
toward
the
beach
this
time
it
was
dark
could
get
up
close
to
him
where
there
was
traffic
but
had
to
drop
far
behind
when
there
traffic
lights
would
have
been
a
giveaway
if
tried
to
shadow
him
in
the
conventional
manner
have
lost
him
if
it
been
for
the
electronic
shadowing
device
signal
was
coming
loud
and
clear
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
it
turned
to
a
buzz
circled
the
block
and
found
he
was
in
the
parking
lot
of
a
restaurant
sat
where
could
watch
the
exit
and
realized
was
hungry
sat
there
with
the
faint
odor
of
steaks
tantalizing
my
nostrils
and
occasionally
catching
the
aroma
of
coffee
man
came
out
an
hour
later
drove
to
the
beach
turned
right
and
after
half
a
mile
went
to
the
and
was
a
fairly
modern
motel
with
quite
a
bit
of
electrical
display
in
front
remembered
it
was
the
place
waited
until
my
man
was
coming
out
of
the
office
with
the
key
to
a
cabin
before
went
in
to
register
card
the
man
was
shadowing
had
filled
out
was
still
on
the
counter
noticed
that
he
was
in
and
that
he
had
registered
under
the
name
of
and
wife
giving
a
address
had
written
out
the
license
number
of
his
car
but
had
transposed
the
last
two
figures
an
old
dodge
which
is
still
good
times
out
of
a
hundred
the
motel
manager
check
the
license
number
on
the
plates
against
the
license
number
the
tenant
writes
out
he
does
still
better
than
an
even
chance
he
notice
the
transposition
of
the
numbers
and
if
he
should
notice
it
the
thing
can
be
passed
off
as
an
honest
mistake
used
the
alias
of
gave
the
first
three
letters
and
the
first
and
last
figure
of
the
license
number
on
the
agency
heap
but
a
couple
of
phony
numbers
in
between
could
have
written
anything
manager
of
the
motel
was
a
woman
who
apparently
care
was
complying
with
the
law
in
regard
to
registrations
but
she
certainly
checking
license
numbers
or
bothering
the
tenants
mean
all
alone
right
wife
going
to
join
you
later
think
so
you
expect
her
to
show
up
she
said
better
put
and
wife
on
there
a
formality
you
know
difference
in
the
rate
asked
to
you
she
said
smiling
ten
dollars
either
way
are
ice
cubes
in
a
container
at
the
far
end
and
in
another
by
the
office
are
three
vending
machines
and
if
you
should
be
joined
by
anybody
try
to
keep
things
quiet
if
you
will
like
to
run
a
nice
quiet
place
you
told
her
took
another
sidelong
glance
at
the
other
registration
card
then
took
the
key
to
that
she
had
given
me
and
went
down
long
enough
to
park
the
car
construction
was
reasonably
solid
not
like
the
construction
of
so
many
of
the
motel
units
that
have
stucco
all
over
the
outside
but
walls
that
are
thin
enough
so
you
can
hear
every
movement
of
the
people
in
the
adjoining
apartment
put
a
small
electric
amplifier
against
the
wall
on
the
side
wanted
to
case
the
aid
of
that
could
hear
my
man
moving
around
heard
him
cough
a
couple
of
times
heard
the
toilet
flush
heard
the
sound
of
water
running
his
companion
was
going
to
be
she
was
going
to
join
him
later
knew
where
to
come
have
to
telephone
was
so
hungry
my
stomach
felt
all
lines
of
communication
had
been
severed
one
thing
to
go
without
food
when
occupied
with
some
work
or
when
simply
postponing
a
meal
but
when
dependent
on
someone
else
and
know
that
you
eat
until
bedded
down
for
the
night
hunger
can
be
a
gnawing
torture
had
noticed
a
down
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
batteries
on
the
bugging
device
had
put
on
the
car
were
still
fresh
enough
to
send
out
good
strong
signals
powerful
microphone
could
press
against
the
wall
between
my
motel
unit
and
that
occupied
by
the
man
would
bring
in
the
sound
of
any
conversation
and
was
positively
nauseated
was
so
hungry
got
in
the
car
drove
down
to
the
and
ordered
a
couple
of
hamburgers
with
everything
included
a
cup
of
coffee
and
the
fastest
service
possible
place
particularly
busy
at
that
time
of
night
and
the
girl
who
was
waiting
on
me
who
was
clothed
in
the
pair
of
slacks
had
ever
seen
on
a
woman
and
a
sweater
that
showed
everything
there
was
and
there
was
lots
of
it
wanted
to
be
sociable
really
in
a
hurry
asked
in
a
hurry
early
in
the
evening
to
be
in
a
hurry
lots
of
time
left
may
not
be
any
women
left
said
gave
a
little
pout
and
said
get
off
work
until
eleven
when
my
evening
commences
be
here
at
said
you
announced
what
they
all
say
that
thing
going
in
your
car
said
it
the
automatic
signal
that
shows
when
the
ignition
key
is
on
turn
it
off
reached
over
and
switched
off
the
electronic
bugging
device
went
in
to
get
the
hamburgers
and
switched
on
the
device
again
and
kept
the
signal
from
car
coming
in
steady
and
clear
until
saw
her
starting
back
with
the
hamburgers
shut
off
the
device
again
wanted
to
hang
around
while
was
eating
you
think
selfish
to
have
dinner
before
you
go
to
pick
her
up
said
a
kindness
to
her
see
on
a
diet
eat
just
a
pineapple
and
cottage
cheese
salad
and
to
have
one
with
her
so
she
feel
out
of
place
can
be
terrible
the
girl
said
much
overweight
is
she
a
bit
said
but
keeping
her
figure
in
hand
looked
at
me
provocatively
figures
should
be
kept
in
hand
she
said
and
walked
away
with
an
exaggerated
wiggle
turned
on
the
device
again
half
fearful
that
might
find
silence
but
the
buzzes
came
in
loud
and
clear
switched
on
the
lights
for
her
to
come
and
get
the
check
had
the
exact
change
plus
a
dollar
tip
fat
man
said

gotta
do
is
go
around
the
corner
gun
moved
thin
man
said
second
building
on
the
right

says

the
door
so
even
if
we
was
as
dumb
as
you
take
us
for
we
could
still
find
it
and
began
to
back
toward
the
door
thin
man
waved
the
gun
again
said
around
the
corner
says

the
door
paused
to
feel
for
the
latch
glanced
up
at
her
husband
was
going
to
be
sensible
and
not
try
to
do
anything
rash
with
that
gun
pointed
at
him
measured
the
distance
from
where
they
stood
to
the
men
and
the
gun
measured
the
distance
from
the
men
to
the
back
room
decided
to
risk
it
was
something
phony
about
all
this
gun
waving
something
not
quite
what
it
seemed
in
the
detailed
directions
for
finding
the
police
had
the
latch
under
his
thumb
now
and
he
removed
his
arm
from
his
wife
in
order
to
pull
the
door
open
a
flash
she
was
away
to
the
back
paying
no
attention
to
three
angry
shouts
from
the
male
throats
tore
open
the
back
door
was
dark
inside
the
room
but
enough
light
spilled
from
the
restaurant
behind
her
to
enable
her
to
make
out
a
round
table
with
a
green
cloth
top
was
a
small
sideboard
with
some
empty
beer
bottles
on
it
and
perhaps
fifteen
wooden
chairs
she
turned
to
face
the
men
again
at
the
counter
was
on
his
feet
distance
between
where
she
stood
and
where
waited
at
the
outside
door
was
a
hundred
miles
her
frightened
gaze
on
the
men
at
the
counter
she
began
to
feel
her
way
to
the
door
sidled
along
the
booths
one
step
at
a
time
gun
followed
her
she
reached
and
felt
his
arm
go
around
her
felt
him
pull
her
to
the
safety
of
his
person
she
knew
with
the
certainty
of
despair
that
something
bad
had
happened
to
two
men
watched
as
closed
the
door
behind
them
watched
them
cross
the
sidewalk
to
their
car

on
a
greasy
and
wrinkled
jacket

swiftly
to
the

and
dialed
a
number

against
the
blanket

little
because

two
men
had
been
startled
to
find
a
strange
girl
in
the
back
seat
of
their
car
she
had
figured
that
out
but
she
understand
their
subsequent
actions

because

had
shown
panic

blame
her
for
that

another
to

in
a
strange
garage
and
know
your
parents
had
gone
on
home
without
you
was
glad
the
fat
man
had
left
was
not
really
frightening
jumped
as
the
little
man
now
appeared
at
the
window
and
reaching
through
the
opening
offered
her
a
bottle
of
coke
smiled
at
him
wetly
she
found
she
was
thirsty
she
was
about
to
refuse
never
never
take
candy
from
a
strange
man
when
she
saw
the
bottle
was
unopened
placed
a
bottle
opener
on
the
counter
he
understood
her
panic
blew
her
nose
on
a
tissue
and
opened
the
coke
bottle
was
icy
cold
and
tasted
delicious
felt
a
lift
in
spirit
she
was
finished
she
pushed
it
back
man
was
busy
doing
something
to
the
inside
of
the
on
the
side
of
a
car
called
softly
looked
in
her
direction
but
he
answer
said
why
is
he
keeping
me
here
no
answer
seemed
to
be
looking
at
a
point
above
the
little
window
said

my
home

some
money
from
someone
and
go
home
by
bus

the
cigarette
he
had

and
carefully
ground
it
to
nothing
with
the
sole
of
his
heavy
shoe
he
looked
at
her
said
only

here
said
he
was
back
at
work
on
a
car
dropped
her
head
on
her
arms
on
the
counter
could
he
be
kind
one
moment
and
cruel
the
next
he
know
something
that
made
him
feel
sad
and
sorry
for
her
was
he
afraid
to
do
anything
as
definite
as
releasing
her
heart
was
thumping
painfully
the
unknown
was
so
much
worse
than
what
dangers
lay
ahead
for
her
awful
thing
had
she
to
face
in
the
next
few
hours
wet
and
hot
was
trickling
on
her
wrists
a
sturdy
act
of
will
she
turned
her
mind
away
from
herself
as
long
as
she
could
do
nothing
constructive
about
the
situation
she
was
in
she
would
think
about
something
else
mother
and
father
for
instance
were
they
now
her
mind
she
followed
the
white
along
the
road
somewhere
between
here
and
the
attention
would
be
on
the
road
ahead
and
it
deviate
an
inch
until
he
crossed
the
bridge
at
the
and
took
the
to
and
finally
turned
in
at
their
own
driveway
at
he
would
yawn
and
stretch
and
shout
out
is
the
end
of
the
line
what
would
her
mother
be
doing
right
now
mother
would
be
fast
asleep
curled
up
against
that
wonderful
big
safe
solid
shoulder
next
to
her
on
the
front
seat
was
in
trouble
and
she
was
alone
put
her
hand
on
her
arm
as
he
slid
in
the
seat
beside
her
birds
were
sweetly
calling
were
answered
teeth
chattered
so
that
she
made
three
attempts
at
speech
before
she
became
intelligible
saw
that
apron
behind
the
door
was
a
wet
spot
she
have
been
gone
long
made
some
sound
meant
to
convey
agreement
inserted

while

corner
big
car
sprang
away
from
the
curb
like
something
alive
said
not
going
to
leave
my
wife
and
my
car
out
here
in
sight
of
those
glanced
at
him
and
stopped
trembling
jowls
were
spiked
by
barbs
of
graying
beard
small
mean
eyes
regarded
steadily
unblinkingly
eyes
were
threaded
by
little
filaments
of
red
as
if
tiny
veins
had
burst
and
flooded
blood
into
them
he
chewed
his
gum
and
exuded
wheezing
breath
smelt
the
reek
of
bad
whiskey
recognized
the
man
had
driven
the
car
that
passed
them
on
the
road
outside
place
was
proprietor
of
the
juke
joint
smiled
at
pleasantly
and
said

a
cab
waiting
for
me
here

know
where
it
might
have
gone
chewed
his
gum
his
jaw
moving
in
a
steady
rhythm
looked
straight
at
did
not
answer
scanned
the
faces
of
the
others
nearest
him
looked
into
their
staring
eyes
anyone
see
my
cab
asked
keeping
his
voice
casual
avoided
showing
any
surprise
or
annoyance
when
no
one
answered
him
have
to
get
back
to
he
went
on

there
are
some
cars

wonder
if
one
of
you
gentlemen
could
drive
me
back
to
town
be
happy
to
pay
for
the
favor
of
course
seventeen
men
stood
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
longer
then
a
startling
thing
occurred
was
so
utterly
unexpected
that
stood
for
several
moments
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
foolishly
after
it
had
happened
was
no
word
spoken
no
apparent
signal
given
the
men
all
moved
at
the
same
instant
piled
into
the
waiting
cars
motors
roared
the
cars
sped
off
station
wagon
and
the
old
headed
east
toward
and
the
pickup
truck
sped
west
toward
seconds
all
four
cars
were
out
of
sight
stood
alone
on
a
road
as
storm
clouds
gathered
ominously
in
the
sky
again
a
great
distance
thunder
growled
and
broke
the
silence
looked
back
toward
the
dilapidated
house
thought
he
saw
a
pale
face
at
a
window
it
was
she
would
be
glad
that
they
hurt
him
were
other
farmhouses
nearby
the
road
there
was
one
no
more
than
a
hundred
yards
away
was
another
on
this
side
a
little
further
down
were
many
more
between
here
and
poles
lined
the
road
reared
tall
and
mocking
wires
stretched
out
into
infinity
a
single
strand
of
wire
reached
into
the
silent
houses
beside
the
road
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
walk
was
more
than
three
miles
away
down
an
old
dirt
road
that
the
rain
had
turned
into
a
quagmire
faced
east
and
started
walking
down
the
left
side
of
the
road
he
had
proceeded
a
few
feet
he
paused
and
turned
up
the
cuffs
of
his
trousers
which
were
already
damp
and
viscous
mud
was
and
in
places
great
puddles
spread
across
the
road
and
reflected
the
murky
light
he
approached
the
first
farmhouse
thunder
sounded
behind
him
again
closer
now
and
louder
like
a
steadily
advancing
drum
corps
were
several
people
on
the
porch
of
the
farmhouse
was
a
very
old
man
and
a
young
woman
and
a
brood
of
children
ranging
from
toddlers
to
just
an
instant
he
thought
of
appealing
to
them
for
help
they
had
a
car
or
truck
and
would
drive
him
into
town
he
realized
the
utter
futility
of
the
idea
were
staring
at
him
in
the
same
blank
and
menacing
way
that
the
men
outside
the
gate
had
stared
the
eyes
of
the
smallest
children
seemed
malicious
his
side
of
the
road
there
were
two
farm
hands
well
back
in
a
field
leaning
against
a
plow
too
stared
at
him
drums
of
thunder
were
right
behind
him
now
foolish
thought
came
into
his
head
remembered
a
story
he
had
read
as
a
youth
was
probably
one
of
tales
of
the
concerned
an
officer
who
had
been
disgraced
and
drummed
out
steady
roll
of
the
drums
had
sounded
behind
him
as
he
walked
between
the
endless
ranks
of
the
men
he
had
commanded
and
each
man
and
turned
his
back
as
the
officer
approached
wished
these
poor
farm
people
would
turn
their
backs
fencing
by
the
roadside
ended
the
dirt
highway
was
bordered
on
either
side
by
a
fairly
deep
drainage
ditch
too
broad
to
leap
over
unless
you
were
an
star
rain
had
been
added
to
the
stagnant
water
was
trapped
on
the
road
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
an
approaching
car
was
coming
toward
him
car
was
now
in
sight
heart
skipped
a
beat
when
he
recognized
it
was
the
station
wagon
that
had
passed
his
cab
on
the
road
the
station
wagon
that
had
been
parked
at
the
farm
station
wagon
had
headed
back
toward
had
only
been
a
ruse
to
lure
him
out
on
the
deserted
road
and
his
friends
were
returning
to
seek
him
out
station
wagon
came
to
a
stop
a
couple
of
hundred
feet
in
front
of
him
beside
a
fenced
field
there
was
another
sound
second
car
was
coming
from
the
west
from
the
direction
of
was
the
that
had
been
outside
farm
looked
helplessly
in
both
directions
was
a
narrow
road
barely
wide
enough
for
two
cars
to
pass
could
not
leave
the
road
because
of
the
drainage
ditch
the
two
cars
were
equidistant
from
him
the
station
wagon
started
up
again
and
the
gathered
speed
bore
down
on
him
was
nothing
he
could
do
except
jump
into
the
ditch
jumped
and
sank
to
his
knees
in
muddy
water
the
two
cars
roared
by
there
was
a
eerie
sound
knew
how
the
soldiers
must
have
felt
at
and
and
when
the
ragged
gray
ranks
charged
at
them
screaming
the
wild
banshee
howl
they
called
the
yell
moments
he
stood
in
water
shivering
and
gasping
for
breath
had
turned
his
ankle
slightly
and
it
pained
him
cars
with
their
load
of
howling
men
had
disappeared
in
the
distance
had
been
two
more
cars
parked
at
the
farm
a
and
a
pickup
truck
would
be
coming
for
him
next
bearing
down
on
him
from
both
directions
then
the
station
wagon
and
the
would
seek
him
out
again
would
be
harassed
repeatedly
and
would
escape
death
by
inches
time
after
time
all
the
way
to
still
had
three
miles
to
go
the
more
affluent
juvenile
delinquents
who
could
afford
autos
instead
of
switch
blades
as
lethal
weapons
played
this
same
game
and
called
it
could
not
go
through
the
fields
way
was
barred
on
both
sides
of
the
road
by
a
high
fence
had
to
make
for
the
section
of
road
just
ahead
that
was
bordered
by
the
rail
fence
the
section
by
the
farmhouse
least
he
could
climb
up
on
the
fence
when
his
tormenters
roared
by
again
place
could
not
be
far
now
would
go
in
there
climb
through
the
window
and
at
least
be
safe
for
a
little
while
and
able
to
rest
was
even
a
bare
chance
that
the
phone
had
not
been
disconnected
did
not
dare
climb
back
up
to
the
road
was
deep
in
water
but
at
least
they
could
not
reach
him
there
splashed
on
mud
sucking
at
his
feet
with
each
step
until
he
reached
the
end
of
the
drainage
ditch
and
the
beginning
of
the
fence
that
enclosed
the
farm
climbed
back
to
the
road
and
he
felt
utterly
exhausted
stood
panting
for
a
moment
then
he
saw
something
that
he
had
not
seen
before
and
panic
gripped
him
again
fence
his
only
refuge
when
the
metal
death
came
roaring
at
him
was
made
of
rails
all
right
but
the
rails
were
protected
by
a
thick
screening
of
barbed
wire
that
would
rip
his
flesh
if
he
pressed
against
it
lurched
on
down
the
road
despairingly
because
there
was
no
place
else
to
go
lost
all
sense
of
dignity
could
not
stand
on
dignity
when
you
were
soaked
and
muddied
and
your
life
was
at
stake
people
were
watching
him
from
the
porch
or
from
behind
the
windows
of
this
farmhouse
too
but
he
did
not
bother
to
look
broke
into
a
dogtrot
breathing
heavily
streaming
with
sweat
had
to
reach
place
was
his
only
sanctuary
fences
on
both
sides
of
the
road
bristled
with
the
barbed
wire
fences
stretched
on
endlessly
then
he
heard
them
now
he
saw
them
was
coming
at
him
from
the
east
the
pickup
truck
from
the
west
had
timed
it
better
this
time
would
reach
him
at
almost
exactly
the
same
instant
stopped
he
backed
against
the
fence
one
of
the
cars
would
brush
him
as
it
passed
and
he
would
be
cruelly
lacerated
by
the
wire
stumbled
to
the
middle
of
the
road
and
simply
stood
there
waiting
for
them
a
perfect
target
cars
must
have
had
their
gas
pedals
pushed
down
to
the
floor
boards
were
coming
on
at
reckless
speed
for
such
old
vehicles
thundered
at
him
held
his
arms
close
to
his
sides
and
made
himself
as
small
as
possible
the
neared
it
veered
toward
him
and
seemed
about
to
run
him
down
forced
himself
to
stay
frozen
there
he
moved
he
would
be
in
the
path
of
the
other
car
thought
the
fender
of
the
brushed
his
jacket
as
it
went
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
the
pickup
truck
hurtled
by
on
the
other
side
weird
insane
sound
of
the
yell
reverberated
again
and
echoed
from
the
distant
hills
did
not
leave
the
middle
of
the
road
did
not
try
to
run
trudged
on
his
aching
eyes
focused
straight
ahead
was
nearing
the
house
was
going
to
make
it
he
told
himself
then
he
heard
a
car
coming
from
the
east
and
he
felt
as
if
he
would
break
down
and
weep
no
not
again
he
said
aloud
again
so
soon
was
a
new
sound
a
sound
as
piercing
as
the
yell
yet
different
was
the
sound
of
a
siren
he
saw
that
the
approaching
car
was
painted
white
and
he
began
to
wave
his
arms
frantically
was
the
prowl
car
from
the
office
car

up
alongside
him
and
stopped
in

occupied
with
maneuvering
the
car
around

a
very
narrow
space
it
was
finally
pointed
east

said

into

bedroom

slippers

dry
socks
and
shoes

talking
on
the
phone
when
he
came

hour

moment
and
then

said

the
on
within
an
hour

satisfaction

the
appointment

hung

briskly

before

out
in
the
section
you

my
car

parked
in
front
hastily
slopped
whiskey

because

on
over
to
the
can

up
went
to
a
closet
to
get
a
light
jacket
and
took
his
hat
from
beside
the
door
gulped
down
the
whiskey
hastily
and
joined
him
asking
are
we
going
to
call
on
in
the
section
lady
is
maybe
not
too
much
of
a
lady
least
want
to
find
out
whether
home
yet
or
not
opened
the
door
and
followed
out
car
drove
east
to
and
north
toward
address
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
governess
he
drove
he
filled
in
briefly
on
the
events
of
the
evening
after
leaving
the
reporter
to
go
to
the
house
and
on
his
own
surmises
want
to
be
in
at
midnight
when
makes
her
phone
call
there
he
ended
grimly
know
whether
that
threatening
letter
of
hers
has
anything
to
do
with
this
situation
or
not
but
want
to
see
who
takes
the
call
deal
at
where
the
two
jumped
you
said
with
interest
that
sounds
like
it
was
set
up
with
malice
aforethought
by
the
luscious
it
does
grunted
sourly
still
able
to
taste
her
mouth
on
his
in
the
parking
lot
story
of
hers
about
an
unsigned
note
directing
her
to
be
there
tonight
sounds
completely
phony
it
was
designed
to
put
me
on
the
spot
it
would
have
to
have
been
written
before
ever
called
me
in
on
the
case
you
think
did
have
the
counterfeit
bracelet
made
without
her
knowledge
the
faintest
idea
think
her
husband
strongly
suspects
so
and
why
he
called
me
in
on
the
thing
in
direct
defiance
of
his
confederates
and
almost
certainly
without
telling
them
why
he
was
doing
so
this
street
asked
peering
ahead
at
the
partially
obscured
street
sign
could
see
it
better
out
the
side
and
he
said
yes
to
the
left
think
for
that
number
you
gave
me
more
than
a
block
or
so
got
in
the
lane
and
cut
across
the
divider
was
a
small
restaurant
and
cocktail
lounge
on
the
southeast
corner
of
the
intersection
as
he
turned
into
the
quiet
street
where
most
of
the
houses
on
both
sides
were
older
mansions
now
cut
up
into
furnished
rooms
and
housekeeping
apartments
drove
westward
from
the
slowly
letting
crane
his
head
out
the
window
and
watch
for
street
numbers
single
automobile
was
parked
up
the
block
on
the
side
noted
idly
that
it
carried
license
plates
as
he
approached
and
then
saw
the
flare
of
a
match
in
the
front
seat
as
they
passed
indicating
that
it
was
occupied
turned
to
see
the
faces
of
two
men
in
the
parked
car
just
as
said
the
next
house
the
right
of
pulling
into
the
curb
increased
his
speed
slightly
to
the
corner
where
he
swung
left

around
the
corner
and
parked
turning
off
his
lights
and
motor

an
aggrieved

quick
look

you

minute

to
the
cocktail
lounge

under
the
wheel

me
into

do
they
add
up
to
headlines

complain
crossed
the
street
and
walked
swiftly
southward
to
circle
back
to
the
and
north
a
block
to
the
open
restaurant
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
bar
enjoying
a
slug
of
cognac
when
came
in
six
or
eight
minutes
later
reporter
nodded
as
he
moved
up
beside
him
at
the
bar
told
the
bartender
and
water
and
told
him

two
all
right
and
made
them

be
persuaded
not
to

minutes

that
a
couple
of
drunks
are
having
a
hell
of
a
fight
down
the
street
and
they
better
send
a
patrol
car
hang
up
fast
and
come
walking
on
down
to
the
address
be
waiting
for
you
there
bartender
brought
drink
and
laid
a
bill
on
the
bar
said
in
a
low
voice
got
a
date
with
a
lady
that
pay
for
a
pint
can
take
with
me
know
how
it
is
he
added
with
a
conspiratorial
wink
is
dandy
but
liquor
is
quicker
and
you
have
any
candy
for
sale
here
anyhow
sure
bartender
winked
back
at
him
and
palmed
the
bill
turned
away
and
returned
in
a
moment
with
a
pint
of
brandy
in
a
small
paper
sack
which
he
slid
over
the
counter
to
the
detective
slid
it
into
his
pocket
asked
sadly
in
hell
are
you
going
to
do
a
couple
of
punk
detectives
named
and
wish
to
stayed
out
of
my
way
this
afternoon
minutes
strode
out
blithely
and
checked
his
watch
and
sipped
his
drink
getting
a
dime
ready
to
make
the
telephone
call
to
the
police
hesitated
when
he
saw
that
had
parked
his
coupe
directly
in
front
of
the
bar
headed
south
walked
over
to
the
door
opened
it
and
got
the
reloaded
automatic
out
of
the
glove
compartment
and
put
it
in
his
hip
pocket
hoped
he
be
forced
to
use
it
in
taking
care
of
the
detectives
but
its
weight
was
comforting
at
his
hip
this
side
of
the
cops
had
no
more
legal
rights
than
any
ordinary
citizen
and
pistol
permit
was
just
as
good
as
theirs
went
swiftly
up
the
sidewalk
toward
the
parked
car
with
the
two
detectives
in
the
front
seat
tugged
the
brim
of
his
hat
low
as
he
approached
stepped
out
into
the
street
just
behind
the
car
and
strode
around
to
the
side
big
paunchy
man
named
was
on
that
side
in
the
seat
toward
his
companion
so
that
his
back
partially
rested
against
the
closed
door
turned
the
handle
and
jerked
the
door
open
before
either
of
the
men
were
quite
aware
of
his
presence
in
the
night
grunted
and
slid
partly
out
and
left
arm
snaked
in
around
his
neck
to
help
him
while
he
set
himself
solidly
on
the
roadway
and
swung
his
right
fist
to
the
big
jaw
before
could
straighten
up
stepped
back
to
let
him
slump
to
the
ground
and
then
dived
over
him
through
the
open
door
into
who
was
cursing
loudly
and
trying
to
drag
a
gun
from
a
shoulder
holster
somewhat
impeded
by
the
steering
wheel
locked
his
big
hands
around
thin
neck
and
dragged
him
out
over
the
seat
into
the
roadway
hit
him
once
on
the
sharp
point
of
his
chin
and
felt
the
body
go
limp
dropped
him
into
the
street
a
couple
of
feet
away
from
recumbent
figure
and
stared
down
at
both
of
them
for
a
moment
before
kicking
the
big
man
lightly
in
the
side
stir
were
both
breathing
heavily
out
cold
and
think
either
of
them
had
recognized
him
or
could
describe
him
got
the
pint
of
liquor
out
of
his
pocket
and
unscrewed
the
top
sprinkled
the
pungent
stuff
liberally
over
both
men
and
then
tossed
the
open
bottle
in
on
the
front
seat
turned
then
to
look
toward
the
lighted
and
saw
tall
emaciated
figure
come
out
of
the
lounge
and
hurriedly
start
to
angle
across
the
street
toward
the
opposite
side
strolled
across
to
intercept
the
reporter
in
front
of
the
house
where
lived
and
asked
casually
the
police
okay
have
a
patrol
car
here
fast
get
inside
happened
with
you
the
two
damned
fools
got
all
excited
when
they
saw
the
bottle
and
knocked
each
other
out
cold
said
have
fun
explaining
that
to
the
cops
no
business
over
here
on
a
anyway
went
up
onto
a
front
porch
and
into
a
small
hallway
where
a
dim
bulb
burned
high
in
the
ceiling
row
of
mailboxes
along
the
wall
had
numbers
and
names
on
them
found
one
marked
stairway
on
the
right
was
dark
but
there
was
a
at
the
bottom
which
lighted
another
dim
bulb
at
the
top
and
they
went
up
were
two
front
rooms
both
dark
behind
their
transoms
and
there
was
no
sound
or
light
in
the
entire
house
to
indicate
that
any
of
the
occupants
were
awake
nine
steps
above
him
had
paused
paused
with
him
waiting
no
longer
impatient
trying
now
to
think
it
out
do
a
little
planning
looked
down
over
the
banister
at
the
hotel
desk
with
the
telephone
and
pen
set
could
call
in
they
could
check
the
story
while
we
were
on
our
way
have
to
tell
them
had
he
heard
it
like
a
muffled
thud
felt
a
subtle
change
in
air
pressure
glanced
up
in
time
to
see
hurtling
down
on
him
from
above
literally
flying
through
the
air
his
bloody
face
twisted
tried
to
flatten
against
the
banister
gripped
it
with
one
hand
but
full
weight
struck
him
at
that
moment
in
the
groin
gasped
for
air
and
the
impact
tore
his
hand
from
the
rail
tumbled
with
helpless
and
in
agony
over
and
over
down
the
steps
a
wrenching
effort
he
managed
to
hunch
and
draw
in
to
take
the
final
fall
on
his
back
and
shoulders
rather
than
his
head
was
fuzzy
in
his
mind
and
for
a
moment
helpless
on
the
lobby
floor
but
he
was
conscious
and
free
of
the
weight
of
body
his
vision
cleared
he
saw
the
taller
one
scrambling
upward
reaching
was
on
his
knees
when
turned
on
the
stairs
and
the
razor
flashed
in
his
hand
felt
his
empty
pocket
and
knew
that
had
retrieved
the
only
weapon
at
hand
eyes
fixed
on
the

which
would
first
betray
the
moment
and
direction
of
an
attack
rose
stiffly
forcing
his
knees
to
lock
knifelike
pain
in
his
groin
nearly
brought
him
down
again
made
himself
back
off
slowly
his
eyes
wary
on
who
now
had
no
more
to
lose
than
he
pain
dulled
as
he
moved
and
he
steadied
inside
a
moment
he
extended
one
hand
the
fingers
curled
on
he
said
want
to
be
that
big
a
fool
was
hoping
for
this
brushed
at
his
eyes
with
his
free
hand
and
started
down
the
steps
held
the
razor
well
out
to
one
side
was
invulnerable
to
attack
but
he
could
be
handled
knew
if
he
could
be
brought
to
make
the
first
move
were
eight
feet
apart
when
cleared
the
last
step
waited
with
slack
arms
time
he
said
would
it
be
easier
if
put
my
hands
in
my
pockets
taunt
was
lost
on
advanced
slowly
directly
giving
no
hint
of
a
feint
to
either
side
was
just
short
of
reach
when
he
stopped
backed
off
two
steps
forcing
him
to
come
on
again
was
a
fixed
grin
on
face
made
hideous
by
the
swollen
nose
and
the
smeared
blood
backed
off
again
and
hesitated
then
came
along
moved
in
a
series
of
rhythmic
fits
and
starts
a
macabre
dance
two
steps
back
two
steps
forward
two
steps
back
felt
his
shoulders
come
up
against
the
wall
beside
the
heavy
slab
front
door
was
going
to
be
it
now
any
second
and
what
he
had
to
remember
was
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
razor
no
matter
what
even
if
should
feint
with
a
kick
to
the
groin
the
deadly
hand
was
his
exclusive
concern
kick
came
sudden
and
vicious
but
short
guts
twisted
with
the
effort
but
he
kept
his
eye
on
the
weapon
moved
in
a
silver
arc
toward
his
throat
then
veered
downward
hunched
his
left
shoulder
into
it
and
slashed
at
forearm
with
his
own
felt
the
blade
slide
off
his
sleeve
could
move
inside
to
cut
upward
toward
his
face
he
slammed
his
right
fist
into
belly
sagged
and
slashed
at
him
wildly
tripped
and
fell
to
one
side
landing
heavily
on
the
wood
floor
was
on
him
gasping
for
breath
and
for
a
couple
of
seconds
lost
sight
of
the
blade
felt
it
rip
at
the
side
of
his
jacket
and
a
momentary
sting
under
his
left
ribs
got
a
knee
up
into
belly
used
both
hands
and
heaved
him
clear
then
scrambled
to
his
feet
were
in
the
center
of
the
lobby
now
clutching
the
razor
came
up
into
a
crouch
shaking
his
head
he
charged
was
ready
hit
with
his
left
fist
in
the
ribs
and
the
razor
cut
toward
him
feebly
then
wobbled
in
his
right
fist
and
nearly
all
his
weight
behind
it
he
smashed
at
the
bloodstained
face
careened
backward
his
back
arched
fought
for
balance
and
failing
stumbled
against
the
newel
post
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
sound
of
his
head
striking
the
solid
wood
was
an
ultimate
sound
fell
on
his
side
across
the
lowest
step
rolled
over
once
then
lay
still
found
himself
leaning
against
the
desk
with
stiff
hands
panting
for
breath
a
minute
he
went
to
looked
at
one
of
his
eyes
and
felt
for
a
pulse
feel
any
appeared
to
be
dead
if
not
yet
then
soon
very
soon
it
was
cold
in
the
lobby
seemed
to
him
that
a
long
time
had
passed
before
he
decided
what
to
do
it
was
no
more
than
eight
or
ten
minutes
and
the
sum
of
his
reasoning
came
to
this
no
way
to
take
him
in
now
and
keep
those
other
two
and
the
one
who
hired
the
two
of
them
from
finding
out
about
and
lamming
out
local
law
here
would
hold
me
till
they
check
clear
back
home
and
maybe
more
than
that
would
have
to
then
they
could
never
catch
up
with
the
others
no
other
way
have
to
do
it
myself
looked
at
where
lay
sprawled
on
the
step
was
sure
now
he
was
dead
thing
he
thought
nobody
knows
about
it
yet
me
climbed
the
stairs
went
into
room
found
a
suitcase
and
packed
as
much
into
it
as
he
could
left
a
few
things
have
to
be
perfect
was
a
wastrel
away
on
impulse
he
might
logically
leave
behind
what
it
was
inconvenient
to
carry
he
had
closed
the
suitcase
he
found
a
rag
and
moved
about
the
room
wiping
carefully
everything
he
might
have
touched
took
him
nearly
an
hour
went
to
the
room
he
had
rented
and
got
into
his
overcoat
left
the
rest
of
his
things
and
returned
to
the
lobby
set
suitcase
near
the
front
door
went
outside
and
walked
back
to
the
garage
was
mildly
surprised
to
find
it
was
snowing
snowed
softly
silently
an
undulating
interruption
of
his
vision
against
the
night
sky
could
feel
it
on
his
face
and
in
his
hair
found
the
key
to
the
got
it
started
and
warmed
it
up
for
five
minutes
he
backed
out
and
swung
around
to
the
front
drive
went
into
the
hotel
and
searched
till
he
found
the
razor
put
it
in
his
own
pocket
for
safekeeping
took
the
suitcase
out
to
the
and
put
it
in
the
front
seat
he
went
back
for
body
was
heavier
than
he
had
anticipated
got
it
onto
his
shoulder
after
some
work
and
carried
it
outside
and
down
to
the
dumped
it
into
the
back
and
made
sure
it
roll
out
then
returned
to
the
porch
and
closed
the
front
door
making
sure
it
was
unlocked
drove
carefully
in
the
direction
of
the
brief
tour
they
had
taken
earlier
snowed
continuously
but
quietly
evenly
he
reached
the
dip
in
the
woods
he
saw
that
already
the
earlier
ruts
were
barely
discernible
fought
its
way
through
the
low
spot
and
got
onto
higher
ground
drove
in
low
gear
to
the
fork
in
the
road
and
swung
as
close
as
possible
to
the
entrance
to
the
abandoned
mine
parked
facing
it
and
left
the
headlights
on
but
when
he
started
into
the
tunnel
with
the
suitcase
he
found
the
illumination
extended
no
farther
than
half
a
dozen
feet
into
the
passage
went
back
and
got
the
flashlight
returned
to
the
tunnel
and
carried
the
suitcase
to
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
had
found
earlier
tossed
the
bag
into
the
pit
and
watched
dry
dust
spray
up
around
it
the
dust
settled
he
went
back
to
the
and
carefully
worked
body
onto
his
shoulder
like
carrying
the
suitcase
soft
snow
was
deceitful
underfoot
he
nearly
fell
the
passage
he
had
to
work
his
way
over
the
fallen
timber
and
nearly
collapsed
under
his
clumsy
burden
the
time
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
pit
he
was
panting
and
his
shoulder
and
back
ached
under
the
drag
of
the
dead
weight
stood
looking
down
for
a
few
seconds
then
backed
up
two
or
three
paces
from
the
edge
was
too
much
weight
casually
to
toss
it
away
could
feel
himself
falling
in
with
it
and
being
unable
to
get
out
would
be
a
bad
place
to
die
was
a
bad
place
for
to
wind
up
but
had
asked
for
it
was
too
late
to
worry
about
that
knelt
slowly
and
dumped
the
corpse
onto
the
floor
of
the
tunnel
was
a
relief
to
get
rid
of
the
weight
was
shaking
with
tension
and
it
took
him
a
couple
of
minutes
to
get
his
breath
and
settle
down
he
got
on
his
knees
and
rolled
body
toward
the
edge
hung
momentarily
on
the
point
of
dropping
off
gave
it
a
strong
push
heard
it
slide
then
tumble
dryly
into
the
hole
got
to
his
feet
and
threw
the
flashlight
beam
into
the
pit
body
lay
in
an
awkward
sprawl
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
below
the
level
of
the
tunnel
floor
enough
he
decided
was
little
chance
anyone
would
enter
this
shaft
during
the
winter
external
signs
of
his
approach
to
it
would
be
covered
by
the
snow
probably
by
the
next
day
cold
enough
in
the
tunnel
to
preserve
the
body
intact
spring
it
would
be
a
skeleton
made
his
way
back
to
the
had
started
to
back
into
the
turn
when
he
remembered
the
razor
in
his
pocket
climbed
down
went
back
into
the
tunnel
and
tossed
the
razor
into
the
pit
landed
on
sprawled
right
thigh
poised
precariously
then
slid
off
to
the
ground
went
back
once
more
to
the
and
started
the
short
drive
to
the
hotel
the
garage
he
checked
the
for
signs
of
the
use
he
had
made
of
it
were
stains
here
and
there
and
he
cleaned
them
off
using
an
oiled
rag
he
found
on
a
nail
wiped
the
steering
wheel
and
all
the
places
he
might
have
touched
the
replaced
the
flashlight
where
it
had
been
stowed
got
into
his
own
car
and
backed
it
out
of
the
garage
were
tire
marks
where
it
had
been
but
they
were
overlapped
by
others
and
on
the
dusty
floor
would
not
be
noticeable
except
under
close
scrutiny
he
thought
might
spend
some
time
grieving
for
her
lost
lover
but
he
doubted
that
she
would
launch
an
investigation
judged
her
to
be
a
woman
of
some
pride
though
not
much
sense
she
would
probably
have
sense
enough
not
to
call
in
the
local
sheriff
to
find
her
boy
friend
who
apparently
had
run
away
put
in
a
call
to
from
his
hotel
room
maid
answered
and
he
decided
must
be
at
work
cautioned
him
not
to
be
too
hopeful
and
then
ignoring
his
own
advice
said
excitedly
it
does
sound
good
woman
named
who
tells
nobody
anything
about
herself
courtyard
picture
with
the
same
initials
not
exactly
jumping
up
and
down
with
enthusiasm
call
you
in
a
day
or
so
the
highway
he
relaxed
and
enjoyed
the
drive
over
and
along
the
coast
was
ten
miles
inland
more
of
a
quaint
old
coast
town
than
those
along
the
beach
made
garish
by
tourist
attractions
checked
into
a
motel
and
drove
downtown
courthouse
was
a
building
minus
the
customary
dome
of
the
usual
straggling
privet
hedges
and
patches
of
bare
dirt
in
most
squares
the
building
was
hemmed
in
by
a
semitropical
growth
of
camellias
and
azaleas
and
a
smooth
lawn
the
improbably
shade
of
grass
figured
his
best
bet
was
a
call
on
the
sheriff
clerk
in
the
outer
office
took
him
in
to
a
big
paunchy
man
with
thick
white
hair
and
a
voice
with
a
senatorial
resonance
which
suggested
he
should
be
running
for
higher
office
in
front
of
the
desk
said
looking
for
some
information
with
very
little
to
go
on
explained
the
background
of
the
case
ending
with
the
tenuous
clue
which
had
brought
him
to
swivel
chair
tilted
back
looking
for
a
woman
who
married
a
man
who
might
have
lived
here
a
year
ago
and
might
have
been
poisoned
there
was
such
a
person
afraid
she
got
away
with
it
we
know
more
about
him
think
the
best
bet
is
to
go
through
the
society
columns
of
last
year
and
see
if
any
of
the
grooms
match
with
the
obituaries
a
little
later
be
a
tedious
job
but
if
you
want
to
try
it
the
old
newspaper
files
are
in
the
basement
here
in
the
county
office
the
society
editor
would
remember
a
bride
an
idea
has
been
society
editor
here
for
years
editor
says
that
marriages
may
be
made
in
heaven
but
weddings
are
made
in
columns
the
one
who
decides
which
wedding
is
to
get
the
lead
space
in
the
paper
and
all
that
smiled
when
the
editor
was
just
out
of
the
hospital
from
a
gallstone
operation
and
the
mother
of
the
bride
went
out
to
his
house
and
fought
it
out
beside
his
bed
be
sure
to
remember
any
bride
who
was
vague
about
background
have
made
a
great
scientist
dedicated
to
tracking
down
heredity
and
environment
also
remember
if
the
groom
died
later
stood
up
wish
you
good
luck
but
please
dig
up
too
tough
a
case
for
me
this
close
to
election
you
find
out
anything
come
on
back
here
and
get
started
on
it
down
was
like
trying
to
catch
up
with
between
and
turned
out
that
she
also
sold
real
estate
cosmetics
and
hospital
insurance
wearying
trek
stretched
into
the
afternoon
from
newspaper
plant
to
insurance
office
to
her
house
and
back
to
the
newspaper
where
he
found
her
at
five
was
a
large
woman
with
a
frizzled
gray
poodle
cut
and
a
pencil
clamped
like
a
bit
between
her
teeth
while
she
hunted
and
pecked
on
an
old
typewriter
took
a
couple
of
minutes
to
run
through
her
various
businesses
and
get
down
to
the
one
he
wanted
year
do
remember
one
a
man
named
remember
her
because
she
want
her
picture
in
the
paper
bride
like
that
seen
in
years
reason
did
she
give
she
had
a
on
her
face
some
sort
of
allergy
and
none
of
her
old
pictures
was
good
enough
see
her
till
several
days
later
at
the
wedding
and
her
face
looked
like
it
had
never
had
a
blemish
on
it
of
course
you
see
too
well
through
the
veil
her
name
how
in
hell
would
remember
that
mind
can
look
it
up
they
still
live
here
think
they
moved
away
shortly
after
they
were
married
was
a
salesman
for
something
or
other
and
must
have
been
transferred
sure
be
in
the
files
usually
run
a
social
note
when
somebody
moves
away
stood
up
and
thanked
her
they
inherited
some
money
or
something
asked
with
a
reportorial
gleam
in
her
eye
said
vaguely
it
is
a
little
legal
matter
but
nothing
like
that
hurried
across
to
the
courthouse
and
caught
the
sheriff
just
as
he
was
leaving
like
what
after
he
said
when
had
finished
on
hurry
down
before
they
lock
up
for
the
day
the
basement
the
sheriff
took
him
to
a
small
dingy
office
occupied
by
a
tall
thin
man
informal
in
shirt
sleeves
chairman
of
the
board
of
supervisors
is
a
private
detective
to
look
up
something
in
the
newspaper
files
so
lock
him
in
here
said
just
leave
the
door
open
latches
when
you
close
it
so
stay
as
long
as
you
like
crossed
the
room
to
a
metal
door
with
an
open
grillework
in
the
top
half
pulled
it
open
shut
this
door
open
from
inside
we
built
the
new
jail
we
used
to
keep
prisoners
in
here
overnight
sometimes
when
the
old
jail
got
too
crowded
treats
himself
a
lot
better
than
we
do
prisoners
were
a
sight
more
comfortable
than
the
ones
in
the
jail
with
the
cold
air
from
air
conditioner
coming
through
the
grille
walked
past
the
sheriff
into
a
windowless
room
with
shelves
full
of
big
volumes
from
floor
to
ceiling
all
around
the
walls
metal
table
and
four
chairs
stood
in
the
center
all
here
back
to
told
him
all
right
to
smoke
but
make
sure
your
cigarettes
are
out
before
you
leave
of
course
you
know
not
to
take
clippings
leave
the
air
conditioner
on
for
you
said
forget
to
turn
it
off
and
close
the
door
good
so
latch
thanked
them
and
promised
to
observe
the
rules
they
had
gone
he
stood
for
a
minute
breathing
in
the
mustiness
of
old
paper
and
leather
which
the
busily
thrumming
air
conditioner
quite
dispel
fourteen
a
tour
around
the
stacks
he
found
that
the
earliest
volumes
began
on
the
left
and
progressed
clockwise
around
the
room
old
weakness
for
burrowing
in
records
rose
up
to
tempt
him
was
indeed
all
here
almost
a
century
reconstruction
to
moon
rockets
he
pulled
away
from
the
irrelevant
old
volumes
and
walked
around
to
the
newer
ones
volume
was
at
the
top
a
couple
of
inches
below
the
ceiling
it
was
a
metal
ladder
on
casters
attached
to
the
top
shelf
pulled
it
over
climbed
up
and
lifted
out
the
big
volume
almost
losing
his
balance
from
the
weight
of
it
staggered
over
and
dropped
it
on
the
table
remembered
only
that
the
marriage
had
been
in
the
spring
he
started
to
plod
through
several
months
tried
to
turn
right
to
the
society
page
in
each
one
but
interesting
stories
kept
cropping
up
to
distract
him
last
he
found
it
in
the
paper
of
told
him
little
more
than
had
remembered
stating
that
it
had
been
a
small
modest
wedding
compared
to
some
of
the
others
was
a
marked
contrast
in
the
amount
of
information
on
bride
and
groom
life
was
an
open
book
so
to
speak
from
his
birth
in
through
his
days
at
and
his
attainment
of
a
degree
which
had
presumably
prepared
him
for
his
career
as
district
sales
manager
for
one
line
on
the
bride
said
she
was
from
mention
of
was
beginning
to
feel
sharp
concern
for
was
who
he
thought
she
was
selling
days
might
well
be
over
for
their
exodus
from
time
the
search
took
twice
as
long
cutting
down
on
his
extra
reading
for
he
had
to
pick
through
several
columns
of
and
social
notes
in
each
issue
found
it
in
the
edition
of
item
said
and
had
moved
to
his
home
town
so
the
lovely
had
been
with
him
a
year
ago
on
his
program
was
a
call
to
the
office
of
to
find
out
if
was
still
with
them
or
more
specifically
still
with
us
glanced
at
his
watch
saw
it
was
only
seven
and
decided
to
indulge
his
weakness
now
the
next
hour
he
scrambled
happily
up
and
down
the
ladder
sharing
the
excitement
of
reporters
who
had
seen
assassination
the
fire
in
and
the
trial
the
middle
of
the
stock
market
crash
he
heard
a
slight
noise
in
the
outer
office
turned
around
saw
nothing
and
decided
it
must
be
a
mouse
else
distracted
him
yet
there
was
no
sound
only
tomblike
silence
he
knew
it
was
not
sound
but
lack
of
it
air
conditioner
was
no
longer
running
jumped
up
and
turned
around
to
see
the
metal
door
closing
clanged
shut
as
he
sprang
toward
it
pressed
his
face
against
the
grille
there
light
shining
through
the
grille
dimly
illumined
the
office
beyond
enough
for
him
to
see
there
was
no
one
there
he
heard
the
outer
door
closing
come
back
he
shouted
thought
it
must
be
some
damn
janitor
or
cleaning
woman
puttering
around
figuring
that
had
gone
off
and
forgotten
to
turn
off
everything
and
lock
up
the
faint
beginnings
of
fear
stirred
in
his
mind
he
was
the
person
just
left
have
missed
seeing
through
the
open
door
of
the
brightly
lighted
room
even
if
somehow
missed
seeing
him
he
have
gone
off
and
left
the
light
on
and
door
open
in
the
file
room
it
was
had
meant
to
shut
him
up
in
here
had
followed
him
and
waited
till
the
courthouse
and
square
were
deserted
why
search
his
room
at
the
motel
come
back
later
and
kill
him
after
the
stores
had
closed
around
the
square
and
everybody
had
left
they
could
kill
him
just
as
easy
right
now
could
hear
what
was
going
on
in
this
underground
vault
he
heard
it
and
smelled
it
the
steady
hissing
the
dread
familiar
pungency
of
gas
escaping
must
be
coming
from
an
upright
heater
against
the
far
wall
in
the
office
now
and
had
been
like
an
anagram
which
he
could
unscramble
at
his
own
pace
and
choosing
for
those
minutes
in
her
room
he
had
lost
touch
with
her
as
a
reality
obsession
and
reminiscences
had
mesmerized
him
into
thinking
of
and
separately
or
together
as
a
legend
kept
drifting
apart
and
merging
again
in
his
mind
like
some
minute
form
of
life
on
a
microscope
slide
said
take
a
little
time
to
think
it
over
was
awkward
very
awkward
would
be
all
the
nuisance
of
contacting
someone
else
to
take
over
reasonably
trustworthy
would
hear
about
it
knew
said
and
he
smiled
very
sweet
and
slow
at
too
much
time
because
be
needing
some
more
myself
pretty
much
right
away
done
favors
for
you
big
favor
not
so
long
back
and
right
here
to
take
on
where
left
off
trouble
want
no
trouble
you
want
no
trouble
nobody
wants
trouble
heaven
no
thought
turning
away
as
another
man
came
in
straightened
his
tie
at
the
mirror
with
a
shaking
hand
the
genial
smile
seemed
painted
on
his
face
knew
of
dangerous
information
knew
too
much
entirely
already
he
had
at
bay
favor
done
you
this
deal
and
kinda
fire
it
maybe
been
kinda
over
that
say
blame
you
said
thoughtfully
deal
with
the
ace
spades
to
do
with
an
ace
spades
bad
luck
of
spades
a
widow
that
was
what
they
called
a
widow
these
crooks
remembered
distractedly
about
that
knew
too
things
got
a
little
out
of
hand
they
very
rapidly
got
a
lot
out
of
hand
it
seemed
to
be
a
general
rule
just
by
chance
and
in
a
way
tracing
back
to
poor
all
of
it
because
naturally
brothers
living
together
and
did
not
at
all
like
the
look
on
almost
girlishly
face
or
indeed
anything
about
was
not
a
man
who
thought
very
much
about
moral
principles
he
found
money
much
more
interesting
but
all
the
same
he
thought
now
uneasily
of
the
way
in
which
earned
his
living
and
paid
for
his
own
stuff
and
eyed
the
soft
smile
and
the
dark
eyes
and
he
felt
a
little
ill
my
friend
he
said
in
my
life
learn
how
is
it
the
proverb
says
better
an
ounce
of
prevention
to
a
pound
of
cure
stay
in
business
so
long
because
careful
weeks
a
month
we
talk
it
over
again
and
maybe
if
nothing
happens
meanwhile
to
say
the
cops
know
this
and
that
then
we
make
a
little
deal
it
a
long
while
said
tell
you
you
want
to
leave
it
that
way
fool
around
with
it
go
over
to
and
get
fixed
up
there
wait
no
two
weeks
like
but
what
with
and
three
of
his
boys
inside
and
not
likely
to
come
out
such
a
valuable
salesman
said
the
nuisance
and
danger
of
getting
in
touch
with
practically
a
whole
new
bunch
of
boys
did
everything
have
to
happen
at
once
said
stupidly
you
turning
down
are
you
mean
we
all
figured
guess
figure
gave
him
an
affectionate
smile
too
smart
a
fellow
want
to
get
rid
of
me
he
said
it
the
name
repeated
over
and
over
anybody
to
hear
being
a
fool
knew
why
aside
from
everything
else
it
would
scarcely
be
pleasant
to
have
dealings
with
one
who
was
nominally
an
underling
and
actually
held
you
could
say
the
whip
hand
all
because
of
had
dreamed
of
all
the
trouble
that
young
man
would
eventually
cause
course
there
was
another
factor
worth
his
weight
in
gold
right
now
but
these
users
they
sometimes
went
down
fast
knew
might
not
last
long
sweat
broke
out
on
forehead
as
he
realized
he
had
been
actually
thinking
hoping
planning
perhaps
above
had
not
been
enough
patted
thin
shoulder
paternally
you
want
to
go
talking
that
way
he
said
sure
the
one
take
over
for
soon
as
get
the
supply
get
started
up
again
it
need
worry
tell
you
know
how
it
is
with
you
my
friend
sympathize
and
make
it
a
special
point
a
special
favor
get
in
touch
and
get
some
stuff
just
for
you
know
if
can
manage
it
tonight
or
tomorrow
but
try
my
best
my
friend
see
you
got
to
remember
we
all
got
schedules
like
any
business
man
he
be
around
a
little
while
he
just
fixed
me
up
with
this
stuff
they
took
out
of
the
awkward
you
see
that
it
your
business
said
and
his
dreamy
eyes
moved
past
shoulder
to
gaze
vaguely
out
the
window
appreciate
it
you
do
that
none
of
us
want
no
trouble
in
a
room
over
the
on
you
just
ask
for
me
there
you
want
see
me
maybe
call
you
tonight
nine
call
and
see
if
you
got
any
couple
decks
for
me
and
to
sell
see
like
to
have
a
little
ready
cash
now
know
about
that
much
said
you
know
he
always
keeps
it
a
strict
cash
basis
like
they
say
said
a
throw
that
the
deal
bring
you
the
cash
say
five
hundred
for
ten
decks
mind
how
much
cut
it
how
much
get
and
he
smiled
his
sleepy
smile
again
deal
go
have
a
look
round
for
it
do
my
best
said
earnestly
just
for
you
my
friend
is
awkward
for
everybody
it
we
all
got
to
put
up
with
inconvenience
sometimes
do
my
best
for
you
got
out
of
there
in
a
hurry
brushing
past
another
man
in
the
door
mopping
his
brow
expedient
thing
yes
very
true
one
must
make
do
as
one
could
in
some
situations
could
all
be
straightened
out
later
very
much
later
but
when
things
had
settled
down
a
little
this
deal
with
the
woman
went
through
ace
of
spades
was
not
a
superstitious
man
but
he
felt
perhaps
there
was
a
little
something
in
that
indeed
rather
wished
he
had
never
got
into
the
business
and
still
scarcely
to
be
resisted
a
nice
little
profit
with
not
much
work
involved
easy
money
who
would
be
so
very
soon
now
rang
up
her
first
sale
of
the
day
and
counted
back
the
change
did
not
notice
that
the
customer
seized
her
purchase
and
turned
away
without
a
smile
or
a
word
of
thanks
she
marked
the
few
who
did
thank
you
you
get
that
kind
much
in
a
place
like
this
and
she
played
a
little
game
with
herself
seeing
how
downright
rude
she
could
act
to
the
others
before
take
offense
threaten
to
call
the
manager
how
seldom
they
did
used
to
it
probably
kind
who
came
into
a
cheap
store
like
this
snatch
saw
that
first
take
this
was
before
her
you
wait
on
me
now
or
bother
with
it
see
kind
of
place
be
through
here
just
no
time
at
all
leave
this
kind
of
thing
behind
at
noon
and
never
come
back
have
to
a
lot
of
money
enough
be
smart
about
it
get
him
to
give
it
to
her
in
little
bills
nobody
would
suspect
maybe
get
it
until
account
of
that
the
banks
that
really
long
to
wait
when
waited
so
long
already
need
say
anything
at
all
to
the
old
woman
had
it
all
planned
out
how
do
say
she
feel
good
on
go
to
church
be
a
little
argument
but
she
could
be
stubborn
and
when
the
old
woman
had
gone
quick
pack
the
things
need
to
take
all
but
the
dress
wear
and
take
the
bag
down
to
that
place
in
the
station
where
you
could
put
things
in
a
locker
overnight
for
a
dime
on
morning
or
it
might
have
to
be
get
up
and
leave
just
the
usual
time
and
last
thing
put
the
money
in
an
envelope
under
the
old
purse
there
in
the
drawer
be
going
to
get
that
for
an
hour
or
so
after
had
left
go
do
the
daily
shopping
need
leave
a
note
with
it
either
or
maybe
just
something
like
worry
about
me
going
away
to
make
a
better
life
better
life
as
if
she
wanted
much
mind
working
hard
not
as
if
she
figured
to
do
anything
wrong
to
live
easy
and
soft
all
she
wanted
was
a
chance
where
she
marked
as
what
she
was
be
and
work
in
a
nicer
shop
somewhere
at
a
little
more
money
so
she
could
have
prettier
clothes
and
learn
manners
and
all
like
that
and
get
to
know
different
people
than
up
to
now
not
just
the
ones
like
her
here
with
names
the
ones
went
to
the
same
church
and
place
different
job
different
people
be
all
different
too
do
her
hair
another
way
smarter
and
wear
different
kinds
of
clothes
be
just
what
that
sounded
like
give
me
the
wrong
change
said
the
customer
sharply
count
made
up
the
amount
in
indifferent
silence
was
listening
to
other
voices
out
of
the
future
of
those
new
different
people
awfully
nice
and
pretty
too
like
ask
to
go
with
us
always
lots
of
fun
very
soon
now
sixteen
wake
until
nearly
was
going
to
be
another
hot
day
already
the
thermometer
stood
close
to
ninety
was
still
sound
asleep
he
made
fresh
coffee
and
searched
through
all
the
desk
drawers
for
more
cigarettes
before
thinking
of
her
handbag
and
found
a
crumpled
stray
cigarette
at
its
bottom
which
tasted
peculiarly
of
face
powder
left
a
note
propped
on
the
desk
asking
her
to
call
him
sometime
today
and
drove
home
got
out
fresh
liver
for
he
paused
to
look
at
her
crouched
daintily
over
her
dish
she
was
just
a
trifle
fatter
around
the
middle
seemed
to
remember
reading
somewhere
that
had
large
litters
and
suffered
a
dismaying
vision
of
the
apartment
overrun
with
a
dozen
kittens
que
sigue
despues
then
asked
her
severely
lot
of
people
are
so
peculiar
that
they
like
cats
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
find
good
homes
for
kittens
and
damn
it
you
know
very
well
if
have
them
around
long
impossible
to
give
them
away
suppose
now
that
finally
grown
up
if
a
little
late
go
on
producing
kittens
every
six
months
or
so
well
a
pity
to
spoil
your
girlish
figure
which
all
those
kittens
would
do
anyway
but
think
when
raised
these
just
have
the
vet
fix
it
so
there
be
any
more
wonder
if
the
would
take
one
no
good
looking
at
me
like
that
as
she
wound
affectionately
around
his
ankles
long
nose
unexpectedly
wrinkled
up
to
be
in
the
hall
to
hear
you
quarrel
about
her
well
you
really
blame
lost
her
beau
to
you
she
was
talking
of
when
she
saw
the
black
line
of
the
open
door
remembered
it
clearly
went
on
got
to
get
busy
taken
to
her
bed
with
the
door
locked
opened
it
an
inch
and
poked
out
the
keys
for
me
to
give
you
thrust
a
bundle
of
keys
strung
on
a
thick
red
cord
into
hand
that
much
use
in
locking
up
the
smokehouse
and
the
storehouse
now
your
coffee
coffee
cold
suddenly
looked
quite
capable
of
pouring
it
down
her
throat
want
it
said
firmly
take
it
down
with
me
as
go
swooped
up
the
cup
and
hiked
up
her
top
hoop
as
if
about
to
take
off
with
a
racing
start
the
door
she
turned
back
her
nose
looking
very
long
now
and
satiric
forgot
and
have
gone
after
them
just
like
that
book
your
friend
wrote
except
there
any
ice
floes
to
cross
and
no
bloodhounds
know
can
they
do
if
they
find
them
do
anything
silly
childish
running
after
them
like
that
told
so
of
course
the
paterollers
be
of
any
help
not
with
everything
so
upset
and
that
cavalry
outfit
they
say
is
running
around
knows
where
had
swished
away
she
had
been
gone
for
a
long
time
probably
when
suddenly
realized
that
she
ought
to
stop
her
pour
out
the
coffee
so
no
one
would
drink
it
then
the
coffee
was
bad
enough
at
best
cold
it
was
all
but
undrinkable
especially
that
cup
was
deeply
horribly
sure
that
had
filled
it
with
opium
had
quarreled
with
she
had
resisted
his
demands
for
money
and
if
she
died
by
the
provisions
of
her
marriage
contract
would
inherit
legally
not
only
the
immediate
sum
of
gold
under
the
floorboards
in
the
office
but
later
when
the
war
was
over
her
entire
estate
felt
cold
and
hot
sticky
and
chilly
at
the
same
time
wait
a
minute
she
told
herself
think
about
it
is
not
the
only
person
in
this
house
who
could
have
put
opium
in
that
coffee
had
lost
a
bottle
of
opium
but
that
was
on
the
trip
from
someone
had
taken
it
during
her
first
day
at
she
had
missed
it
after
her
talk
with
after
dinner
just
before
was
shot
or
had
entered
her
room
while
she
slept
bringing
back
her
washed
clothes
somebody
else
could
have
come
in
too
then
or
later
while
she
was
out
of
the
room
would
have
been
easy
to
identify
as
opium
by
its
odor
was
not
very
reasonable
to
believe
that
had
procured
unprocurable
opium
and
come
back
to
with
a
formed
plan
to
murder
her
even
know
that
she
was
there
he
certainly
have
guessed
that
she
would
resist
his
demand
for
the
gold
or
that
she
was
not
the
yielding
yes
and
credible
fool
he
had
every
right
to
expect
he
had
been
surprised
unpleasantly
surprised
but
surprised
somebody
else
question
had
said
invite
danger
skin
crawled
had
told
that
she
was
in
the
hall
and
the
door
was
open
had
begun
to
tell
of
she
had
begun
to
question
and
a
little
draft
had
crept
across
the
room
from
the
bedroom
door
open
barely
enough
to
show
a
rim
of
blackness
in
the
hall
or
anybody
could
have
listened
and
that
somebody
could
have
already
been
supplied
with
the
missing
bottle
of
opium
was
not
reasonable
either
opium
had
disappeared
before
death
and
whoever
shot
him
could
not
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
have
foreseen
own
doubts
and
suspicions
and
questions
began
to
doubt
whether
there
had
been
in
fact
a
lethal
dose
of
opium
in
the
cup
suppose
somebody
only
wished
to
frighten
her
so
she
would
leave
made
a
certain
amount
of
logic
to
the
argument
was
the
fact
that
while
she
might
have
tasted
the
coffee
if
it
had
been
still
hot
she
might
even
have
drunk
some
of
it
she
have
taken
enough
to
kill
her
for
she
would
have
been
warned
by
its
taste
was
merely
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
go
back
to
as
suggested
she
run
like
a
scared
cat
well
be
very
careful
dressed
and
the
accustomed
routine
restored
to
her
a
sense
of
normal
everyday
life
before
she
left
her
room
she
dug
into
her
big
moire
bag
took
out
the
envelope
holding
her
marriage
contract
and
the
wax
seal
had
been
broken
somebody
else
knew
what
would
happen
to
her
money
if
she
died
had
known
all
along
need
to
break
the
wax
seal
read
the
contract
and
find
out
could
conceivably
have
wished
to
make
sure
loved
it
was
like
a
part
of
his
breath
and
body
had
stressed
the
need
for
money
would
never
have
tried
to
give
her
poison
thrust
the
envelope
back
in
the
bag
there
was
no
point
in
locking
it
up
in
the
armoire
now
it
was
like
locking
the
barn
after
the
horse
was
stolen
in
all
likelihood
by
now
there
was
more
than
one
person
in
the
house
who
knew
the
terms
of
her
marriage
contract
was
no
point
either
in
telling
herself
again
what
a
fool
been
went
downstairs
and
received
another
curious
shock
for
when
flapped
into
the
dining
room
in
her
homemade
moccasins
asked
her
when
she
had
brought
coffee
to
her
room
and
said
she
much
work
this
morning
everybody
gone
like
that
swallowed
past
another
kind
of
constriction
in
her
throat
then
who
brought
it
come
to
the
kitchen
and
say
she
take
it
up
to
you
put
down
a
dish
of
lukewarm
rice
much
breakfast
this
morning
know
what
going
to
do
got
to
eat
said
curtly
because
a
chill
crawled
over
her
again
flapped
away
rice
dosed
with
opium
indeed
it
had
no
taste
at
all
not
a
grain
of
salt
ate
what
she
could
and
went
out
along
the
covered
passageway
with
the
rain
dripping
from
the
vines
the
kitchen
was
despairingly
picking
chickens
a
basket
told
her
go
to
the
storehouse
dropped
a
chicken
and
a
flurry
of
feathers
and
went
with
her
through
the
drizzle
to
the
storehouse
found
the
right
key
and
unlocked
the
door
was
a
long
low
room
like
a
root
cellar
for
it
was
banked
up
with
soil
and
vines
had
run
rampant
over
that
too
was
dark
but
dry
and
cool
doled
out
what
vaguely
guessed
were
the
right
amounts
of
dried
peas
eggs
cornmeal
a
little
salt
shelves
looked
emptier
than
when
had
shown
her
the
storeroom
and
since
the
men
from
the
had
called
there
were
certainly
now
fewer
mouths
to
feed
but
there
was
less
to
feed
them
with
took
to
the
smokehouse
unlocked
it
and
saw
with
satisfaction
there
was
still
a
quantity
of
hams
and
sides
of
bacon
hanging
from
the
rafters
go
hungry
not
yet
the
fields
were
green
and
growing
you
possibly
imagine
what
life
is
going
to
be
like
here
had
said
sent
back
to
the
house
her
basket
and
her
apron
laden
stood
for
a
moment
rain
dripping
from
the
trees
over
her
head
thinking
of
had
the
opportunity
to
take
the
bottle
of
opium
from
room
had
the
cool
ruthlessness
to
do
whatever
she
made
up
her
mind
to
do
see
how
her
death
could
affect
see
any
reason
why
would
attempt
to
frighten
her
there
was
something
hysterical
and
silly
something
almost
childish
about
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
was
neither
hysterical
nor
silly
and
rather
doubted
if
she
had
ever
been
childish
had
suggested
that
return
to
could
have
shot
if
had
a
reason
to
kill
him
was
no
use
in
standing
there
in
the
drizzle
trying
to
find
a
link
between
murder
and
opium
in
a
cup
of
coffee
started
back
for
the
house
saw
a
light
in
the
office
opened
the
door
and
surprised
a
domestic
little
scene
which
was
far
outside
the
dark
realm
of
murder
or
attempted
murder
and
were
mending
shoes
lighted
lamp
stood
on
the
table
that
dusky
drizzling
day
were
all
three
bent
over
a
shabby
riding
boot
had
a
tack
hammer
held
a
patch
of
leather
steadied
something
a
tiny
brad
waiting
for
poised
hammer
said
thing
do
when
get
to
again
is
get
me
a
boots
on
laughed
softly
looked
up
and
saw
her
looked
up
and
stiffened
look
up
at
all
was
no
way
to
know
no
way
to
guess
whether
any
one
of
them
was
surprised
at
appearance
believing
her
to
be
drugged
and
senseless
and
just
possibly
dead
said
in
you
know
the
news
what
news
thought
as
satirically
as
might
have
said
it
face
was
suddenly
a
little
fixed
and
questioning
turned
to
and
your
shop
somewhere
else
want
to
talk
to
in
the
office
the
spreading
circle
of
lamplight
the
patch
of
leather
in
hands
poised
with
the
tack
hammer
the
homely
everyday
atmosphere
all
denied
an
attempt
at
murder
rush
of
panic
caught
now
mean
got
to
to
see
to
the
kitchen
words
jumbled
together
and
she
all
but
ran
from
the
office
and
from
the
question
in
face
why
did
do
that
thought
as
warm
drizzling
rain
touched
her
face
was
no
schoolgirl
refusing
to
bear
tales
she
reached
the
kitchen
door
the
answer
presented
itself
if
she
told
anyone
of
the
opium
it
must
be
her
husband
might
be
indeed
it
had
already
proved
to
be
a
marriage
without
love
but
it
was
marriage
she
choose
as
a
confidant
it
must
be
provided
that
himself
had
not
dosed
her
coffee
with
opium
she
thought
as
coldly
and
sharply
again
as
might
have
said
it
paused
at
the
kitchen
door
caught
her
breath
told
herself
firmly
that
the
opium
was
only
an
attempt
to
frighten
her
and
went
into
the
kitchen
where
was
eyeing
the
chickens
dismally
and
was
cleaning
lamp
chimneys
gave
a
gulp
cut
up
no
chicken
say
she
the
homely
everyday
details
of
daily
living
refuted
a
vicious
attempt
to
frighten
her
or
to
murder
her
homely
everyday
details
of
living
and
domestic
requirements
also
pressed
upon
her
with
their
immediate
urgency
matter
what
had
happened
or
happened
somebody
had
to
see
about
dinner
eyed
the
chickens
with
if
she
had
known
it
something
of
dismal
look
and
thought
with
a
certain
fury
of
the
time
she
had
spent
on
verbs
since
last
night
think
there
was
any
reason
to
there
to
him
again
anyway
talking
to
some
of
the
fellows
he
works
with
friends
anyone
to
find
out
how
happy
he
is
with
his
wife
whether
he
plays
around
with
women
might
try
looking
into
his
wife
too
might
have
been
talking
to
some
of
her
friends
about
her
husband
if
been
having
any
trouble
think
the
one
looking
for
think
he
might
be
said
grimly
again
he
might
not
a
stinking
world
said
is
best
friend
know
you
be
coming
back
soon
think
so
on
my
way
to
see
the
woman
secretary
for
think
is
the
think
anything
just
want
to
go
off
before
picking
up
all
interrupted
says
he
was
in
his
office
all
day
with
her
yesterday
like
to
make
sure
just
possible
she
might
know
something
about
see
you
later
you
ever
going
to
go
home
sure
as
hell
look
like
it
does
it
telling
you
if
these
corpses
ever
knew
the
trouble
they
put
us
to
think
twice
before
letting
themselves
get
knocked
off
to
tell
that
to
the
next
corpse
you
meet
hung
up
and
sat
on
the
small
bench
massaging
his
right
leg
looked
at
his
watch
was
ten
minutes
before
eleven
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
had
a
signed
confession
from
experience
let
him
know
even
at
this
early
stage
that
was
his
man
he
still
wanted
to
know
why
was
a
cold
windy
day
the
day
after
death
but
paid
no
attention
to
the
blustery
wind
leaving
had
no
destination
simply
walked
not
noticing
where
he
was
not
caring
stopped
automatically
at
the
street
corners
waiting
for
the
traffic
lights
to
change
unheeding
of
other
people
his
coat
open
and
flapping
he
walked
he
tried
to
think
himself
of
what
had
tried
to
make
him
believe
was
nothing
coherent
about
his
thinking
was
a
succession
of
passing
through
his
mind
the
same
ones
different
ones
in
no
apparent
sequence
in
no
logical
succession
enormity
of
what
had
told
him
made
it
impossible
for
to
accept
with
any
degree
of
realism
the
actuality
of
it
words
had
intellectual
meaning
for
him
only
they
penetrated
him
not
at
all
he
was
and
your
wife
were
intimate
remembered
exact
words
made
sense
and
yet
they
knew
had
told
him
the
truth
was
so
it
so
so
because
it
be
so
was
alive
and
he
remembered
the
pressure
of
her
hand
resting
lightly
on
his
arm
she
had
been
the
center
of
his
life
was
the
sun
he
the
closest
planet
orbiting
around
her
the
rest
of
the
world
existing
and
visible
yet
removed
years
he
had
lived
progressing
towards
a
eating
working
breathing
without
plan
without
reason
had
come
along
to
justify
everything
was
his
goal
she
was
his
reason
had
lived
all
his
life
waiting
for
her
once
in
the
time
that
he
had
known
her
had
he
ever
considered
the
possibility
not
once
not
for
one
of
a
second
of
her
infidelity
could
not
consider
it
now
really
so
he
walked
aimless
again
walk
ended
inevitably
right
in
front
of
his
hotel
building
doorman
began
to
nod
his
head
automatically
then
remembered
who
was
what
had
happened
to
him
the
night
before
looked
at
with
undisguised
curiosity
passed
by
him
without
seeing
him
crossed
the
lobby
and
rode
up
in
the
elevator
lost
in
his
own
thoughts
the
apartment
itself
all
was
still
police
were
no
longer
there
was
no
evidence
that
anything
was
different
than
it
had
been
that
there
taking
off
his
coat
he
sat
in
the
blue
chair
which
still
faced
the
closed
bedroom
door
last
sitting
there
in
the
familiar
surroundings
the
truth
began
to
sink
in
felt
no
anger
towards
no
sense
that
she
had
betrayed
him
was
all
he
had
everything
he
had
everything
he
wanted
had
taken
her
away
from
him
there
is
a
entry
in
the
ledger
there
is
a
one
he
remembered
from
his
school
days
there
is
a
victim
there
is
a
killer
he
was
and
your
wife
were
intimate
rose
from
the
chair
took
off
his
coat
he
went
into
the
bedroom
bed
still
showed
signs
of
where
had
lain
stood
there
for
a
long
time
looked
at
the
bed
unblinkingly
bed
was
empty
now
would
lie
in
it
no
more
would
lie
in
it
no
more
wondered
whether
had
lain
in
that
same
bed
with
thirty
minutes
stood
there
the
end
of
the
racking
his
brains
thinking
over
and
over
again
of
her
friends
her
past
he
left
the
bedroom
could
think
of
no
answer
put
on
his
coat
again
leaving
he
took
one
last
lingering
look
at
the
apartment
knew
he
would
never
see
it
again
the
street
walking
as
quickly
as
he
could
was
a
lone
figure
death
had
a
quite
different
effect
death
was
a
source
of
guilty
but
nonetheless
soaring
happy
hope
defense
it
must
be
said
she
was
unaware
of
the
newborn
hope
anyone
had
asked
her
she
would
have
described
herself
only
as
nervous
and
worried
figures
on
the
worksheet
paper
in
front
of
her
were
jumping
and
waving
around
so
badly
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
make
them
out
clearly
enough
to
copy
them
with
the
typewriter
wondered
whether
would
call
wanted
to
be
with
him
to
give
him
the
comfort
and
companionship
she
knew
he
needed
had
skipped
her
lunch
hour
in
the
fear
that
he
might
call
while
she
was
out
now
she
was
feeling
sick
both
from
concern
about
and
hunger
he
called
she
reflected
even
men
like
are
unpredictable
tried
to
think
of
his
unpredictable
actions
in
the
eleven
years
she
had
known
him
and
discovered
they
so
many
after
all
really
was
quite
predictable
was
one
of
the
things
she
liked
about
like
so
many
other
men
dentist
last
night
for
instance
and
the
movies
had
been
fine
had
taken
her
upstairs
to
say
good
night
had
invited
him
in
for
coffee
was
in
the
kitchen
as
she
was
watching
the
kettle
waiting
for
the
water
to
boil
that
he
had
grabbed
for
her
warning
without
giving
her
a
chance
to
prepare
for
it
behind
he
had
put
his
arms
on
her
shoulders
turned
her
around
and
pressed
her
to
him
so
close
she
breathe
she
apologized
for
the
long
scratch
across
his
face
tried
to
explain
she
help
herself
that
the
panic
arose
in
her
unwanted
he
understood
he
left
she
knew
she
would
never
see
him
again
like
that
could
always
predict
what
was
going
to
do
ever
since
she
first
met
him
for
that
one
morning
morning
he
walked
in
to
announce
to
her
blushing
that
he
was
married
thought
she
was
going
to
die
had
assumed
before
then
that
one
day
he
would
ask
her
to
marry
him
remember
when
she
had
first
arrived
at
this
conclusion
thought
it
was
sometime
during
the
second
week
she
worked
for
was
nothing
that
he
said
or
did
but
it
seemed
so
natural
to
her
that
she
should
be
working
for
him
looking
forward
to
his
eventual
proposal
was
years
old
then
mother
was
already
considerably
concerned
over
her
future
had
been
able
to
maintain
a
serene
and
assured
composure
in
the
face
of
her
widowed
continued
carping
had
been
able
to
resist
her
urgings
to
date
anyone
who
offered
the
slightest
possibility
of
matrimony
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
would
propose
was
to
be
expected
that
would
be
shy
slow
in
taking
such
a
momentous
step
went
along
in
life
she
knew
convinced
that
he
deserved
the
love
and
faith
of
no
woman
a
result
he
never
looked
for
it
one
day
she
expected
he
would
somehow
discover
without
her
having
to
tell
him
that
there
was
such
a
woman
in
the
world
a
woman
who
was
willing
to
give
him
love
faith
and
anything
else
a
woman
could
give
a
husband
there
was
a
woman
who
unasked
had
already
given
him
love
loved
then
unexpectedly
made
his
announcement
that
first
day
literally
thought
she
was
going
to
die
or
at
the
very
least
go
out
of
her
mind
might
have
been
easier
for
her
if
been
everything
that
was
not
was
thirty
years
younger
than
taller
than
prettier
than
had
any
right
to
hope
for
much
less
expect
could
have
married
a
score
of
men
was
no
reason
for
her
to
marry
someone
like
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
marry
had
come
into
the
office
on
recommendation
because
she
needed
help
in
preparing
her
income
tax
return
had
filled
out
the
return
and
because
when
he
was
finished
it
was
close
to
the
lunch
hour
he
had
politely
asked
to
join
him
never
expecting
her
to
accept
knew
all
this
because
the
door
to
office
was
open
and
without
straining
too
hard
she
could
hear
everything
that
was
said
had
gone
out
saying
he
would
be
back
in
an
hour
come
back
for
over
two
that
day
still
know
exactly
what
had
happened
were
mornings
when
came
in
late
afternoons
when
he
left
early
days
when
he
come
in
at
all
knew
something
must
be
causing
new
strange
behavior
but
she
never
once
connected
it
with
was
too
unprecedented
six
weeks
after
the
day
first
came
into
the
office
announced
he
and
were
married
managed
to
cover
the
stunned
surprise
and
offer
her
congratulations
night
the
two
of
them
left
for
a
honeymoon
in
they
were
away
came
into
the
office
every
morning
running
things
as
she
had
always
run
them
for
going
through
the
week
in
a
dazed
stupor
getting
things
done
automatically
out
of
habit
exactly
one
week
she
was
able
to
continue
in
this
manner
the
morning
of
return
however
her
strength
left
her
hours
of
watching
his
serenely
happy
face
listening
to
his
soft
humming
as
he
bent
over
his
penciled
figures
and
had
to
leave
stayed
away
for
ten
days
ten
days
were
like
no
others
that
had
known
she
stayed
in
bed
tell
anyone
even
her
mother
what
was
wrong
refused
to
have
a
doctor
insisting
there
was
nothing
a
doctor
could
do
for
her
said
the
fingerprint
man
if
going
to
believe
those
prints
have
to
look
for
a
killer
a
piano
player
demonstrated
by
playing
an
imaginary
piano
doing
a
staccato
passage
with
a
broadly
exaggerated
attack
make
it
clearer
he
shifted
to
acting
out
but
with
no
change
of
manner
the
killing
of
hands
snatched
at
an
imaginary
bucket
swooping
down
hard
to
grab
it
and
coming
away
with
equal
snap
like
a
ball
been
bounced
hard
the
same
way
he
pantomimed
grasping
a
mantel
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
pressing
his
hands
against
the
floor
and
bouncing
cleanly
off
that
was
moving
like
a
ballet
dancer
playing
for
laughs
killer
acted
this
way
catching
up
with
him
was
going
to
be
a
cinch
know
him
by
his
stretch
pants
and
the
flowers
wear
twined
in
his
hair
if
had
first
come
upon
us
when
this
boy
was
not
cavorting
so
gaily
up
and
down
the
hall
outside
the
murdered
apartment
we
might
have
had
less
trouble
convincing
of
our
seriousness
you
will
remember
was
still
the
time
turned
up
it
was
early
afternoon
which
one
would
think
would
be
late
enough
so
that
by
then
except
for
small
children
and
a
few
hardy
souls
who
had
not
yet
sobered
up
it
could
have
been
expected
that
people
would
no
longer
be
having
any
sort
of
active
interest
in
the
previous
noisemakers
and
paper
hats
was
the
exception
had
retained
his
hat
and
his
horn
and
whatever
fun
might
still
be
going
he
was
ready
to
join
it
incidentally
might
give
you
some
idea
of
what
was
like
all
he
happened
upon
us
in
that
hall
without
warning
boys
had
finished
their
examination
and
the
body
had
been
removed
for
autopsy
meat
wagon
therefore
was
not
out
in
front
of
the
house
any
more
but
the
cluster
of
squad
cars
was
still
there
and
there
was
a
cop
on
the
door
downstairs
to
screen
any
comings
and
goings
was
furthermore
the
crowd
of
curious
onlookers
gathered
in
the
street
and
a
couple
more
cops
to
hold
them
at
a
decent
distance
put
yourself
in
place
for
a
moment
a
taxpayer
householder
landlord
been
away
from
home
for
the
festivities
but
now
the
party
is
over
and
you
come
home
sobriety
in
the
limited
sense
of
being
free
from
the
clinical
symptoms
of
the
effects
of
alcohol
ingested
and
not
yet
eliminated
from
the
system
you
are
sober
still
have
your
paper
hat
and
wearing
it
but
then
it
is
an
extraordinary
paper
hat
and
in
addition
to
anything
else
you
may
be
you
are
also
the
sculptor
who
created
that
most
peculiar
dame
out
in
the
back
yard
not
too
much
to
assume
that
you
will
have
a
more
lasting
interest
in
paper
hats
than
will
have
your
paper
horn
clutched
in
your
big
craggy
fist
and
for
your
entrance
you
have
planned
a
noisy
colorful
and
exuberant
greeting
to
your
friends
and
tenants
find
your
house
a
focus
of
public
and
police
attention
you
imagine
yourself
forgetting
under
the
circumstances
that
you
are
approaching
this
startling
and
unexpected
situation
so
unsuitably
hatted
and
armed
with
a
paper
horn
one
could
be
startled
into
forgetfulness
shoulder
your
way
through
the
cluster
of
the
curious
and
you
barge
up
to
the
cop
on
the
door
identify
yourself
and
ask
him
going
on
of
answering
you
he
sticks
his
head
in
the
door
and
shouts
up
the
stairs
the
upstairs
guy
he
bellows
owner
send
him
up
he
turns
back
to
you
on
in
he
says
tell
you
cooking
then
as
you
go
into
the
house
oppressed
by
the
knowledge
that
something
is
cooking
and
that
your
house
has
passed
under
this
unaccountable
official
control
could
you
go
on
forgetting
that
you
still
had
that
ridiculous
hat
on
your
head
and
you
were
still
carrying
that
childish
horn
in
your
hand
getting
at
is
that
we
were
fully
prepared
for
being
an
odd
one
seen
his
handiwork
out
in
the
back
yard
and
the
little
his
tenants
had
told
us
of
him
did
make
him
sound
a
little
special
were
not
however
prepared
for
anything
like
the
apparition
that
confronted
us
as
came
up
the
stairs
of
course
must
have
been
equally
unprepared
for
what
confronted
him
but
nonetheless
did
find
his
reaction
startling
was
still
wearing
the
hat
and
carrying
the
horn
because
forgotten
about
them
he
now
remembered
came
bounding
up
the
stairs
and
joined
the
dance
adjusted
the
hat
lifted
the
horn
to
his
lips
as
though
it
were
a
flute
and
fell
in
alongside
our
fingerprint
expert
to
cavort
with
him
man
stopped
dead
and
glowered
at
threw
his
head
back
and
laughed
a
laugh
that
shook
the
timbers
of
even
that
solidly
built
old
house
was
a
bull
of
a
man
was
and
face
was
ruddy
and
heavy
and
unlined
and
when
he
laughed
he
showed
his
teeth
which
were
big
and
white
and
strong
and
unquestionably
remember
ever
seeing
teeth
that
were
quite
so
white
and
at
the
same
time
quite
so
emphatically
not
dentures
hair
had
receded
most
of
the
way
to
the
back
of
his
neck
had
only
a
fringe
of
hair
and
he
wore
it
cropped
short
was
almost
as
white
as
his
teeth
a
man
of
his
mass
he
was
curiously
short
a
dwarf
but
he
was
a
bit
of
a
comic
figure
man
with
so
big
and
so
staggeringly
developed
a
torso
and
such
long
and
powerful
arms
is
expected
to
stand
taller
than
five
feet
five
it
was
a
bit
of
a
stretch
to
make
even
that
measurement
man
was
just
this
side
of
being
a
freak
waited
till
he
had
finished
laughing
and
that
gave
us
a
few
moments
for
taking
stock
of
him
was
dressed
in
a
manner
might
suggest
for
the
outdoor
country
weekend
gray
sports
jacket
lighter
gray
slacks
pink
flannel
shirt
black
silk
necktie
eyes
were
clear
was
freshly
shaved
and
if
there
had
been
any
alcohol
in
him
we
could
never
have
missed
detecting
some
scent
of
it
on
the
massive
gusts
of
his
laughter
even
a
whiff
he
subsided
said
he
said
merrily
the
happy
one
much
we
remember
said
dryly
always
live
up
to
your
name
always
like
this
always
making
happy
try
said
blithely
world
is
full
of
blokes
who
put
their
hearts
into
making
the
tragic
scene
never
noticed
that
it
improves
things
any
for
you
said
the
rest
of
your
name
rest
of
it
is
all
there
is
there
ever
was
past
leave
to
historians
intoned
demonstrating
that
he
could
be
pompous
as
well
as
happy
live
in
the
present
the
present
proclaimed
the
future
there
any
other
time
in
which
a
man
can
live
announced
are
not
philosophers
are
gentleman
is
a
police
officer
is
a
fingerprint
specialist
your
future
your
immediate
future
be
made
to
include
taking
us
upstairs
giving
us
a
bit
of
space
in
which
our
friend
can
work
and
making
available
to
him
your
finger
tips
happy
one
could
never
have
looked
happier
was
more
than
joy
was
ecstasy
lovely
whorls
he
chortled
intricate
so
beautiful
right
along
love
fingerprints
was
prancing
along
the
hall
heading
for
the
next
flight
of
stairs
called
him
back
here
because
of
what
happened
last
night
he
said
yes
but
important
it
is
important
for
the
record
have
the
full
name
important
asked
important
whispered
asked
not
bothering
to
whisper
implored
see
what
would
make
it
necessary
for
you
to
know
could
make
it
necessary
to
proclaim
it
to
the
whole
world
lowered
his
voice
repeated
but
not
for
years
years
been
just
thing
did
after
my
birthday
was
go
into
court
and
have
it
officially
changed
and
this
is
something
tell
everybody
was
almost
forty
years
ago
volunteered
that
he
was
a
man
of
about
sixty
he
bounded
up
the
stairs
and
with
each
leap
rendered
the
number
less
credible
was
a
broth
of
a
boy
our
and
nothing
was
more
obvious
than
the
joy
he
took
in
demonstrating
how
agile
he
was
and
how
full
of
juice
and
spirit
followed
him
up
the
stairs
cops
would
gather
up
and
the
foursome
on
the
third
floor
and
bring
us
those
of
them
who
would
voluntarily
submit
to
fingerprinting
may
think
we
need
and
but
you
always
get
what
you
can
when
you
can
and
we
had
no
guarantee
that
a
fingerprint
record
on
them
be
useful
before
we
were
through
with
this
case
if
we
had
excluded
the
ladies
we
would
have
to
that
extent
let
the
whole
world
know
at
least
that
much
of
where
we
stood
killer
if
in
our
present
group
would
certainly
be
interested
in
knowing
that
much
and
even
though
with
the
fingerprint
evidence
what
it
was
could
see
no
way
he
could
use
this
bit
of
information
to
improve
on
his
situation
there
might
always
be
some
way
you
can
possibly
avoid
it
you
hand
out
any
extra
chances
took
us
into
his
studio
was
that
oddly
shaped
space
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
where
ceiling
heights
had
to
accommodate
themselves
to
the
varying
angles
of
roof
slope
each
angle
of
its
pitch
a
big
skylight
had
been
fitted
into
the
roof
and
all
these
skylights
were
fitted
with
systems
of
multiple
screens
and
shades
first
opened
the
door
on
it
all
these
shades
were
tightly
drawn
and
the
whole
studio
was
as
dark
as
night
quickly
fixed
that
rolling
back
the
shades
on
some
of
the
skylights
and
adjusting
screens
on
the
others
flew
about
the
place
making
these
adjustments
and
it
was
obvious
that
what
he
was
doing
was
the
fruit
of
long
experience
of
his
movements
was
tentative
was
no
process
of
trial
and
error
with
the
room
completely
blacked
out
as
it
was
when
we
came
in
he
unerringly
fixed
things
so
that
the
whole
place
was
bathed
in
the
maximum
of
light
without
at
any
point
admitting
even
so
much
as
a
crack
of
glare
something
wacky
was
surprised
by
what
we
found
was
no
display
of
either
works
in
progress
or
of
finished
work
and
there
on
work
table
or
pedestal
stood
a
shape
with
a
sheet
or
a
tarpaulin
draped
over
it
shapes
might
have
been
mad
but
there
was
no
telling
were
all
completely
shrouded
equipment
was
solid
and
heavy
and
in
good
condition
was
orderly
and
it
seemed
to
be
arranged
for
the
comfort
convenience
and
efficiency
were
tools
about
but
they
were
neatly
kept
was
no
confusion
and
no
litter
of
sheet
metal
were
neatly
stacked
in
bins
did
not
see
the
newspapers
the
next
day
on
his
staff
he
suspected
it
was
intercepted
them
and
for
this
was
grateful
finally
fell
asleep
around
six
in
the
morning
with
the
aid
of
a
sleeping
capsule
a
crutch
he
rarely
used
and
awaken
until
early
afternoon
flooded
him
the
instant
he
opened
his
eyes
and
the
sick
feeling
knotted
his
stomach
his
window
bloomed
a
beautiful
summer
day
the
same
sun
was
shining
upon
little
also
and
those
who
had
kidnapped
him
where
was
still
a
very
big
world
despite
all
the
modern
cant
to
the
contrary
was
sitting
in
a
chair
that
blocked
the
hall
door
was
dozing
perhaps
the
only
sleep
gotten
snapped
to
alertness
at
entrance
new
of
people
waiting
to
see
you
though
own
people
about
the
show
tonight
picked
up
the
telephone
let
them
know
awake
suppose
do
you
know
considered
better
got
plenty
of
guts
want
me
to
call
her
expecting
me
to
shook
his
head
so
told
him
not
to
bother
only
reason
for
contacting
was
to
comfort
or
to
be
comforted
could
not
manage
the
former
or
expect
the
latter
they
had
nothing
to
give
to
each
other
omission
might
look
peculiar
to
outsiders
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
go
through
the
motions
simply
for
the
sake
of
appearances
had
little
time
to
himself
anyway
the
afternoon
sped
toward
evening
the
suite
saw
a
steady
procession
of
aides
pass
in
and
out
each
with
his
own
special
problem
arrived
with
the
writers
had
spent
the
morning
revising
the
act
eliminating
all
the
gay
songs
patter
and
dancing
with
a
view
of
the
best
public
relations
remained
lacked
the
original
verve
but
it
was
at
least
dignified
as
befitting
the
tragic
circumstances
reported
that
the
orchestra
had
hastily
rehearsed
in
case
it
was
needed
was
back
and
forth
on
several
occasions
first
to
confer
with
on
the
advisability
of
cancelling
the
engagement
they
decided
it
was
wise
and
later
to
announce
that
a
prominent
comedian
also
an
agency
client
had
agreed
to
fill
the
open
date
once
slipped
in
pale
and
drawn

still
on
his
breath
with
some
of
added
to
it
asked
if
there
was
anything
he
could
do
invented
a
job
to
keep
him
busy
sending
him
ahead
to
to
supervise
last
minute
arrangements
from
they
heard
nothing
last
it
was
time
to
depart
nosing
about
spotted
reporters
in
the
lobby
so
was
hustled
away
quietly
through
the
service
entrance
in
a
strange
car
which
had
procured
somewhere
succeeded
in
eluding
the
curious
at
the
hotel
but
there
was
no
chance
of
avoiding
them
at
the
nightclub
was
surrounded
by
a
mob
overflowed
the
parking
lot
making
progress
by
automobile
difficult
before
he
reached
the
protection
of
the
stage
door
was
recognized
of
his
arrival
spread
through
the
crowd
like
a
brushfire
surged
around
him
fingers
pointing
eyes
prying
was
not
a
hostile
gathering
but
sensed
the
difference
from
last
had
come
not
to
admire
but
to
observe
worse
inside
informed
jammed
in
every
table

could
find

was
tomblike
by
contrast
kept
their
distance
awed
by
the
tragedy
in
his
dressing
room

and
a

the
point
where
he
could

gathered
that
this
had
been
no
small
accomplishment
himself
looked
better
any

better
than
brooding
told
him
wish

if
some
kind
of

be
rigged
up

just
barely
possible
with
this
crowd
that
the

able
to

got
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
those
damn
loudspeakers
rolled
up
the
revised
script
he
had
been
studying
about
them
going
to
louse
me
up
good
men
have
been
here
all
afternoon
setting
up
for
this
thing
explained
that
with
the
cooperation
the
police
had
occupied
like
a
battlefield
picture
cameras
had
been
installed
to
film
the
audience
the
reservation
list
was
being
checked
out
name
by
name
and
a
special
detail
was
already
at
work
in
the
parking
lot
scrutinizing
automobiles
for
a
possible
lead
it
was
virtually
impossible
to
screen
the
mob
outside
even
if
had
manpower
available
for
the
purpose
want
you
to
have
the
speakers
taken
out
sighed
like
never
going
to
see
eye
to
eye
they
tell
you
what
wanted
the
system
for
know
such
a
long
shot
longer
than
yours
do
you
expect
to
get
tonight
anyway
think
somebody
is
going
to
stand
up
in
the
audience
and
make
guilty
faces
have
a
sign
on
his
car
that
says
the
crumbled
the
script
in
his
fist
stop
you
from
doing
what
you
think
is
right
try
to
stop
me
